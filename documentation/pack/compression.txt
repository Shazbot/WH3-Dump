If you want to compress the files in your mod packs you can use one of the supported compression formats.
There are two flags which can be specified in rules.bob files which can be used to turn on compression for particular files: Compressed and CompressionType.
	- Compressed flag specifies whether you want those files to get compressed or not. Possible values: true/false
	- CompressionType flag specifies the concrete compression type to use. Possible values: ZSTD/LZ4

For example if you want to compress with LZ4 use this:

[Pack]
...
	Compressed = true
	CompressionType = LZ4
...

and if you want to compress with ZSTD us this:

[Pack]
...
	Compressed = true
	CompressionType = ZSTD
...


Certain types of resources should not be compressed and compression support is not guaranteed for them:
	- audio files - no benefit for compression
	- video files (*.ca_vp8) - no benefit for compression
	- models (*.rigid_model_v2) - careful, may add load overhead in certain cases, prefer LZ4 if absolutely needed
