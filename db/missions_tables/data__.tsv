He swiftly rose to become a powerful high priest, but envy of his brother, who succeeded their father as king, burned within Nagash like a brazier coal.

Seeking greater power, he threw himself into the study of Dark Magic, melding it with Necromancy to unlock the very secrets of eternal life.

Ascending to the dark Sorcerer's altar, the emaciated king caught Nagash mid-ritual: he bellowed a final war-cry and ran the sorcerer through with the crackling blade.

wh2_dlc11_qb_cst_luthor_harkon_slann_gold_MP	MOVE_TO_REGION	Slann Gold	Luthor Harkon had been looking for a way to restore his connection to the Winds of Magic for decades. Many years ago, he disturbed an ancient chamber sealed with some powerful glyphs, resulting in his mind being shattered into a dozen different facets which left him teetering on the brink of insanity. Luthor thought it likely that the glyphs were of Slann origin, concluding that the best chance he had to undo his impairments was to find powerful artefacts from the same source.\n\The Slann – a powerful species of Lizardmen with an unparalleled mastery over the Sorcerous arts – are known to use many enchanted totems and trinkets of gold to serve their indecipherable purposes. The best chance of finding one was to search the most ancient ruins of the long-abandoned cities and towns of Lustria and beyond, where the Slann were most likely to have left their mark. After searching countless ruins, Luthor and his pirate horde came across a shackled slave claiming to have been a former soldier of the Empire. He told Luthor that he had recently been part of an expeditionary force that found a chest of embossed Slann Gold, but on their way back to camp they were ambushed by a vast Lizardmen army, the largest he had ever seen. The soldier narrowly escaped with his life, but everyone in his troop was slaughtered and the Lizardmen made off back to Lustria with their gold.\n\nClearly this hoard is of great importance to the Lizardmen for them to have brought such a force to take it back – there must be more to this gold than its monetary value alone.

It seems that not a day goes by without the news of some horrible tropical disease striking some poor settler down. The most innocuous cut or scratch sustained here can become horribly infected within hours, making every trek into the jungle a highly risky endeavour indeed.\n\nPerhaps by fate, word has reached me of a mysterious individual who shadows the Empire’s troops in the deep jungle, patching up the wounds of the gravely injured left behind following skirmishes with the lizards. Men thought to be well within Morr’s deathly embrace have been mysteriously brought back from the brink by someone who clearly has advanced medical training, with even the most horrendous injuries cleaned, disinfected, and stitched as if by the hands of the most highly-trained physician in all of the Empire. Our very own injured relate to me their encounters with this healer, not remembering much other than glimpses of a necklace of fangs – trophies perhaps?\n\nI have been in few environments more treacherous to man than Lustria; it goes without saying that for us to endure here, we should somehow reach out to this ‘medic’ and persuade them to join our cause.	emp/generic	rom_event_mission.png	false	false	wulfharts_hunters		0	0	true	false	0.0000		false		false

He bears the surname of a well-known ancient lineage of Witch Hunters, but for reasons unknown to me he seems rather ashamed of it. When I brought it up he responded angrily, claiming his vocation as a Witch Hunter was not of his choosing. He then quickly changed the subject, revealing that he was a master physician of Altdorf and insisted I address him as ‘Herr Doctor’. It truly beguiles me why a physician from Altdorf is carrying out Witch Hunter duties in Lustria, but I am not one to poke about in another man’s private affairs.\n\nThere is certainly much more to Herr Doctor which perhaps in time he will reveal on his own volition, but right now he has temporarily left camp. Before leaving, he told me he intends to track down some information about one particular Vampire he has been searching for called Alistair the Red. He has given me assurances that I cannot help him with this particular task and that he will return soon.	emp/generic	rom_event_mission.png	false	false	wulfharts_hunters		0	0	true	false	0.0000		false		false

He is ruthlessly obsessed with destroying Vampires, but is also a skilful healer with astounding convalescent skills. I felt I had built up enough of a rapport to bring up the subject of his famous lineage once again.\n\nWith a deep sigh, Hertwig explained his intense hate for the van Hal name, for his ambition was always to preserve life and not to chase destruction. For him, the van Hals would never be innocent of their progenitor’s sins and he wanted nothing to do with them. "A man can try to avoid his destiny as much as he wants," he added, "but in the end it will always find him." He would elaborate no further. \n\nThe next day, he invoked me to continue helping him with his mission to track down Alistair the Red. He says the best way to draw attention from a Vampire Pirate is to raid their lands and waters, so that is what we will do. It is certainly not without a touch of irony that we are probably about to steal from pirates.	emp/generic	rom_event_mission.png	false	false	wulfharts_hunters		0	0	true	false	0.0000		false		false

Having observed Hertwig slay dozens of Vampires up to now, it is clear he gains no pleasure from it, but at the same time carries out Witch Hunter duties with the aptitude of one who was born to do so – like a true van Hal. Though my curiosity threatens to overcome me, I have resisted asking further questions about the history of this man I have befriended. It seems there is no time for it anyway, as Herr Doctor now wants us to mobilise against The Awakening, and immediately.\n\nThose who know anything about the area say the place is a husk of an old colony that was settled many years ago, but was left haunted, derelict, and overrun by the Undead. There is a lot of unknown history there, but Hertwig is convinced its winding streets and deep catacombs harbour the creature that he seeks to destroy.  A direct assault on this place seems dangerous, but I am a man of my word and Herr Doctor assures us he is very close to achieving his goal.	emp/generic	rom_event_mission.png	false	false	wulfharts_hunters		0	0	true	false	0.0000		false		false

He cared little for the affairs of Witch Hunters, dedicating his life only to the practise of medicine and his beloved fiancé Matilda. One evening, a red-haired corpse was brought to his surgery with a stake mysteriously plunged through its heart. The young, naïve doctor removed the stake during the examination and later that night found the creature with its fangs buried in Matilda's neck. He desperately fought the vile monster off before it fled, but it was too late. To prevent Matilda from rising from the dead, he had no choice but to stab her through the heart and remove her head. Beset by anguish and grief, van Hal felt he had no choice but to dedicate himself to the destruction of creatures of the night.\n\nWith the red-haired Vampire that killed his beloved now slain, he is grateful for my help and guidance and will serve the expedition indefinitely.	emp/generic	rom_event_mission.png	false	false	wulfharts_hunters		0	0	true	false	0.0000		false		false

wh2_dlc13_wulfhart_jorek_grimm_stage_1	MOVE_TO_PROVINCE	I. The Lizards' Bane	The colonists have long known about Lizardmen mining convoys that regularly travel along established trails in the deep jungle like clockwork. They transport some sort of glossy black raw material that resembles obsidian, the dense metal that the Wizards of home know all too well for its anti-magic properties. There was some concern when these convoy movements inexplicably stopped, perhaps now taking different routes if not ceasing altogether. I was unconcerned, but apparently the lizards don’t change their ways without very good reason. To appease the colonists, I sent out an expedition to investigate the old trails and they soon returned with a captive – a Skink, one of the convoy overseers.\n\nWhen our Saurian translator asked the skittish creature about the black material, it held its forked tongue. Further ‘prodding’ with my hunting knife made the creature reveal something about a "short, bearded warmblood" that had been repeatedly stealing from their convoys, forcing them to change their routes.\n\nWhat is a Dwarf doing this far from the Spine of Sotek mountains? This Dawi is either incredibly brave or incredibly stupid to be harassing the Lizardmen on their own turf, but is getting away with it somehow.

A Secretive Dwarf	It is truly astonishing how this Dawi Engineer has been able to survive out in the wild on his solo forays against the Lizardmen's convoys, but it is clearly down to his own ingenuity. A keen and talented inventor, Jorek seems to have all sorts of survivalist equipment at his disposal, all designed and built himself. He is very secretive about his past, revealing little more than the location of his previous home back in the Old World, the great Dwarf port of Barak Varr.\n\nIt seems that something in Jorek’s earlier life clearly irks him, which really isn’t all that surprising – Dwarfs feel all wrongdoings committed against them as if they had only just happened. With wild eyes he tells me that he is destined for great things, but must "rebuild his reputation, one invention at a time". Though he appears sceptical that we can really help him, he sees value in the protection the expedition can provide on his travels through Lustria. He has also suggested we gather some resources for some new inventions he thinks may prove useful to him and the expedition.	emp/generic	rom_event_mission.png	false	false	wulfharts_hunters		0	0	true	false	0.0000		false		false
wh2_dlc13_wulfhart_jorek_grimm_stage_3	HAVE_RESOURCES	III. Jorek of the Jungle	I am amazed by this Dwarf’s ambition and enthusiasm for invention. He seems to find a use for any kind of material he can find and gets excited about all the unique resources we come across. This obsession with metallurgy and mineralogy has made it clearer to me why he is here – the Lustrian jungle is one of the most unexplored places in the known world, offering many mysterious raw materials with strange and amazing properties to a tinkerer like Jorek.\n\nGradually, the Master Engineer has also become more open about his past. Given his chosen surroundings, I was surprised to discover that he was once a great shipbuilder but had been shunned and ousted by the Engineers' Guild back in Barak Varr. According to him, his contemporaries considered him a threat because of his intellectual brilliance, although I have a feeling there are elements to this story he has not revealed. It is perhaps unwise to probe any further; I can never hope to understand the confusing, stubborn, grudge-holding ways of the Dawi anyway. As long as Jorek continues to help the expedition, we will continue to supply him with the materials he needs.	emp/generic	rom_event_mission.png	false	false	wulfharts_hunters		0	0	true	false	0.0000		false		false
wh2_dlc13_wulfhart_jorek_grimm_stage_4	HAVE_RESOURCES	IV. Fight & Flight	Jorek has revealed to me that he has been working on something big. He described it as a "masterpiece of gyro-powered flight", a flying machine he claims will be better than any Gyrocopter built by his kin anywhere in the world. All he needs to complete its assembly is a chunk of a rare metal called 'obsinite', a form of Lustrian obsidian used by the Lizardmen that is harder and more durable than steel. With the Lizardmen's mining convoys having now changed their routes to avoid Jorek’s thieving attentions, we’ll have to find a different source of the metal. He tells me he has a hidden stockpile collected from his previous smash-'n'-grab attacks, located on the Volcanic Islands off the east coast of Lustria. Alternatively, he also knows of a consignment of obsinite heading north towards the Ancient City of Quintex.\n\nBy the sounds of it, the flying machine Jorek intends to build would be a very welcome addition to the expedition's armoury. This may very well be worth the effort!	emp/generic	rom_event_mission.png	false	false	wulfharts_hunters		0	0	true	false	0.0000		false		false

The Expedition's Engineer	In return for helping him obtain all the raw materials he has desired thus far, Jorek has accepted a permanent position with my expedition. This is most fortunate, for he has proven himself a valuable member of the hunting party, whose unique skills make him integral to our mission. More than that, Jorek has become a loyal friend. One day, as we enjoyed a barrel of Bugman’s together, he revealed to me the rest of his sorry story.\n\nOnce a member of the Cragbrow Clan of Barak Varr, Jorek was commissioned to design new steamships for his throng, but utilised methods of engineering that eschewed Dwarf traditions. He knew there was great potential in his designs regardless of the techniques used to develop them, but could never see them through to completion due to sabotage by his jealous, ultra-traditionalist peers. In the end, Jorek was ousted from the Engineers' Guild and left for good. Truly, the Dwarfs are a strange lot!\n\nNow with the freedom and raw materials to develop any invention he chooses, I have never seen a happier Dwarf in all my life. I have little doubt that in time the potential brainchildren of this brilliant inventor will help turn the tide of our struggle here in Lustria.	emp/generic	rom_event_mission.png	false	false	wulfharts_hunters		0	0	true	false	0.0000		false		false
wh2_dlc13_wulfhart_kalara_stage_1	HAVE_AT_LEAST_X_OF_A_POOLED_RESOURCE	I. The Ghost in the Jungle	The colonists speak of something strange living in the nearby jungles. They say it is not of the lizards, nor of the ratmen that infest this continent, but something else; a "ghost" they call it. Part of me thinks this gods-forsaken place drives some men to hallucinations, but today a hunting party returned with a curious tale. They had been tracking a wild Bastiladon whose carcass would have provided much sustenance for the colonists, and had trapped the great beast in a bog. They claim that as they moved in for the kill, it was unexpectedly struck down by an arrow propelled through the thick jungle canopy directly into one of its eyes.\n\nSuch frightening huntsmanship could only be supernatural. In this flora-covered terrain, it is almost impossible to hit a moving Bastiladon’s weak points from range as the men described. Furthermore, they claim they were then threatened by a mysterious, hooded figure in the trees above them, a sorrowful voice of a woman telling them "whosoever approaches my bounty will share its fate".\n\nPerhaps this is the "ghost" the colonists speak of? Whatever it is, to kill a Bastiladon in such a way requires a level of precision far exceeding that of any huntsman I’ve ever met.	emp/generic	rom_event_mission.png	false	false	wulfharts_hunters		0	0	true	false	0.0000		false		false

Huntress of the Fey	I have met a few of the elusive fey folk of Athel Loren, and in my early dealings with Kalara it certainly appears she is typical of her kind. On the rare occasions in the past when my hunting expeditions unwittingly led me into the Wood Elves’ realm, I found them to be standoffish and determinedly detached from the outside world – almost aggressively so. Those familiar with the Asrai know better than to trespass upon their hunting grounds, for they are considered to be some of the most lethal hunters in the known world. We are extremely fortunate to have brought a Waystalker into our ranks, regardless of how aloof she may be.\n\nKalara told me that she has been in Lustria for quite some time. The beast she seeks does not prowl these lands alone though and bringing it down will take some fight, which is why she requested our assistance. For a Waystalker to admit that a quarry is beyond her talent confirms what an incredibly dangerous monster it must be. I gave her assurances that I would see this hunt through, but for now we await more information regarding the beast’s whereabouts.	emp/generic	rom_event_mission.png	false	false	wulfharts_hunters		0	0	true	false	0.0000		false		false

She seems restless to slay this beast, but knows little about its actual nature. I find it curious as to why she seeks a quarry which is largely a mystery to her… but in truth I am simply glad to have her strength added to our own, so see no need to push the question. We are mobilising now anyway, as news has reached camp that a treasure-seeking convoy of about fifty-or-so men disappeared into some nearby ruins. Kalara insisted she investigate and came back describing a grisly scene. Little was left of the mutilated men, she said, and she is convinced it is connected to the beast we are hunting.\n\nThough I respect Kalara greatly, I feel she has not been entirely forthcoming with us. She might not be lying about what she has seen this time, but I do believe she is withholding something about the motives for her Lustrian hunt. For this reason, I’ve decided to take the expedition and investigate this ruin myself.	emp/generic	rom_event_mission.png	false	false	wulfharts_hunters		0	0	true	false	0.0000		false		false

Wrath of a God	I started having reservations about the true nature of the beast Kalara is pursuing, and even considered calling off this hunt – but then she revealed something quite astounding.\n\nIt is her sincere belief that the beast she hunts contains the reincarnated soul of her dead lover. She explained that as punishment from the one called Kurnous, the Elven God of the Hunt, Kalara’s beloved is in an endless cycle of life and death, always coming back as a murderous beast after it is slain. She has killed several versions of the beast before, and is determined to end the cycle once and for all, so her love may finally pass into the afterlife. She believes almost obsessively that Kurnous is testing her, for she always finds that the lost soul of her lover passes into a more unkillable beast than the one before it.\n\nTruly, the Elven gods are stranger than those of men. Out of empathy for Kalara’s loss, I have decided to continue helping her for now. We must cast our net out wide and interrogate the Dark Ones to the north as well as the lizards to the south to see what they know of this beast.	emp/generic	rom_event_mission.png	false	false	wulfharts_hunters		0	0	true	false	0.0000		false		false

To my surprise, she agreed, but implored me to help her with one final task. I accepted on the sole condition she tell me everything.\n\nKalara revealed she was once a princess of Wydrioth, a High Realm of Athel Loren. Her lover Atherin was a Wild Rider of Kurnous, the personal guard of Athel Loren’s king. Atherin violated his oath to sever all worldly ties, persisting in his relationship with Kalara and even revealing his order’s hallowed secrets to her. Kurnous vengefully transformed Atherin into a mighty stag before cruelly leading Kalara to unwittingly hunt it down. Discovering the stag’s true nature, Kalara eventually learned of Atherin’s cursed fate of eternal reincarnation as a beast.\n\nShe had also recently been visited in her dreams by the goddess Isha, mother of the Elven race and consort to Kurnous himself. A great privilege, she said, for Isha is usually forbidden to have any contact with her worldly children. The goddess offered Kalara another route to freeing her lover's soul – instead of further destruction, she must make a worldly display of love and construct a shrine directly on the banks of Itza’s fabled Emerald Pools.	emp/generic	rom_event_mission.png	false	false	wulfharts_hunters		0	0	true	false	0.0000		false		false
wh2_dlc13_wulfhart_rodrik_languille_stage_1	MOVE_TO_REGION	I. Chivalrous Fools	It caught my attention recently to hear of a swordsman who had become army-less after miraculously escaping a slaughter at the hands of the lizard-beasts. A possible recruit? If my memory serves me correctly, he had arrived months earlier on a galleon that was flying a flag of a Bretonnian dukedom unknown to me, though I know little of the Land of Chivalry. He had disembarked with a group of men who looked vaguely Knightly in appearance, but it was unclear whether they were individuals of any important political status. Their retinue was quite poorly equipped, as were they themselves. After buying what additional weapons and supplies they could from the colonists, they foolhardily headed straight into the jungle.\n\nWhether out of prudence of curiosity, I had them followed and watched. Unsurprisingly, word eventually returned that the Bretonnians were ill-prepared for their foray, losing half their retinue to disease and attacks before stumbling into the mists surrounding the ancient temple-city of Xlanhuapec. Thinking it was uninhabited, they attempted to plunder the city but instead suffered a catastrophic slaughter at the hands of the Lizardmen in a painfully predictable ambush.\n\nThe one survivor – this swordsman – had somehow fought himself out of the trap and was still out there.	emp/generic	rom_event_mission.png	false	false	wulfharts_hunters		0	0	true	false	0.0000		false		false

He must be, for he has witnessed many terrible things while on his doomed journey. He has told me stories of men being swallowed up by monstrous things lurking in the waist-deep bogs they waded through on the trek, only to be spat out again in a spray of bloody gore. And then of the slaughter at Xlanhuapec itself; how he and his men observed the temple-city to be totally uninhabited as they entered, getting all the way into the central plaza before being set upon by a swarm of twelve foot tall reptilian monsters with daggers for teeth. Though he had fought out of his skin to survive and escape, in reality many of his men had fell trying to protect him.\n\nRodrik clearly yearns for vengeance, but there is also a downtroddenness to his character which I think goes far deeper than just the recent loss of his men. Maybe it is the reason why he came here in the first place, which he hasn’t really talked about? Right now, Xlanhuapec is in range for a potentially successful assault which needs to be capitalised upon without delay.	emp/generic	rom_event_mission.png	false	false	wulfharts_hunters		0	0	true	false	0.0000		false		false
wh2_dlc13_wulfhart_rodrik_languille_stage_3	ACHIEVE_CHARACTER_RANK	III. A Bretonnian Without a Home	After avenging the death of his men at Xlanhuapec, I have realised more and more that Rodrik still bears within him a great resentment of something deeper. The only thing he has revealed thus far is that there are those back home in his dukedom of Anguille who would sooner see him dead than allow him to return. However, I have developed too much respect for the man just to ask about what sounds like a complicated past. After all, many an ill-advised adventurer has come to seek riches in this place for one reason or another, most of whom underestimate how terrifying a place Lustria really is.\n\n The galleons that steadily trickle into the New World colonies constantly bring greedy fools from the Old World, who have unwisely braved the perilous crossing of the Great Ocean just for an opportunity to plunder cities they are not sure even exist. Of course, they all become lizard-feed in the end – but not Rodrik. He may very well be one of these greedy fools, but to have faced the Lizardmen and survived marks him out as a warrior we could really do with having around regardless of his past indiscretions.	emp/generic	rom_event_mission.png	false	false	wulfharts_hunters		0	0	true	false	0.0000		false		false
wh2_dlc13_wulfhart_rodrik_languille_stage_4	MOVE_TO_REGION	IV. The Unfavoured Heir	To help our friend Rodrik I have ordered the expedition to march towards Pox Marsh. There, he claims, we will intercept the assassins who wish him dead before they even know what hit them. One evening, as we pitched camp for the night along the route, Rodrik pulled me away from the campfire for a private word. With a deep sadness to his tone, he revealed that Lord Tudual – the unsavoury individual who had ordered his death – is actually the duke of Anguille, Rodrik’s homeland. But even more shocking is the fact that this Duke Tudual is actually Rodrik’s father. So Rodrik is a prince of Anguille! He went on to explain that he is an 'unfavoured' heir, seen as a threat to Duke Tudual’s desired successor, Rodrik’s younger brother.\n\nThe reason why Rodrik came here with only a ragtag force in the first place has now become clear – Duke Tudual had sent his son to Lustria under the guise of wanting him to prove himself, but in reality was counting on him perishing. It seems the duke underestimated both Rodrik's skill as swordsman and his will to live. I have reassured Rodrik that he has nothing to fear and together we shall vanquish these would-be assassins.	emp/generic	rom_event_mission.png	false	false	wulfharts_hunters		0	0	true	false	0.0000		false		false
wh2_dlc13_wulfhart_rodrik_languille_stage_5	ACHIEVE_CHARACTER_RANK	V. A Prince Born of a Pauper	What a sorry state of affairs this truly is for Prince Rodrik. We dealt with Duke Tudual’s assassins without issue, but only time will tell if this will be the last attempt to prevent his son from returning to Anguille. Rodrik himself seems uninterested in returning anyway – he tells me he has no intention of claiming power in a land he now feels no attachment to, for the jungle has become his home.\n\nThe last piece of Rodrik story – the reason why his father wants him dead – had eluded me until recently, simply because Rodrik had kept it secret. Now I know why, for it is a source of great shame for him. Though Rodrik was his father’s eldest son, his mother was a commoner who was Duke Tudual’s peasant concubine. Fearing he would have no other sons, the duke recognised and brought Rodrik into his household from birth, but when Rodrik’s younger brother was unexpectedly born of the duke’s lawful wife, Rodrik was foresaken.\n\nPrince Rodrik remains the rightful heir to the dukedom of Anguille, and as long as he lives it is feasible that Duke Tudual will attempt to remove him by sending assassins once again. As always, we must stay vigilant on his behalf.	emp/generic	rom_event_mission.png	false	false	wulfharts_hunters		0	0	true	false	0.0000		false		false

Tz’arkan, the Drinker of Worlds, is a ravenous monster inextricably bound to the soul of a living entity.

If it had not been for the sinister encouragement of his power-crazed Shaman Ol’ Blacktoof, Grom’s ambitions may not have always been backed up by his actions, and he certainly wouldn't have gotten off his corpulent rump to lead Broken Axe’s first invasion of Yvresse. Unfortunately, Blacktoof eventually had his head lopped off by that pointy-‘eaded git Eltharion, but before that had absorbed copious amounts of power from destroyed Waystones. So much power, in fact, that it made him rather difficult to actually be killed, even after having his head severed from his body.\n\nBefore Grom had given up on rallying his fleeing troops from Tor Yvresse, he’d spotted his Shaman’s head on the ground shrieking angry obscenities at him, so he put it in a jar before fleeing himself. Since that day, Blacktoof’s head mostly spurted unintelligible nonsense – being devoid of a body can do that to an Orc. Recently, however, he started saying things that grabbed Grom’s attention, claiming that he knew how to get the Waaagh! going again. The first thing he suggested Grom do, however, is throw a feast to motivate the ladz.\n\nNever turning down an excuse for a banquet, Grom bellows to them to grab some scrap to get the cauldron fire going, and now!	grn/generic	rom_event_mission.png	false	false	Military		0	0	true	false	0.0000		false	Success!

It was obvious that the bitter Shaman was after some long overdue revenge on the Warden himself, the glint of the Elven general’s sword being the last thing the Shaman saw before his untimely decapitation. Grom was too distracted to think about the crazy Shaman’s personal vendetta, since he had his own motivations to return to the pointy-'eads' glittering city. He'd long dreamt of sailing back there to have another good scrap, but this time claiming the metropolis as his greatest prize – and of course, holding the banquet to end all banquets in his own triumphant honour!\n\nBefore Grom could shove a bit more of the cooked carrion into his massive gob, Blacktoof’s head drew his attention to a Food Merchant who had shown up nearby in the lumbering form of a Troll Hag. Grom couldn’t immediately figure out how, but the Shaman suggested that perhaps the Troll Hag could help them. In any event, Grom was always enticed by the possibility of sinking his teeth into any new, exotic things the Food Merchant might sell him.	grn/generic	rom_event_mission.png	false	false	Military		0	0	true	false	0.0000		false	Success!

The Shaman said that although making the crossing would be much easier this time, getting across Ulthuan's soil and into the city would not be. He had seen that the pointy-‘ead Warden had used every method possible to reinforce his realm’s defences, the walls of the city built thicker, the blanketing mists more lethal than ever. Luckily for them, by channeling the power he'd sapped from the ruined Waystones, Blacktoof had worked out the precise limitations of the mists’ power. Every time Grom feasted, his waistline, strength, and battle prowess would grow, eventually reaching a point when he would be able to penetrate the murk.\n\nTo get to the gates of Tor Yvresse, then, Grom needs only to keep eating as many different dishes as he can!	grn/generic	rom_event_mission.png	false	false	Military		0	0	true	false	0.0000		false	Success!

Despite your kin's efforts to right those perceived wrongs, the Dwarfs have never once considered striking an entry against the fey folk from the Book of Grudges in thanks. The great treeman Elder Durthu has grown weary of their discourtesy and could become a valuable ally should you decide to punish them.	bst/generic	rom_event_mission.png	false	false	Military		0	0	false	false	0.0000		true		false
wh2_dlc16_wef_confederation_mission_bowmen_of_oreon	DEFEAT_N_ARMIES_OF_FACTION	The Lay of Oreon’s Folly	The fey folk do not take kindly to those of their own who turn their backs on Athel Loren. To do so is not only to forsake their kin, but the very Weave itself. Many Asrai know the tale of Oreon, a Glade Prince who one day decided to assemble a band of the forest’s best archers and woodsmen before setting sail to fight far from the great forest in the Elves' Southlands campaigns. Though Oreon himself has not been seen or heard of in many centuries, his band and their descendants are known to still reside far away on the desert continent as mercenaries-for-hire. Such an existence is frowned upon, and for some time there has been whispers throughout the glades demanding these skillful Elven warriors return to fulfil their obligations to the forest. Such is the warriors code, however, that the only way to bring them back under Athel Loren’s influence would be to defeat them in honourable battle! 	bst/generic	rom_event_mission.png	false	false	Military		0	0	false	false	0.0000		true		false
wh2_dlc16_wef_confederation_mission_drycha	DEFEAT_N_ARMIES_OF_FACTION	For the Greater Good	The relationship between the Asrai and the Tree Spirits is highly complex and oft tumultuous. Cooperation was only ever possible due to a shared cause to be stewards of the forest; a task too often made all the easier by the alliance. Yet it is still desirable to some of the forest that the Wood Elves be decimated by war, most of all Drycha, the Briarmaven of Woe. As with all Tree Spirits, her loyalty is to the forest first and foremost, but she is also closely associated with Coeddil, the malevolent Ancient guilty of committing heinous crimes against the Asrai. To go to battle against the Wood Elves is to garner Drycha’s favour. For the purposes of strengthening the Weave, she could be a powerful ally indeed.	bst/generic	rom_event_mission.png	false	false	Military		0	0	false	false	0.0000		true		false
wh2_dlc16_wef_confederation_mission_laurelorn	DEFEAT_N_ARMIES_OF_FACTION	Cousins-in-Arms	Nestled in the northern reaches of the Empire is Loren’s sister-colony of Laurelorn, an enclave of Wood Elves that also endured the ages since Ulthuan withdrew its colonies from the Old World. The Empire states of Nordland and Middenland have historically both claimed Laurelorn Forest as their territory, but due to the fiercely isolationist Asrai who inhabit it, none have ever tried to enforce such claims. Lately the Empire has been the least of the Laurelorn Elves’ worries, as the Sea of Claws has seen increasingly frequent crossings by bloodthirsty Norscans whose sole purpose is war and destruction. Recent Northmen raids have seen them gain ground further south into Nordland, bringing Marauder bands closer to Laurelorn Forest. Minor skirmishes have already occurred, with Asrai blood needlessly spilt. For the good of the Weave, defeating the Norscans in battle and weakening their numbers may facilitate a friendship with the Laurelorn Elves and make them more sympathetic to your cause.	bst/generic	rom_event_mission.png	false	false	Military		0	0	false	false	0.0000		true		false
wh2_dlc16_wef_confederation_mission_sisters	DEFEAT_N_ARMIES_OF_FACTION	Pesticide	The Worldroots are important to all, for the fate of the Oak of Ages that sprouted them governs the fate of all forests, and some say the fate of the entire world. Few are more aware of this than the Sisters of Twilight, who use the ancient pathways by the will of their beloved Mage Queen Ariel. Lately it has been reported that the activities of the scheming, skittering Skaven have caused damage to the Worldroots. The ratmen gnaw at them not only making them untraversable in places, but also rendering all who use them vulnerable to Skaven ambushes. Bringing the Skaven to war and defeating them in battle will send a message that the defilement of the Oak of Ages’ sacred roots will not be tolerated. Furthermore, such actions will be seen favourably by the Sisters of Twilight, whose battle prowess and association with the powerful Mage Queen would make them very useful allies indeed.	bst/generic	rom_event_mission.png	false	false	Military		0	0	false	false	0.0000		true		false

Orion’s personality, however, is a melding not only of Kurnous, but also of the last Elf whose flesh was chosen to bear Kurnous’ spirit. The one selected by the Wild Riders on the eve of the last vernal equinox was a particularly combative individual, whose love for warmongering in the forest’s defence was said to exceed that of any his peers. With that in mind, it will take little more than some displays of martial prowess to garner the approval of the current manifestation of the King in the Woods, who could become a most valuable ally.	bst/generic	rom_event_mission.png	false	false	Military		0	0	false	false	0.0000		true		false
wh2_dlc16_wef_confederation_mission_torgovann	DEFEAT_N_ARMIES_OF_FACTION	The Enemy of Thy Enemy	The history between men and the folk of Athel Loren has always been a tumultuous one. Though the affairs of the earlier primitive man-tribes had been seen as folly by the Asrai, in more recent times the kingdom of Bretonnia to the west has grown in importance, acting as a buffer against the many threats the forest has had to face. Sometimes the ignorant men who live at the forest’s fringes take unpermitted sustenance from it, with such transgressions always met with the rage of a Wild Hunt that brings swift and merciless death. Lord Daith, ruler of Torgovann, has recently been vocal about the fact that the balance of power between Bretonnia and Athel Loren must be reinforced, for although these men can be considered friends, they are also inferiors and need to be reminded of that fact. A display of force against them will certainly show Lord Daith that you do not shirk from such responsibilities.	bst/generic	rom_event_mission.png	false	false	Military		0	0	false	false	0.0000		true		false

Lord Findol has reached out to you asking for your assistance – he would like you to bring war to the Greenskins so that their attentions may be elsewhere while Wydrioth’s defences are rejuvenated. Though he has little fear that any Greenskins attack would succeed even now, he prefers for his glades to be fully primed to inflict maximum bloodshed for the inevitable future attacks. 	bst/generic	rom_event_mission.png	false	false	Military		0	0	false	false	0.0000		true		false

For reasons forgotten in time, some of Athel Loren’s most ancient denizens left the great forest long ago to journey to the previously unexplored extremes of the life-giving Worldroots. Beyond the distant mountains to the east, in the lush jungles of southern Cathay, these spirits made their unlikely home. Yet today they are reduced to a small enclave beset on all sides by mischievous locals – the local Monkey people loyal to the Dragon Emperor.

If this is Ulrika Straghov, missing daughter of the deceased Ivan Straghov, who had warned Tzarina Katarin of the impending Chaos invasion, then further investigation is required. \n\nThe peasant believes the Countess and Ulrika have retreated to Nachthafen Castle. Entering the citadel will require you to masquerade as nobility, best achieved with the help of a gold-laden treasure vault.	emp/generic	rom_event_mission.png	false	false	Quest		0	0	true	false	0.0000		true		false

A single shard of one of these formations could be a powerful centrepiece for Ostankya’s crown, augmenting her influence over the spirits who facilitate her frightening spells.

The Trickster’s Staff, an ancient Tzeentchian artefact of little importance to the Old Worlders other than being worth a great deal of gold, sits securely in the vault of Dwarf merchants at Karak Azgaraz. By the Changeling’s machinations it had previously been in the possession of Empire merchants, only for him to promptly steal it back from them and plant it into the Dwarfs’ possession. With his deceitful whispers, the Empire merchants have been led to believe that the Dwarfs stole ‘their’ priceless artefact, and they now prepare to march on Azgaraz where bloodshed will surely ensue.

What they really need to see is the method proved in combat, against the Emperor’s foes, and as soon as is humanly possible! Only then will they be satisfied that a man of Bruckner's singular talents will be put to best use on the battlefield.	emp/generic	rom_event_mission.png	false	false	Quest		0	0	true	false	0.0000		true		false

This will be no easy task, however, as the garrison at Nuln is prepared for the coming incursion. From the Empire’s finest to the common smallfolk, all are ready to lay down their lives – nay, their very souls – in defence of the homeland, in a haze of blackpowder and artillery smoke.

His fearsome reputation has gathered many Greenskin tribes behind him in a Waaagh! which is now headed for the main route from the Badlands into the Empire: Black Fire Pass. Whilst messengers are dispatched to alert the Dwarfs, Karl Franz prepares to face the Greenskin onslaught, aware that this is the greatest test that he has yet faced in his reign as Emperor.	emp/generic	rom_event_mission.png	false	false	Quest	wh_main_qb_emp_karl_franz_ghal_maraz_stage_4_black_fire_pass	440	439	true	true	10.0000	341461509	true		false

wh3_main_ie_qb_wef_drycha_coeddil_unchained	FIGHT_SET_PIECE_BATTLE	Coeddil Unchained	Within Athel Loren, Drycha’s association with the vengeful Treeman Elder known as Coeddil is no secret. His great betrayal of the Asrai has not been forgotten, and the forests whisper that his wrath will never be subdued. He has roamed imprisoned in the Wildwood with his Dryad handmaidens for several centuries, while Drycha’s wargrove has determinedly carried out his malevolent decrees in the outside world. But the time of his liberation is finally at hand. Coeddil will have his freedom – Drycha needs only to topple two of the Waystones that form the fence around his forest prison, thus freeing the great Ancient once and for all!	wef/generic	rom_event_mission.png	false	false	Quest	wh2_dlc16_qb_wef_drycha_coeddil_unchained	348	404	true	true	10.0000	1214807884	true	Success!

Durthu had suspected the hand of the Necromancer Heinrich Kemmler, but instead his nefarious student is behind the Undead horde. The damp and pallid hallmarks of Kemmler are all over his protégé's work as he advances on the forest with his desiccated horde in tow. The forest must be protected, and Durthu will give no quarter in its defence.

The Elves speak of dark omens, and even Ariel herself feels the changing of the forest as surely as she feels the shifting of the season. Orion is incensed to find out that the relic is to be secretly given to the Cult of Pleasure in exchange for the Mark of Slaanesh. A Glade Lord, sworn to the defence of Athel Loren, plots against the forest and plans to usurp it! There is no time to waste, haste must be made to confront this errant and treacherous Lord before it is too late! The forest watches with fearful anticipation; the Night Glens seem to grow darker as the hour of battle approaches.	wef/generic	rom_event_mission.png	false	false	Quest	wh_dlc05_qb_wef_orion_the_cloak_of_isha_stage_3_the_night_glens	335	414	true	true	10.0000	2143928621	true		false

Reports reach the king that a herd of Beastmen slipped through the perimeter and defiled another Waystone before slinking back into the undergrowth. Orion and his scouts detect the foul and pestilent aura of Dark Magic at the site of the Beastman raid – an aura that could belong to only one Beastman that Orion knows of: Morghur. Rallying the Wood Elves to his side, he pushes onwards to find the enemy and sate his bloodlust.

Yet there are forces of darkness that would see this path curtailed all too quickly. Having infiltrated the Oak of Ages, Anath Raema – Goddess of the Savage Hunt – plans to supplant Ariel and ascend to an Athel Loren shaped by her malicious desires. Athel Loren is in uproar; fear sets in like a deep chill, which shatters into panic when a rebel force reveals itself, advancing on the Oak of Ages. Orion's final act must be to destroy this force and put Anath Raema's destructive desires to the sword once and for all.	wef/generic	rom_event_mission.png	false	false	Quest	wh_dlc05_qb_wef_orion_the_spear_of_kurnous_stage_3_the_oak_of_ages	335	398	true	true	10.0000	2143928621	true		false

To Naestra’s concern and Arahan’s seething anger, Ceithin-Har had not responded to their latest calls – the Dark Elves had captured it, but were then ambushed by some Beastmen who took the Dragon for themselves. The sisters know of one obvious place to look for the Children of Chaos; in the nearby forest enclave of Witchwood Hollow, their scouts had spotted their foul Herdstones – the only reliable evidence of a Beastmen presence.	wef/generic	rom_event_mission.png	false	false	Quest	wh2_dlc16_qb_wef_sisters_dragon	58	489	true	true	10.0000	2109289604	true	Success!

Out at sea, a storm gathers, the clouds rolling toward the shore. Under their cover, dark shapes move. The Dark Elves have come, eager to slaughter and fill their holds with slaves from amongst the seemingly helpless peasantry.

When the Gorger's nostrils flare and their famished eyes gleam red, Skrag knows that slaughter is close at hand, and he has learned to gauge the scale of the potential feast by the Gorgers' silent eagerness. On this day, the Gorgers have spent some time sniffing eagerly beyond the caverns, heading up out of the darkness and into the peaks with saliva stringing from their hideous teeth.

wh_dlc08_monster_hunt_0_stage_1	RAID_REGION	Monster Hunt: Frigustrex, Scion of the Cold-Void	With the appearance of giant, winged monsters, Chaos Frost Dragons are thought to be a type of Chaos-mutated Dragon that dwells in the underground passageways of the Old World’s coldest climes. Amongst the northern tribes there are tales of one such monstrous specimen called Frigustrex, Scion of the Cold-Void, which has terrorised the tundra for centuries. Witnesses say that when coming out of hibernation it emerges from the ground, in a heartbeat, to indiscriminately devour any unknowing passers-by that get too close to its territory, located somewhere at the frozen, northern end of Troll Country.\n\nRecently, The Tower of Khrakk and the surrounding areas north of Troll Country have been inexplicably blanketed by freakishly bad snow storms. Word also reaches you that entire tribes have disappeared from the region without a trace, reportedly perishing in the extreme weather.

wh_dlc08_monster_hunt_7_stage_3	MOVE_TO_REGION	Monster Hunt: The Abyssal Shrieker	After a short stint of raiding around Sylvanian lands, you come across an old manor known to be the former home of the Sylvanian family you seek. The house is lifeless – the line of nobility that used to live there had long ended, leaving only howling ghosts of the past that scatter into the shadows as you arrive. Searching every room, you come across a study with an old skeleton sat at a desk, a quill still in its hand. On the table is a leather-bound notebook containing a written history of the family who once lived there.\n\nAccording to the notebook, the former inhabitants of the house were once nobles of nearby Stirland, which was frequently haunted by The Abyssal Shrieker. The skeleton sat at the table was, in fact, a former Stirlander Lord, a renowned hunter who had once attempted to kill the exceptionally dangerous centuries-old monster himself. After a vicious battle, the great Lord failed to slay the beast and narrowly escaped with his life. Although he survived the encounter, he paid a terrible price for his defeat. The Terrorgheist absorbed almost all of his life-force and strength to make itself even more powerful, leaving the once-great hunter a sickly, weak individual, an affliction that infected his entire family and bloodline. Withered and disgraced, the noble and his kin exiled themselves to Sylvania where they eventually perished in shame.\n\nClearly, this pathetic Stirlander was nowhere near as great a hunter as you! He at least managed to record the location of his defeat, which you assume to be in the vicinity of the Abyssal Shrieker’s lair. All that remains to do is travel to Wurtbad to find it.	nor/generic	rom_event_mission.png	false	false	Quest		0	0	true	false	0.0000		true		false
wh_dlc08_monster_hunt_7_stage_3_mpc	MOVE_TO_REGION	Monster Hunt: The Abyssal Shrieker	Soaring above the eldritch plains of Sylvania there exists flying nocturnal beasts of rotten flesh and withered organs exposed to the night air – the gargantuan bat-like monsters known as Terrorgheists. One such beast known as the Abyssal Shrieker is more terrifying than all others,with a scream that is said to break the will of any man, and eyes like black holes that suck in all magical energies and light. It is an abominable creature spoken about only in nightmarish tales shrouded in myth, the fragments of truth of which are unknown to most.\n\nIn your hunt for the Abyssal Shrieker you obtained a leather-bound notebook containing a written history of the last individual who had attempted to kill it. This long-dead hunter was once a noble of Stirland, which for a time was frequently haunted by the mysterious centuries-old monster, so he set out to kill it himself. According to the notebook, the great Lord failed to slay the beast after a vicious battle, from which he only narrowly escaped with his life. Although he survived the encounter, he paid a terrible price for his defeat. The Terrorgheist absorbed almost all of his lifeforce and strength to make itself even more powerful, leaving the once-great hunter a sickly, weak individual, an affliction suffered by his entire family and bloodline.

Out of nowhere, a frighteningly large tide of Beastmen suddenly emerges from the thickets, gorily devouring the victims, ripping them piece from piece, limb from torso. Then, almost as quickly as they’d appeared, they were gone.
