wh2_dlc08_nor_confederate_generic	false	{{CcoCampaignEventDilemma:CharacterTargetName}}, leader of the {{CcoCampaignEventDilemma:FirstTargetFactionNameWithIcon}} tribe has been defeated; a once powerful warlord now reduced to obscurity beneath your might. For as you stand tall in victory he kneels at your side, hands in chains, his followers stood amongst yours, brought to a halt in anticipation of your next utterance. His men now see him as weak and unfit to lead any longer, this is a chance for you to take control of this faction's forces and land, as well as its followers' dubious loyalty.\n\nThough, while the allure of land may appear to make this choice a simple one, do not let the challenges that a larger empire creates escape you - perhaps simply killing this man and letting whatever is left of his faction fade into memory may be a more fitting end...

wh2_dlc08_nor_confederate_generic_no_execution	false	The leader of {{CcoCampaignEventDilemma:FirstTargetFactionNameWithIcon}}, {{CcoCampaignEventDilemma:CharacterTargetName}}, has been defeated. His followers look on in horror, their unwavering belief in their leader dashed in an instant, even this legend cannot deny your supremecy amongst all Norscans now. Surely now is the time to seize control, bring his domain into yours, take all that was once his. Or, you may free him... as an insult perhaps, an unending torment for this foe - the choice is yours.

Its crumbling edifices and dilapidated porticos are host to naught now but the desert winds. The agent scours the ruins, and eventually locates the entrance to a grand tomb, with Alcadizaar's name barely legible over the grand architrave. In front of the tomb lie the bodies of Lizardmen, entangled with mouldering remains. The blood and ichor is still wet: this skirmish was recent. Perhaps the battle still rages within?

wh2_dlc09_tmb_dilemma_crumbling_buildings	true	In cities as old as the deserts it is the natural order that even the finest buildings eventually crumble and fall.

wh2_dlc09_tmb_dilemma_liche_priest	true	Liche Priests should live only to serve their king's undying will.

wh2_dlc09_tmb_dilemma_scaly_sacrifice	true	Whilst traversing the jungles on the edge of the world, with a view to bringing them within our sphere of influence, our forces have encountered a village of tribal Lizardmen.

wh2_dlc09_tmb_dilemma_the_banisher	true	We have made a great discovery! During the course of our excavations, remains of the army that once served Alcadizaar the Conqueror, the last and maybe the greatest of all the Priest Kings of Nehekhara, have been unearthed.

wh2_dlc10_monster_hunt_10_stage_2	false	Dargoth is in the aftermath of some attack. The towers still burn even amongst the snow and ice, and the bodies of the recently-mauled litter the ground.

wh2_dlc10_qb_nor_monster_hunt_8_stage_2	false	This scheming Druchii trader has been surprisingly forthcoming thus far, but as you suspect, it is not long before he proposes a bargain. He is willing to hand over the extinguished Phoenix pinion, stating that it will prove useful on the hunt to come, and provide the location of the volcano in which the Mother of the Flame is reborn into this world.\n\nHowever, there is a cost; he has need of a favour regarding an unrelated matter. He wishes to divert you from your hunt - only temporarily - to kill one of his enemies. He claims he has bad credit with the assassins of his own race, so requires the murderous skills of your men. Once the death is certified he will hand over the pinion and the information you need to continue the hunt.	Monster Hunt: Mother of the Flame	messenger	false	Quest				false
wh2_dlc10_sword_of_khaine_lv1	false	You wield the power of Khaine's might. The sword strikes terror in all your enemies. On the battlefield you reap a mighty toll as foes fall before the blade with ease. Yet, nightmares torment your soul, and a sickness leeches into your lands... \n\nPerhaps it is wiser to relinquish such power? You will be weaker... feebler... but is it not a price worth paying to becalm your dreams?	The Sword Hungers	sword_of_khaine	false	Quest				false
wh2_dlc10_sword_of_khaine_lv2	false	Is the sword now controlling your decisions? Your power is absolute - a force to match the gods themselves - but your moods are permanently dark, your allies lose confidence, and your followers surely plot regicide. You reign over hollow lands and a desperate folk who now despise their sovereign!\n\nWill you give up this power to rule the world?	The Sword Festers	sword_of_khaine	false	Quest				false
wh2_dlc10_sword_of_khaine_lv3	false	Through battle, the sword grows ever stronger, while at home your lands fester and become more corrupted with the passing of time. You must choose whether to continue down this darkest of paths…	The Sword Hungers	sword_of_khaine	false	Quest				false
wh2_dlc10_sword_of_khaine_pick_or_not	false	The Sword of Khaine will always be drawn to the powerful.

The Sword Calls to You	sword_of_khaine	false	Quest				false
wh2_dlc11_cst_cylostra_the_bordeleaux_flabellum_stage_4	false	A self-obsessed singer needs a doting audience, and Cylostra is well aware that it is the Bretonnians who appreciate her talents the most. After all, it was a Bretonnian king who once favoured her above all other court singers, frequently inviting the diva to give private performances and serenade eminent guests at important stately banquets.\n\nOn the other hand, Cylostra is technically still well overdue for a high-profile performance before the High Elves of Ulthuan. Many years ago, when the Lamprey succumbed to a storm in the Eastern Straits of the Great Ocean, before Cylostra’s transformation, she was on an important diplomatic voyage to sing before the Phoenix King. A treaty of great import was reliant on his pleasure in her performance, for the Elves believe good art – music in particular – to be as valuable as gems and gold. It was an important engagement, so surely the High Elves will still be waiting for her?!\n\nTo find an audience, Cylostra could head east from the islands of Northern Yvresse towards Bretonnia, retracing the fateful voyage which led to her transforming into the eternally-vengeful spirit she has become. Alternatively, she could head towards the southern end of the Shifting Isles, where the High Elves' Old World shipping lanes are located, following them directly into the great Elven port of Lothern and, hopefully, to the Phoenix King himself...

wh2_dlc11_cst_dilemma_ancient_treasure	true	Although most entrepreneurial, our endeavours 'ave presented something of a dilemma. A large, jewel-adorned statue of sandstone has... found its way into our possession. It's far too large to take away 'ole, but its adornments would make quite the prize! It's also covered in glyphs indicating woe might befall any who mistreat it, but that's probably just flannel so less tenacious pirates leave it alone. Should we ignore the markings an' loot its jewels or be wary?	Ancient Treasure 	politics	false	Event	UI_CAM_EVENT_Dilemma			false
wh2_dlc11_cst_dilemma_camp_fortune	true	Ahoy there! We've come across an enemy encampment devoid of life an' littered with corpses. Half-devoured bodies are scattered about the clearing. The fallen dead were elite riflemen - surely one among 'em will be of use to us? Or perhaps we should seek out the creature that caused this massacre?	Fleshy Fortune	faction	false	Event	UI_CAM_EVENT_Dilemma			false
wh2_dlc11_cst_dilemma_great_golden_idol	true	Apparently, a great Lizardmen temple 'as been unearthed. Though most of it is dilapidated, a single statue stands at the centre of what was likely a ceremonial garden - it must be worth a fortune, but removing it will certainly cause the temple to collapse, which will surely draw somebody's ire. Should we take the idol an' ignore the consequences or be cautious not to attract too much attention - an' their cold, unforgiving bloodlust, our way?	Great Golden Idol 	politics	false	Event	UI_CAM_EVENT_Dilemma			false
wh2_dlc11_cst_dilemma_great_naval_battle	true	A major naval battle has ended, leavin' hundreds dead on each side. Death is no barrier to continued service, as well you know - those who fell in battle would make fine new recruits. If we make haste and 'ead off at full sail, the perished could be reanimated before they're lost to the ocean. We must decide if this boon is worth the toll it would take on our crew - should we make haste or ignore the battle?	A Great Engagement	celebration	false	Event	UI_CAM_EVENT_Dilemma			false
wh2_dlc11_cst_dilemma_grim_tidings	true	The tides seem uneasy an' force us off course. Could this be a warning from Manann? This would not be the first time he has guided us out of danger - should we continue our course or take heed?	Grim Tidings 	generic	false	Event	UI_CAM_EVENT_Dilemma			false
wh2_dlc11_cst_dilemma_ocean_of_opportunities	true	'Conversations' with several captured admirals 'ave brought information to light regarding several potential targets.

wh2_dlc11_cst_dilemma_pirate_haven	true	A rival band o'pirates 'ave requested access to some of our coves an' are willing for pay for it.

wh2_dlc11_cst_dilemma_plan_of_action	true	The night sky bleeds purple! The Wind of Shyish is strong, instilling the crew with new found vigour an' strength.

wh2_dlc11_cst_dilemma_rotten_wood	true	The harsh weather has caused severe damage to our timber reserves, makin' it difficult to repair any combat-damaged ships at sea.

wh2_dlc11_cst_dilemma_salvage_supplies	true	Our cargo hold has sprung a leak! Some of the booty has already been damaged an' our weapons an' armour are now at risk too!

wh2_dlc11_cst_dilemma_shipping_ledger	true	We've acquired a ledger covering much of the recently-raided area, filled with useful information 'bout shippin' routes an' cargo inventories. Two targets appear particularly valuable, yet strangely they're undefended. There is only time to pursue one of 'em though - which should we target?	Shipping Ledger 	messenger	false	Event	UI_CAM_EVENT_Dilemma			false
wh2_dlc11_cst_dilemma_shyish_wanes	true	Those purple Winds of Magic are strangely absent 'round these parts, makin' the bindings that tie our troops to this world an' our will tenuous at best! Should we wait for the winds to blow more favourably for us or press on regardless?	Shyish Wanes 	generic	false	Event	UI_CAM_EVENT_Dilemma			false
wh2_dlc11_cst_dilemma_supplies_adrift	true	The sight of wrecked ships is nothing new for a seasoned pirate, but this particular one 'eralds a welcome surprise! Packed to the keel with brand new weapons, armour an' gunpowder, this ship's cargo hold is several times the size of our own. However, some supplies will 'ave to be left behind. What should we loot from the ship?	Supplies Adrift 	army_morale_up	false	Event	UI_CAM_EVENT_Dilemma			false
wh2_dlc11_dilemma_neo_encounter_at_sea_1_a	false	The remains of a large sea beast are spotted floating in some nearby backwaters. The unidentified creature has been inexplicably ripped to pieces by an explosive force, its belly torn open and exposed. This mysterious find could prove bountiful, for who knows what devoured treasures might reside within its guts? An unidentified ship has also been spotted nearby – rival scavengers. Whoever they are, you are not one to share salvage with anyone!	Beast from the Deeps 	wh2_sea_encounters_2	false	Event	UI_CAM_EVENT_Dilemma			false
wh2_dlc11_dilemma_neo_encounter_at_sea_1_b	false	Your ocean scouts bring news that the bloated corpse of a massive sea monster has floated to the surface in some nearby straits. Although its carcass swells dangerously with noxious gases, you know that the belly of such a gargantuan monster can potentially yield numerous valuable treasures. A salvage mission may be a risky endeavour, however, as it is likely that other salvagers have also caught wind of the opportunity.	Monster of the Sea 	wh2_sea_encounters_1	false	Event	UI_CAM_EVENT_Dilemma			false
wh2_dlc11_dilemma_neo_encounter_at_sea_1_c	false	With a gush of putrid water, the bloated corpse of an ancient sea leviathan surfaces close by. You consider sending your crew to investigate what secrets the cadaver of the sea beast will bestow, but such an expedition is not without risk. When alive, these creatures are known to host parasites the size of wolves and even colonies of needle-toothed aquatic man-things. Even so, there may be valuables to be found within its stinking gut.

wh2_dlc11_dilemma_neo_encounter_at_sea_2_a	false	A convoy of trading ships carrying myriad precious goods across a nearby sea trade route have been brought low by the angry Sea-God, Stromfels, much to the chagrin of wealthy merchants and investors back at their homeports. Knowing that such a wreckage could be a highly profitable salvage opportunity, you sail towards the area but unsurprisingly, others have also caught wind of it. You could continue your approach, but this might end in a confrontation at sea…	The Lost Convoy 	wh2_sea_encounters_1	false	Event	UI_CAM_EVENT_Dilemma			false
wh2_dlc11_dilemma_neo_encounter_at_sea_2_b	false	The seabed is littered with the barnacle-clad hulls of ships that once set out to tame the oceans. Recently, rumours started circulating that one particularly notable wreckage had been spotted – a partially sunken ship that was rumoured to have been sailing back to Marienburg with a hold full of mysterious trinkets looted from across the Old World before suffering Stromfels’ ire. You know its location, but there’s always the chance that others have caught wind of these rumours too…	Treasure Down Below	wh2_sea_encounters_2	false	Event	UI_CAM_EVENT_Dilemma			false
wh2_dlc11_dilemma_neo_encounter_at_sea_2_c	false	From the crow's nest come shouts that broken masts can be seen piercing the ocean's surface. The lookout has spotted a sunken ship lying in the waters amongst some distant shoals. Located far from an inhabited shoreline or any known sailing routes, it has the markings of a pirate galleon. A mysterious sunken pirate ship in this location cannot be here without good reason, and perhaps that reason involves treasure!

wh2_dlc11_dilemma_neo_encounter_at_sea_3_a	false	You receive word of a wooden carcass of a ship that has been discovered strewn across a small, mysterious island. You are told that beyond the beach, gold and other trinkets can be found in abundance, surrounded by the long-dead crewmen who starved whilst waiting to be rescued. Some of your own crew whisper of curses which may be worth heeding, but such things rarely deter you when looted wealth and riches are involved…	The Cursed Islet	wh2_sea_encounters_2	false	Event	UI_CAM_EVENT_Dilemma			false
wh2_dlc11_dilemma_neo_encounter_at_sea_3_b	false	While on an ocean crossing, an island inexplicably rises out of the sea before you. As your fleet approaches, the crew hear an eerie but ensnaring song that carries over the turbulent surf; a tune that promises much, with lyrics singing of everything from the untold riches of Greasus Goldtooth to some of Nagash's secrets of Undeath. The verses foretell the attainment of great power and wealth - all you must do is order your vessel closer to shore… It is what the Syreens want…	The Island Song	wh2_sea_encounters_1	false	Event	UI_CAM_EVENT_Dilemma			false
wh2_dlc11_dilemma_neo_encounter_at_sea_3_c	false	As you make your way across the sea, the ocean mists suddenly part to reveal an island which, by all accounts, is unchartered even by the Great Mapwright himself. High spars of rock jut from sea, like spikes in a trap that has ensnared some prey. Indeed, a wrecked ship lies impaled on the small island's coastline; its crew seem to have moved into the interior along with any valuables that may have been onboard.

It seems that today may be your lucky day, as your lookout in the crow’s nest claims to have spotted one – a small island cave, next to which a black ship is moored. The ship belongs to an infamous fleet of Vampire pirates, and it appears that there are Zombie Deckhands transferring treasure chests onto the ship right now. It’s an opportunity for a big payday, but these Unliving sea-dogs certainly won’t give up their wealth too easily.	Hidden Pirate Cove	wh2_sea_encounters_1	false	Event	UI_CAM_EVENT_Dilemma			false

wh2_dlc13_emp_elector_politics_1	false	At a recent congregation of the Elector Counts there is a lengthy discussion about the separation of the religious cults from matters of Imperial policy.

On paper, you both stood to make prolific returns. Unfortunately, it turned out that the warehouses were inadvertently built directly above a giant rat nest – though it was not entirely clear from your business associates in Marienburg whether it was the rats or the nest that were giant. In the end, the entire site had to be levelled by a special demolition team brought in from Nuln.\n\nElector {{CcoCampaignEventDilemma:CharacterTargetName}} of {{CcoCampaignEventDilemma:FirstTargetFactionName}} is demanding a return on his investment, or at the very least his money back.

Attending were some of the more junior members of your personal retinue; fresh-faced recruits hand-picked for their warrior prowess but still young and impressionable men. During a night of rest and recuperation in {{CcoCampaignEventDilemma:FirstTargetFactionName}}’s capital, the men caused a drunken brawl that soon escalated into a minor riot. By dawn the next day the damage had spread across large portions of the city and included the desecration of some state monuments.\n\nThe behaviour of your men has caused  {{CcoCampaignEventDilemma:FirstTargetFactionName}} to look upon you extremely unfavourably.

wh2_dlc13_emp_elector_politics_13	false	You are approached by your sharpest political advisor, who has formulated a plan to increase your standing amongst the other Electors.

Friends in High Places	elector_politics	false	imperial_authority				false
wh2_dlc13_emp_elector_politics_14	false	One of your top advisors has suggested a way to increase your political standing within the Empire. Though you do not command all military activities in faraway lands personally, it is possible to have each state’s annals updated to attribute past military victories to your own involvement and frame yourself as an inspirational military leader. To achieve this you must contact your most trusted officials in each state and pull a lot of clandestine political strings – no small feat, but the fruits of such labour could be highly beneficial to you in the long run.	Roads to Renown	elector_politics	false	imperial_authority				false
wh2_dlc13_emp_elector_politics_15	false	There are few better ways to attain political standing than getting the common man on your side. One possible way of doing this is a grand tour of the states, in which you schedule a cavalcade to travel from capital to capital, where you will address the masses on any and all matters that might concern them. Needless to say, organising such a tour would involve calling in a lot of favours and pulling a lot of strings to achieve.	The Grand Tour	elector_politics	false	imperial_authority				false
wh2_dlc13_emp_elector_politics_16	false	In the Empire, political power is often connected to economic prosperity. There is perhaps no group or organisation that has a greater effect on economic prosperity across state borders than the Merchant’s Guild, the rumours being that many of the Electors themselves are on their payroll.\n\nUsing your gravitas, it may be possible for you to arrange 'favours' for the patrons of the Merchant’s Guild – such as loosened regulations or tax cuts, in addition to more personal furtherances – in return for their help in advancing your political standing, all at considerable cost of course.	Money is Power	elector_politics	false	imperial_authority				false
wh2_dlc13_emp_elector_politics_17	false	Ancient stone circles have been discovered in your state, remnants of the 'Old Faith', which in a prior age may have involved a primitive form of nature worship and blood sacrifices. There is evidence of recent activity at these sites, indicating there are those who still practice the dead religion.\n\nThe discovery of the monoliths and their recent use is angering the recognised Cults of the Empire, who always seek to subvert any elder meaning, dismissing it as backward, regressive, and a distraction from the true religions. In the modern day, the cults have considerable political gravitas within the Empire, so their opinion should perhaps not be overlooked. What action will you take?	Stones of the Ancients	elector_politics	false	imperial_authority				false
wh2_dlc13_emp_elector_politics_18	false	The Elector Counts have started discussions about new decrees that will reduce the amount of power they wield as a group across the whole Empire, while also increasing the autonomy of each of their states. It is essentially a step towards political decentralisation, with those who oppose the planned decrees even going as far as saying that it may be the beginning of the end of the great union of the Empire.\n\nPutting your political efforts into preventing the decrees may be the best thing to do for the Empire, but you must be tactful in how you proceed with addressing such a highly-charged and important issue.	Empire Means Conquest	elector_politics	false	imperial_authority				false
wh2_dlc13_emp_elector_politics_19	false	You have caught wind of vicious rumours being spread about you, accusing you of being a secret worshipper of Chaos. There is no indication as to the source of these lies, which of course have absolutely no grounds in reality and are clearly political in their motivations. Though these accusations are both baseless and outrageous, your reputation is already tarnished, since many believe there is no smoke without fire.\n\nShould you decide to take action, it will certainly take much time and effort to reverse the damage that these lies have done to your reputation.

wh2_dlc13_emp_elector_politics_20	false	It has come to the attention of another Elector that you were a target of bribery many years ago, having taken a vast payment from the Merchant Guild early in your tenure. In return, you lobbied against tightened regulations on their businesses, and were not the only head of state to ever have done so.\n\nThe Elector has proof of your acceptance of the Merchant Guild's gold. Although a minor blot on your past, he is threatening to reveal the evidence to the other Electors unless you give him considerable compensation. It may be ancient history, but the information will surely cause the other Electors to question your character and place amongst their number.

wh2_dlc13_emp_elector_politics_3	false	The Council of States is an important group of advisors that grew from the demands of running the Empire day-to-day - there are far too many for one man or woman to keep track of. Prominent family members or nobles of each state are frequently appointed as consultants on matters of Imperial law, finance, diplomacy and military matters, amongst other things.\n\nA seat on the council has become available and the states of {{CcoCampaignEventDilemma:FirstTargetFactionNameWithIcon}} and {{CcoCampaignEventDilemma:SecondTargetFactionNameWithIcon}} have both put forward candidates to fill it.

Though there was a ‘gentleman’s agreement’ to pay back the loan over a reasonable timeline, {{CcoCampaignEventDilemma:SecondTargetFactionName}} has now decided to call in the entire debt without warning or reason, demanding it be paid back in full immediately.\n\nThe two states have asked you to secretly help arbitrate this dispute without bringing it to attention of the other Electors.

wh2_dlc13_emp_elector_politics_5	false	A rash of highway banditry across the Empire has resulted in the introduction of new decrees to tighten security measures on all merchant routes that cross state borders. With new highway curfews, tougher patrols, and more frequent spot-checks, the increased restrictions on movement are strangling some states' businesses more than others.\n\nSeveral merchants in {{CcoCampaignEventDilemma:FirstTargetFactionNameWithIcon}} have recently gone out of business due to the new regulations, leading to fewer marketplaces and steadily-increasing poverty. It is in your power to pull a few strings and exclude the {{CcoCampaignEventDilemma:FirstTargetFactionName}} merchants from the new decrees, should you see fit to do so…	Stop & Search	elector_politics	false	imperial_authority				false

Such a seedy discovery would be an immense source of shame for both {{CcoCampaignEventDilemma:CharacterTargetName}} and indeed the entire state of {{CcoCampaignEventDilemma:FirstTargetFactionNameWithIcon}}.\n\nUsing your less-than-savoury connections, you could offer your help to {{CcoCampaignEventDilemma:CharacterTargetName}} in ‘silencing’ this harlot, which would certainly go a long way to increasing {{CcoCampaignEventDilemma:FirstTargetFactionName}}’s support for you.

Upon investigation, you manage to confirm with your connections in the Cult of Sigmar that this individual is indeed a state-issued Templar, albeit an extremely fanatical one.\n\nIt could be in your interest to help {{CcoCampaignEventDilemma:FirstTargetFactionName}} out of their woes by getting the Witch Hunter decommissioned.

It is a grand gesture for a head of state to extend such an invite to another, so naturally you accept.\n\nOn the day of the Wurstfest you are called away to lead an army against a minor uprising.

It is possible to magically dredge the stream of the Chaos taint which will keep it cleansed for a time.

But the Greenskins' threat to the forest also cannot be ignored. Forest Goblins are known to wantonly strip woodlands of trees upon which certain species of fungi grow, which they use for their foul spider-taming rituals.

Cothique Elves are hardy and weathered by the sea; they care little for the machinations of court, and so other, more 'refined' Elves gossip and giggle, not-quite out of sight. Yet the Cothiquian request is just, and their presentation courteous enough. How to deal with these other, disrespectful courtiers?	Court of the Sea	politics	false	Event				false
wh2_main_hef_intrigue_favour_of_the_phoenix	true	The courtiers align themselves before the court, all vying for royal attention and favour. Sycophantic, but necessary. The Everqueen cares not for such pandering, and so the dispensation of favour falls to the Phoenix King. The mages of Caledor, the horsemasters of Ellyrion, and the stalwart defenders of Cothique all prostrate themselves before him and he asks you whom he should favour.	Favour of the Phoenix	politics	false	Event				false
wh2_main_hef_intrigue_in_fighting	true	A dispute has developed between the nobles of Saphery and Yvresse, whom the Sapherian Elves call the 'ghosts of glory'. Although the petty, clandestine squabbles of lower houses are never usually a concern for the Phoenix King, the Sapherian Elves bristle with magical power, whilst Tor Yvresse is one of the most defensible, if dangerously ill-garrisoned, cities in Ulthuan. Harmony between these two houses is preferable but, if not possible, then someone, somewhere must be appeased.	In-Fighting	politics	false	Event				false
wh2_main_hef_intrigue_life_in_the_lagoon	true	Courtiers are often expected to spend large stretches of time at court, living and operating under the suffocating political intrigue of Lothern. The messengers of the Phoenix King are able to weave throughout the lodgings of the courtiers, disseminating information that helps or hinders them. Likewise, the king can make life comfortable for certain courtiers, or extremely unpleasant. All is at his whim...	Life in the Lagoon	politics	false	Event				false
wh2_main_hef_intrigue_retainer_of_power	true	The seneschal of the court controls the flow of information to and from the Phoenix King; he is, therefore, an important figure with great power. It is discovered that the seneschal has been choosing which information reaches the court, in order to maintain his power and reduce that of others. It is a shrewd tactic, but courtiers are only as smart as the secrets they hide. Once exposed, they are powerless.	Retainer of Power	politics	false	Event				false
wh2_main_hef_intrigue_signed_sealed_delivered	true	It has been discovered that the Keeper of the Seal, who controls the officiating of all documents with the mark of Lothern, has been abusing his position, using the seal on menial, personal documents to enhance his power and prestige. Exposing him would condemn the man, but perhaps there are ways this can be worked to the king's advantage...?	Signed, Sealed, Delivered	politics	false	Event				false
wh2_main_hef_intrigue_the_caledor_question	true	Whenever the envoys of Caledor are at court, fractious are the proceedings. They refuse to dip their flags to the Phoenix King, choosing instead to reference Caledor the Conqueror, who they say earned them the right to do as they please. Their arrogance is astounding, their insubordination infuriating, yet the Order of Vaul hail from Caledor, and their magical skills must never be underestimated, nor their loyalty imperilled.	The Caledor Question	politics	false	Event				false
wh2_main_hef_intrigue_the_court_of_many_kings	true	Every realm of Ulthuan sends nobles and representatives to the court of Lothern. Every realm is a kingdom in itself, and their leaders kings. They approach Lothern with such a mentality; how the Phoenix King treats these egos is vital to the development and stability of all of Ulthuan.	The Court of Many Kings	politics	false	Event				false
wh2_main_hef_intrigue_the_folly_of_youth	true	A young prince, impetuous and unknowing of the ways of court, has flown in the face of the order of precedence, speaking out against his elders publicly. Naturally, scandal has ensued. The Phoenix King is not required to wade into the hierarchical scuffles of the court, yet this prince shows promise - it would be unfortunate if he fell from grace due to his naive impropriety...	The Folly of Youth	politics	false	Event				false
wh2_main_hef_intrigue_the_hunt_and_the_hunter	true	The Phoenix King entertains the court to a great hunt, taken amongst the forests of Avelorn. The Elves of Chrace naturally excel at the sport, yet they are widely derided by the others for their prowess; the Master of the Hunt finds them especially odious. As one particularly mighty beast dives from the foliage, everyone lets loose their arrows. The beast is dead, a messenger reports, but it is uncertain who landed the killing blow. What do you recommend the Phoenix King tells them?	The Hunt & the Hunter	politics	false	Event				false
wh2_main_hef_intrigue_the_would_be_suitor	true	A noble prince of Ellyrion presents himself before the court, offering the courtship of his eldest, and certainly most beautiful, daughter. It is not forbidden for the Phoenix King, once married to the Everqueen, to take additional consorts, yet to do so would send an interesting message - one that could not be easily undone. All the same, it is clear this prince wishes to curry favour, yet the entire court observes the action of the Phoenix King; what he chooses to do may have repercussions.	The Would-Be Suitor	politics	false	Event				false
wh2_main_hef_intrigue_they_who_whisper	true	High Elves at court partake in many manipulations to achieve their ends. A common tool is to employ lesser Elves and servants as go-betweens; whispering little birds carrying messages. This is not unexpected, but when one of these messengers is intercepted or revealed, there can be no choice but to excoriate them, to save oneself. Having one such messenger revealed, how do you advise the Phoenix King responds?	They Who Whisper	politics	false	Event				false
wh2_main_hef_intrigue_wed_to_etiquette	true	The Phoenix King and Everqueen have received an invitation to the wedding of a court Noble. The king does not care much for them, but it would be impolite to not attend. Attending, however, requires that he bring a lavish gift for them. Whispers say that the engaged noble fancies himself a scholar, with a penchant for arcane and magical tomes. This would endear the Phoenix King to the betrothed-to-be, but there are perhaps other gifts that other guests would consider more impressive...	Wed to Etiquette	politics	false	Event				false
wh2_main_hef_intrigue_whispers_of_the_mourning_chorus	true	One of the princes of Tiranoc has perished whilst hunting. He was a forthright and well-liked fellow, yet known for his streaks of arrogance and foolhardiness. His death is a terrible loss to the Tiranoc nobility, who hold themselves rigid with the starch of past glory. The Phoenix King and Everqueen are, of course, invited to attend the burial rites, yet how they participate is discussed with much fervour amongst the court.	Whispers of the Mourning Chorus	politics	false	Event				false
wh2_main_hef_intrigue_you_can_dance	true	At a great masque to celebrate Vaul, the Maker, the floor is cleared so that the Phoenix King and Everqueen may dance together. The platitudes and graciousness from the guests are unending, but afterwards, many are left wondering who the Phoenix King will bestow the honour of the second dance upon? All eyes are watching, even those of the Everqueen.	You Can Dance	politics	false	Event				false
wh2_main_lzd_a_deadly_price	true	The mystical Slann Mage-Priests have devised a new ritual to increase the speed and agility of your mighty Saurus warriors on the battlefield. However, such advances always come at a price; some of those who fall may rise corrupted, and the Unliving are an abomination in the eyes of Old Ones.	(Un)deadly Price	messenger	false	Event				false
wh2_main_lzd_a_tainted_bounty	true	The delving of your industrious Skinks brings to light an ancient metal ore: could this substance have been brought to the world by the Old Ones themselves? When subjected to your advanced weaponsmithing process the ore makes highly-effective arrowheads and javelin points. However, once you start to use them some of your usually-hardy Saurus warriors fall ill, raising questions over its safety and even whether it was planted deliberately by the enemies of the Great Plan. Will you continue to use it?	A Tainted Bounty	land_defeat	false	Event				false
wh2_main_lzd_ancient_skills	true	Whilst studying some newly-recovered ancient plaques, your Skinks have rediscovered long-lost building techniques that will enable the construction of high pyramids and mighty ziggurats, the likes of which have not been seen within Lustrian temple-cities for ages past. Generally, such constructions rise slowly. Will you employ these new techniques or not?	Ancient Skills	diplomacy	false	Event				false
wh2_main_lzd_blood_sacrifice	true	Relations with a nearby settlement have deteriorated; their interpretation of the Great Plan may be at odds with the Old Ones' intentions. Your Slann Mage-Priests inform you of a new ritual to recharge the Geomantic Web, but the price is a sacrifice. Will you raid for captives and sacrifice them or leave your neighbours be, as time may yet prove your vision correct?	Blood Sacrifice	politics	false	Event				false
wh2_main_lzd_born_killers	true	This latest spawning of Saurus warriors appear to be far more belligerent than any you remember in recent times. Ferocity and resolve are called for when combating the foe, but your forces must also consider the Great Plan's higher purpose and not sacrifice themselves unduly. Will you embrace their vicious nature, or order retraining for a more balanced army?	Born Killers	army_morale_up	false	Event				false
wh2_main_lzd_charging_in	true	The fervour of your great Saurus warriors to combat agents of the Ancient Enemy is admirable, though it is starting to verge on fanaticism in some divisions, risking mistakes that could allow Chaos a greater purchase on Lustria's sacred jungles and temple-cities. Is such recklessness in keeping with the Great Plan or should the Slann Lord Mage-Priests instruct their underlings to instil caution in the ranks?	Charging In	army_morale_up	false	Event				false
wh2_main_lzd_knowledge_regained	true	The discovery of an ancient plaque has revealed lost knowledge which may increase the magical effectiveness of the great Slann Mage-Priests - not by much, but even a small Geomantic advantage may contribute to the advancement of the Great Plan. However, such things are expensive to research and so must be carefully considered. Will you commit your precious resources in furtherance of the Old Ones' designs, or is such a minimal gain not worth the cost?	Knowledge Regained	politics	false	Event				false
wh2_main_lzd_magic_for_blades	true	The mystical Slann Mage-Priests have devised a new ritual to increase the effectiveness of the blades wielded by your Saurus warriors on the battlefield. However, such advances always come at a price; the ritual will siphon much-needed power from the Geomantic Web, potentially putting the Great Plan under threat. Will you use it or not? 	Death Magic for Adepts	messenger	false	Event				false
wh2_main_lzd_new_blood	true	The signs are clear. The eternal war once again swerves in Lustria's direction; those that threaten to unmake the progress of the Great Plan gain power and prominence. Their designs must be countered. Do you wish to swell the warriors' ranks or bring forth a Saurus Hero to coldly annihilate the foe by fair means or foul?	New (Cold) Blood	generic	false	Event				false
wh2_main_lzd_one_shot	true	Your Slann Mage-Priests' researches reveal the whereabouts of a distant but accessible plaque recording a ritual, usable once, which will powerfully defend your greatest Saurus Scar-Veteran against agents of the Ancient Enemy. Is it worth sending an expedition especially to retrieve this one-off advantage?	One Shot	messenger	false	Event				false
wh2_main_lzd_out_or_in	true	Word comes of a new Norscan incursion; those foul servants of the Ancient Enemy, who revel in barbarism, have gained a foothold in Lustria and must be cast out! Their small coastal encampment could be easily eradicated, but many of your number are about to leave in search of a plaque of paramount import. As such, will you commit your forces to destroy the warmbloods or recover the relic and learn of the Old Ones' sacred intentions?	Servants of the Hound	blockaded	false	Event				false
wh2_main_lzd_reclaiming_the_lost_world	true	Your noble Slann Mage-Priests have devised a ritual that will give even ordinary Skinks increased immunity against some of the foul diseases lingering in territories overrun by the vile servants of the Great Horned Rat. However, they must still be defended against other threats in the abandoned temple-cities. Ground could be regained this way, though troops would have to be committed in the Skinks' defence.	Reclaiming the Lost World	politics	false	Event				false
wh2_main_lzd_seal_or_strike	true	Scouts have located a minor branch of the Druchii's Black Way emerging deep in your territory. Allowing allies of the Ancient Enemy so near your heartlands is unacceptable - the spread of Ruinous corruption cannot be allowed and risks the cornerstones of the Great Plan for all time! Should you close this potential enemy conduit or use it yourself, to harry the Dark Elves all the way back to Naggaroth?	Seal or Strike	messenger	false	Event				false
wh2_main_lzd_skilled_forces	true	Rumours reach you of forces loyal to your Ancient Enemy, the Ruinous Ones, obtaining a vile, corrupted foothold on Lustrian soil. However, you have recently instituted a new spawning programme, resulting many new Lizardmen of the wrong caste. Will you send your depleted armies out or institute a fresh spawning of deadly Saurus Warriors?	The Right Kind of Warrior	army_morale_up	false	Event				false
wh2_main_lzd_slann_selection	false	Enacting the powerful Rite of Awakening enables you to rouse one of the slumbering Slann from their restful contemplation.

wh2_main_lzd_the_greater_good	true	Skinks have uncovered a fell lode that has the stench of Clan Pestilens about it. Plague strikes down all who go near it; many useful artisan Skinks have already been lost, and more are at risk. Quarantine would stop this malady in its foul tracks and frustrate the designs of the insidious Plaguelords, but the trapped artisans would be lost to the Great Plan for now. Alternatively, you could evacuate your Skinks to safety, a course which keeps their numbers high but risks the pestilence spreading elsewhere.	The Greater Good	civilisation_down	false	Event				false
wh2_main_lzd_war_babies	true	Recent spawnings have favoured the artisan Skinks over the Saurus warrior-caste. Indeed, workers are important to the Great Plan, but the world is threatened from within also and must be defended. You must be prepared for whatever foul ploy the vile servants of the Ancient Enemy or the Great Horned Rat may unleash next!	War Babies	army_special_spawnings	false	Event				false
wh2_main_lzd_ways_and_means	true	The priests of Sotek, ever mindful of the need to press the Serpent God's cause on the field of battle, are uneasy at certain technological developments you believe to be part of the Great Plan; they counsel a more martial focus if the Old Ones' designs are to be realised and the Ancient Enemy kept at bay. Will you overrule their objections or hear their reasons?	Ways & Means	politics	false	Event				false
wh2_main_lzd_which_hero	true	The Great Plan must be brought to fruition; as many Skinks as possible must be spawned and set to work if the Old Ones' sacred goals are to be achieved.

Over some tankards of ale, Gotrek reveals to you that he is seeking the most heroic death possible. Felix suggests that he and Gotrek join your cause.

wh2_twa03_def_confederation_dilemma_karond_kar	false	With the markets of Karond Kar thronging with captives from your expeditions, your pre-eminence in the city is almost assured. Fearing your influence, the city's current Drachau is willing to offer a substantial bribe in return for your allegiance.

Any who opposed him were hung from the walls.\n\nThose that remained suffered at the hands of the savage Northmen.\n\nI found Kurnz's journal, hidden in his quarters.

Emblazoned on the Heraldry of Artois is the head of the monstrous boar Morthanok, symbol of Lord Folgar, the first Duke of Artois. A renowned hunter and lancer, Folgar's skills made him an invaluable Companion Knight who fought in several Great Battles alongside Gilles le Breton.

After slaying one such beast – the ancient Dragon Smearghus – he not only adopted its image on his Heraldry, but also wore its skin as part of his armour during all his Great Battles.

wh_dlc07_brt_confederation_bretonnia	false	King Leoncoeur's homeland of Couronne currently flies the heraldry of Bretonnia. The heritage of Couronne’s dukedom has ties to the original Grail Companions of Gilles the Uniter – their first duke was the heroic Carleond, saviour of the city and older brother of the most devoted Companion of them all, Thierulf of Lyonesse. As children, the two brothers were said to have miraculously slain a great lion together, which is why the heraldries of Lyonesse and Couronne – and hence, the heraldry of Bretonnia – display a lion’s image.

wh_dlc07_brt_confederation_carcassonne	false	It was Duke Lambard of Carcassonne, one of the famed Companions of Gilles the Uniter, who first adopted the image of the sword for his nation’s heraldry. Although Carcassonne was one of few Bretonnian provinces that did not see a Great Battle on its lands, Lambard rode out to fight victoriously in nine of them. The blade symbolises Carcassonne’s warrior-culture, attested by their centuries-old tradition of gifting every newborn son a freshly-forged sword, which they are made to touch as soon as they enter the world. It is then ornamentally placed above their cots until it can be wielded.	Heraldry of Carcassonne	politics	false	Event	UI_CAM_EVENT_Dilemma			false

He would later be one of the two Companions blessed by the Lady alongside Gilles himself, going on to fight victoriously in all twelve of the Great Battles with him.

It is said to be a likeness of his winged steed Glorfinial, lord and sire of all Royal pegasi, whom he befriended.

You have no choice but to melt down some of your stores of armour in order to make new blades to be bloodied. It must be either foot armour or arm guards.	Rare Metal	generic	false	Event				false
wh_dlc08_nor_sacrificial_altars	true	Your seers discover a pair of sacrificial altars, with strange and unknown runes on them. One altar is shaped like a ravenous beast. The other is in the form of a peculiar reptilian creature. Both are ancient, and the power in them has slumbered for years untold. Both need blood to awaken them - but which altar should your seers sacrifice slaves upon?	Sacrificial Altars	faction	false	Event				false
wh_dlc08_nor_shrine_or_shine	true	This weather is brutal even by northern standards. A vicious hailstorm blows up from nowhere; as it howls down upon your settlement you realise you have neither the time nor the materials to reinforce all of your buildings. Will you have your people try and save the shrines, or secure the loot piles?	Shrine or Shine	civilisation_down	false	Event				false
wh_dlc08_nor_surfeit_of_loot	true	While raiding across the sea your warriors discover rich pickings in a coastal village that was easily overcome. So rich, it turns out, that your ships, already heavy with earlier plunder, cannot carry all you wish to take. What should they load up with, and what should they leave behind?	A Surfeit of Loot	generic	false	Event				false
wh_dlc08_nor_the_dying_skald	true	Out in the remote depths of the icy wastes, your men find an aged skald, dying of wounds inflicted by wild beasts. He is the last of his people and before he goes to the Gods he wishes to pass on the knowledge of his ancestors, knowledge thought long lost, as his tribe have lived apart in the wilderness for many generations. But his time is short: what should your men ask him? 	The Dying Skald	civilisation_up	false	Event				false
wh_dlc08_qb_nor_monster_hunt_0_stage_2	false	The weather around the Tower of Khrakk is even more inhospitable than first thought. This unusually harsh climate is seemingly unbearable for most things to dwell in too long. The tundra is devoid of life, which may also be evidence that the mighty Frigustrex is nearby, usurping all other predators in the vicinity. Further reconnaissance is needed, but if you are to dwell in the extreme weather you require the help of those who are most at home in this harsh, snowy habitat. Who will you choose to serve you for this task?	Monster Hunt: Frigustrex, Scion of the Cold-Void	faction	false	Event				false
wh_dlc08_qb_nor_monster_hunt_2_stage_2	false	After days of searching, an enticing lead is uncovered. A slave languishing in a thrall pen up in the Goromadny Mountains is found repetitively mumbling stories about a ruthless and powerful Shaggoth with frightening power. Although clearly gone insane, it is plain to see that the pitiful man has experienced a terrible encounter in battle, missing an eye and an arm. But most importantly, he bears a tattoo known to be the mark of the fallen tribe.\n\nThe slave may be able to help you find your bounty, but his owner is asking an extortionate price for what is otherwise a useless, broken man. You could either pay the very dear price to buy the slave, or instead, pillage the entire enclave and take ownership of him and his owner by force!

wh_dlc08_qb_nor_monster_hunt_4_stage_2	false	As you pillage Bretonnian lands you find out that the herb collector you seek had been there, but had recently been taken hostage by some Goblins on a raid. These nasty Goblins are still nearby, but if you were to approach them with your entire army, the spineless green fools might do what they do best – scurry away and hide – and the hostage may be lost. A different approach is needed, and one which doesn’t involve violence. You can either send messengers to attempt to buy the man from the Goblins on your behalf, or you could try a sneaky snatch-and-grab rescue attempt. Which do you choose?

wh_main_azhag_the_slaughterer_azhags_ard_armour_stage_1	false	Azhag's Armour is alright. It's got spikes in the right places, the odd skull here and there and is decorated with the crusted blood of countless broken enemies. But it's missing something, and Azhag can't quite put his finger on what that is. He summons his Shamans to demand answers.	Azhag's 'Ard Armour	generic	false	Quest				false
wh_main_chs_the_eye_closes	false	The Eye of the Gods is closed, or so your Sorcerers tell you. Maybe it is for the best - a time to grow in power unfettered by the Gods' demands.

wh_main_dwf_a_grudge_too_far	true	The enemy has wronged us… but righting this grudge will cost us deeply, perhaps too deeply. Maybe, just this once, we should ignore the slight and focus on the grander objective?	A Grudge Too Far	generic	false	Event				false
wh_main_dwf_a_shameful_display	true	A close ally of ours, an influential Dawi sitting on several Guild councils, has shamed his family name with a craven act.

wh_main_dwf_besieged_khazid	true	A Dwarf trade caravan is ringed by Goblin Wolf raiders. A stalemate has developed, but the foe refuses to relent. Such a local affray should be dealt with by the local Lord, but your intervention could speed things up.	Caravan Raid	politics	false	Event				false
wh_main_dwf_empire_in_flames	true	The manlings of Sigmar come pleading to us once again. They have witnessed our devastating flame weapons and beg that we share the secrets to this technology, as we once did with black powder.	Empire in Flames	civilisation_up	false	Event				false
wh_main_dwf_ungrim_ironfist_slayer_crown_stage_3	false	The scout watching Sylvania's border reports a chance encounter with a terrified Sylvanian peasant who lay hidden and witnessed the passing of a hideous army of the dead. At its head rode two pale figures on dead horses, one in crimson armour, the other robed in black. The armoured figure slapped his mount's neck with a mailed fist and cursed in a voice as cold as death "Weeks of searching the mountain caves and still you have failed to find what I desire. If you are wrong about the locations to the northwest and we should find no dragon's corpse to serve me into death, I shall feast upon your soul". It seems that the Undead Lord is searching for new materials for use in his foul Necromancy. It would seem that the dead have found at least two possible locations for what they seek and are now moving to claim their vile prize. King Ungrim marches from his hall, shouting for the throng to be assembled. In the meantime he must decide which of the Undead hordes his scout should track.

The Master Brewer recounts a tale of woe and fell magicks that has all the hallmarks of the Ruinous Powers. It seems a Chaos Lord is loose in the Reikwald. The urk is performing fell rituals that corrupt Beastmen tribes to his will and saturate the Cloven Ones in Dark Magic, making them an even greater threat than normal.
