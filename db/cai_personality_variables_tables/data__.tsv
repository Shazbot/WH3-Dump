ai_military_generator_size_penalty_multiplier	 0.12	(In-game) Multiplier for the military force size penalty. The higher the more penalty is applied. Setting it to higher will make the AI prefer to recurit less units it any one instance. Can be used to increase quality of units, but setting it too high will lead to the AI failing to max out the size of its forces.
ai_threat_score_attitude_multiplier_max	3	(In-game) The max value for the attitude multiplier used in common threat in diplomacy calculations. The calculation for overall threat is base_score * attitude_multiplier * direct_actions_mulitplier * proximity_multiplier * personality_multiplier_player. This means setting any multiplier to zero will lead to threat being zero.
ai_threat_score_attitude_multiplier_min	0.1	(In-game)The min value for the attitude multiplier used in common threat in diplomacy calculations. The calculation for overall threat is base_score * attitude_multiplier * direct_actions_mulitplier * proximity_multiplier * personality_multiplier_player. This means setting any multiplier to zero will lead to threat being zero.
ai_threat_score_attitude_threshold_max	150	(In-game) The attitude value which will give the *minimum* attitude value multiplier used in common threat in diplomacy calculations. The calculation for overall threat is base_score * attitude_multiplier * direct_actions_mulitplier * proximity_multiplier * personality_multiplier_player. This means setting any multiplier to zero will lead to threat being zero.
ai_threat_score_attitude_threshold_min	-150	(In-game) The attitude value which will give the *maximum* attitude value multiplier used in common threat in diplomacy calculations. The calculation for overall threat is base_score * attitude_multiplier * direct_actions_mulitplier * proximity_multiplier * personality_multiplier_player. This means setting any multiplier to zero will lead to threat being zero.
ai_threat_score_direct_actions_mult_max	1	(In-game) The max value for the direct actions multiplier used in common threat in diplomacy calculations. The calculation for overall threat is base_score * attitude_multiplier * direct_actions_mulitplier * proximity_multiplier * personality_multiplier_player. This means setting any multiplier to zero will lead to threat being zero.
ai_threat_score_direct_actions_mult_min	0.5	(In-game) The min value for the direct actions multiplier used in common threat in diplomacy calculations. The calculation for overall threat is base_score * attitude_multiplier * direct_actions_mulitplier * proximity_multiplier * personality_multiplier_player. This means setting any multiplier to zero will lead to threat being zero.
ai_threat_score_personality_multiplier_player	1.0	(In-game) An additional value that the players threat score is multiplied by (effectively set at 1 when calculating for all non player factions threat scores) in common threat in diplomacy calculations. The calculation for overall threat is base_score * attitude_multiplier * direct_actions_mulitplier * proximity_multiplier * personality_multiplier_player. This means setting any multiplier to zero will lead to threat being zero.
ai_threat_score_proximity_multiplier_max	1	(In-game) The max value for the proximity multiplier used in common threat in diplomacy calculations. The calculation for overall threat is base_score * attitude_multiplier * direct_actions_mulitplier * proximity_multiplier * personality_multiplier_player. This means setting any multiplier to zero will lead to threat being zero.
ai_threat_score_proximity_multiplier_min	0.25	(In-game) The min value for the proximity multiplier used in common threat in diplomacy calculations.The calculation for overall threat is base_score * attitude_multiplier * direct_actions_mulitplier * proximity_multiplier * personality_multiplier_player. This means setting any multiplier to zero will lead to threat being zero.
allied_recruitment_favour_max	50	(In-game) When performing allied recruitment, we must have more than X favour points with the ally, where X is a random number between CAI_VARIABLE_ALLIED_RECRUITMENT_FAVOUR_MIN and this.
allied_recruitment_favour_min	25	(In-game) When performing allied recruitment, we must have more than X favour points with the ally, where X is a random number between this and CAI_VARIABLE_ALLIED_RECRUITMENT_FAVOUR_MAX.
balanced_enemy_strength_baseline	0.1	(In-game) In some cases, when doing strategic context analysis, we will scale the enemy strength by our proportion of the total strength of all factions at war with that enemy. This is the lower bound of that scaling. Value between 0 and 1.
brew_selection_probability	0.5	(In-game) Where brew application is reasonable, probability it will be applied.
brew_selection_strength_ratio_lower_bound	0.3	(In-game) Lower bound on proportion of attacker/defender ratio where brews may be applied.
brew_selection_strength_ratio_upper_bound	0.7	(In-game) Upper bound on proportion of attacker/defender ratio where brews may be applied.
caravans_cargo_increments	100	(In-game) Cargo value will be rounded down to this increment: i.e 100 means that the AI can send cargos with a value of 100, 200, 300...
caravans_maximum_cargo	2000	(In-game) The maximum cargo value that the AI will send a caravan with.
caravans_maximum_cargo_as_proportion_of_treasury	0.5	(In-game) The maximum proportion of their treasury that the AI will send a caravan with.
caravans_minimum_cargo	200	(In-game) The minimum cargo value that the AI will send a caravan with.
coordinator_major_faction_strength_bonus	1.25	(In-game) Multiplier for strength of AI major factions when against AI minor factions
coordinator_player_loss_multiplier	1	(In-game) Multiplier for score contribution of player's losses.
coordinator_player_strength_multiplier	1	(In-game) Multiplier for strength all AI factions apply to player factions forces.
diplomacy_deal_evaluation_long_distance_threshold_max	1	(In-game) At this proportion of the distance that's specified by CAI_VARIABLE_DIPLOMACY_DISTANCE_GOAL_PRIORITY_MODIFIER, we apply the maximum amount of deal evaluation penalty (long_distance_penalty_max)
diplomacy_deal_evaluation_long_distance_threshold_min	0.05	(In-game) Starting from this proportion of the distance that's specified by CAI_VARIABLE_DIPLOMACY_DISTANCE_GOAL_PRIORITY_MODIFIER, we start to apply deal evaluation penalties (long_distance_penalty_min)
diplomacy_distance_goal_priority_modifier	0.25	(In-game) Distance-based modifier for diplomatic goals. The distance is equal to the number of action points it takes to get between the two regions in the map which are furthest away from each over as the crow flies. In IE this is (as of CHD) roughly equal to 132 000. This number is multiplied by the value for this variable to get the maximum distance for AI diplomacy calculations 
max_goal_evaluations	100	(In-game) Maximum number of goals evaluated by this faction per round.
strategic_threat_analysis_maintain_new_main_threat_minimum_number_of_rounds_threshold	5	(In-game) Used in faction strategic threat analysis for specifying how long a 'main threat' should be retained for at a minimum (in number of rounds)
trespassing_warning_compliance_duration	10	(In-game) How many rounds until trespassing_warning_compliance_value hits zero. 
trespassing_warning_compliance_value	50	(In-game) Modifier for trespass analysis scoring when we've agreed to get off of a faction's land. Converges towards 0, in trespassing_warning_compliance_duration rounds.
