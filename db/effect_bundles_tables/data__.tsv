wh3_main_incident_all_corruption_khorne	An unnatural aggression takes hold of the populace; a seething frustration that explodes at the slightest provocation. Even the most placid soul becomes as quick to anger as a rabid dog. Soon enough, the fighting begins. The streets are littered with the dazed and beaten, and the gutters run red with blood.	The Age of Rage	region	1	corruption_khorne.png	true	false	true
wh3_main_incident_all_corruption_nurgle	Exploring too deep into an ancient cave system, a forager unwittingly brings back with them a hitherto unknown and devastating disease – one which now spreads like wildfire throughout the populace.

wh3_main_incident_all_corruption_slaanesh	A travelling clothier sets up her stall, offering garments tailored so masterfully that they are like a second skin. All who don her garments become consumed by self-obsession, forever admiring their own reflections and refusing all other duties. Undeterred, countless more queue out the door.	Haute Couture	region	1	corruption_slaanesh.png	true	false	true
wh3_main_incident_all_corruption_tzeentch	"Chen" – single word, shredding sanity wherever it is spoken. They say a large, black bird was the first to utter it, and now all who hear it soon say nothing else, laughing hysterically as they bark into the ears of those around them. "Chen! Chen! Chen! CHEN!"	Quoth the Raven	region	1	corruption_tzeentch.png	true	false	true
wh3_main_incident_cth_4	The people report sightings of flickering figures in their homes, chanting in oddly familiar voices. One is even certain she saw the faces of her long-dead grandparents. Before these reports can be corroborated, the ancestor spirits – if that is what they are – disappear. In their wake, the land knows harmony.

wh3_main_incident_cth_5	There is a shudder from the Celestial Palace, and the sound of straining metal, as the Wu Xing Compass works its sorcery.

wh3_main_incident_cth_9	Disaster strikes, as a sudden storm blows a colossal Sky-Junk into a mountainside. The impact shakes loose a legion of long-lost Terracotta Sentinels, stationed immobile since some ancient campaign. Fortunately, many can be restored, while those demolished in the fall can be used to repair others of their kind.	Rain of Giants	faction	1	treasury.png	true	false	true
wh3_main_incident_dae_10	Determined to please Khorne further, his servants elect to brand their own hides with His flaming icon. Their screams are beyond horrifying, and the caustic stench of burning Daemon flesh is unforgettable, but the rite plunges them into an enduring hunger for slaughter, requiring no other sustenance.	Blood-Brothers	faction	1	treasury.png	true	false	true
wh3_main_incident_dae_11	Nurgle's Rot is a slow death sentence for mortals, but amongst the Urfather's faithful it is a source of strength. The Fly Lord's putrescent devotees are thus delighted by their discovery of a new strain of this divine contagion, one that numbs their senses as it ravages their flesh.	Rot of Splendour	faction	1	treasury.png	true	false	true
wh3_main_incident_dae_12	Somewhere far beyond, Slaanesh knows the ecstasy of satisfaction. Afterwards, as the Perfect Prince slumbers in His forbidden boudoir, the howling sweetness of His dreams touches each and every one of His servants. Sated, they need nothing else for now.	A Thirst Slaked	faction	1	treasury.png	true	false	true
wh3_main_incident_dae_13	A strange calm comes over those who pledge themselves to the Raven. They refuse all food and rest, and work tirelessly. When pressed on the matter, they all chant the same chant: "We want for nothing today, for great Tzeentch has shown us the rewards we will know tomorrow."	The Changer's Promise	faction	1	treasury.png	true	false	true
wh3_main_incident_dae_9	The land itself erupts in obsidian spines from far below, some coated in crimson blood, some in noxious bile, others exuding a bewitching, bittersweet fragrance, and others still bearing a shimmering halo of eldritch flame. The Ruinous Powers lay claim to this realm...	World of Darkness	region	1	corruption_chaos.png	true	false	true
wh3_main_incident_kho_5	A Norscan Shaman reports a vision of a far-off kingdom razed to ash, its every inhabitant slaughtered, of nothing left but a mountain of skulls. Though none know where this land is, the joyous news of Khorne's distant triumph means countless Daemons jockey for the opportunity to achieve similar here.	Copycat Killers	faction	1	treasury.png	true	false	true
wh3_main_incident_kho_6	No realm can be truly considered cleansed of life by merely scourging its surface. In sewers and caverns the Skaven lurk, always. Eight thousand barrels of boiling blood solve the problem neatly. As countless vermin are roasted alive in their foul nests, the land itself becomes a monument to Khorne.	Down the Drain	region	1	corruption_khorne.png	true	false	true
wh3_main_incident_kho_7	As one, unbidden, dozens of Daemons begin to chant. "Blood for the Blood God! Skulls for the Skull Throne! BLOOD FOR THE BLOOD GOD! SKULLS FOR THE SKULL THRONE!" They continue this tirelessly for days, then suddenly all drop dead. There is a laugh like thunder, and the skies blacken.	The Song of Blood	faction	1	corruption_khorne.png	true	false	true
wh3_main_incident_kho_8	Tired of waiting for the next battle, a troop of Bloodletters storm out of camp. They maraud across the land, slaughtering without discretion, their rage growing with each kill. Ultimately, they turn upon each other. Though none survive, word of their brutal deeds inspires others to similar feats of carnage.	Setting an Example	force	1	melee.png	true	false	true
wh3_main_incident_kho_9	You stumble upon an Ogre camp. A Butcher escapes the slaughter by promising untold power. He slices and stews the entrails of his fallen kin, creating a foaming red broth which causes hide to harden and muscle to swell. Though useful, all sorcery offends Khorne, and so the Butcher is slain.	Meat Magic	character	1	melee_character.png	true	false	true
wh3_main_incident_ksl_1	Madame Valentina, a singularly fearsome Ice Witch, retired years ago. But she has spent the time since tutting at falling standards, at Ice Maidens who barely know Frost Blade from Crystal Cloak, and she can stand no more. When she raps furiously upon the Ice Court’s doors, none dare refuse her.	Babushka, Babushka	faction	1	turns.png	true	false	true
wh3_main_incident_ksl_10	Your Lancers bring you the bones of a long-lost Tzar, discovered while patrolling the oblast. Into a reliquary box they go, holy relics of an ancient war to defend Kislev’s vast borders. Inspired by this proof that their rulers too sacrifice everything for the Motherland, your legions take heart.	One of Us	faction	1	morale.png	true	false	true
wh3_main_incident_ksl_2	Officially, the Ice Court only accepts young women of noble lineage, for only they deserve its timeless wisdom. Exceptions are sometimes made, though none may talk of it. When a farmer beseeches the Court, offering a thousand saddlebags of blood-stained gold, his daughter is accepted without question.	State Scholarship	faction	1	treasury.png	true	false	true
wh3_main_incident_ksl_4	Many believe that the Motherland is alive, and loves her people as they love her. When disease claims the lives of every man, woman and child in five stanitsas, the icy wind takes on a new timbre, one that sounds like a sorrowful howl. The land will surely make amends.	Mother Earth	faction	1	devotion_bundle.png	true	false	true
wh3_main_incident_ksl_7	The Patriarchs descend upon every home, rooting through drawers and overturning bookshelves in search of any hint of heresy. Countless Kislevites are dragged from their beds and executed. Who can say how many were innocent? Nevertheless, purity – or, at least, terrified obedience – is restored.	Committee for State Security	region	1	corruption.png	true	false	true
wh3_main_incident_ksl_9	Feeding War Bears is an expensive business – the beasts consume their own body weight in meat daily. The discovery of an enormous Slaaneshi cult hiding in Erenegrad's sewers is thus an occasion for celebration rather than dismay. Blasphemy is duly purged, and the bears sleep well.	Hungrier than the Average Bear	faction	1	treasury.png	true	false	true
wh3_main_incident_nur_10	Many equate Nurgle with death, but this is to misunderstand His intent. He desires rebirth, so that more death may follow. So it is that He raises the bones of the long-dead, and from them sprouts bilious flesh. Nurgle's newest children strike up their buzzing drone, and the cycle begins anew.	The Circle of Life	province	1	growth.png	true	false	true
wh3_main_incident_nur_3	Morrslieb grows full, casting its sickly green light across the land. The Fly Lord’s children rejoice, for contagion thrives under the Chaos moon’s cold shadow. The rotted legion erupts in fresh sores and, in horrifying unison, coughs a constant cough, spraying fountains of plague-ridden spittle with every phlegmy bark.	The Green Moon	force	1	plague.png	true	false	true
wh3_main_incident_nur_4	The droning of Nurgle's Plaguebearers is feared across the land, for all know it heralds lingering, fever-wracked death. However, an unusually enterprising Tallyband drift from their usual monotone and chant their chilling dirge in a hitherto-unheard frequency – one which immediately loosens the bowels of all for miles around.	The Brown Note	force	1	public_order.png	true	false	true
wh3_main_incident_nur_5	An uncommonly bloated Plague Toad is drawn helplessly to the befoulment of a nearby sewer, but cannot squeeze itself through the entry grate. With a final terrible lunge, it wrenches itself across - tearing its vast belly open in the process. The countless black maggots within surge into the local water supply.	Something in the Water	region	1	corruption_nurgle.png	true	false	true
wh3_main_incident_nur_6	The earth of every town, every village, every field and every forest simultaneously sprouts a single Nurgling. The tiny Daemons stand stock-still, their rictus grins never changing. On the seventh day of this, all suddenly burst, releasing an immense cloud of flies that quickly disperse, turning the very skies yellow.	The Fly Lord	faction	1	corruption_nurgle.png	true	false	true
wh3_main_incident_nur_7	Your plague-scientists have been busy. From their squalid laboratories they birth a brand new contagion, one they proudly dub 'Raven Rot'. Remorselessly, the pox ravages eldritch feathers and chews at ectoplasmic flesh. Truly, it is a beautiful disease, one that silences the arrogant bluster of the Changer’s iridescent slaves.	Bird-Flu	faction	1	morale.png	true	false	true
wh3_main_incident_nur_8	Your pock-marked children pick idly at their own scabs as they await the next battle. After a time, they fall into a strange and silent trance, and continue picking until their entire hides hang off them in grisly ribbons. As their ruined flesh knits, it hardens into thick, body-wide callouses.	Chicken-Scratch	force	1	armour.png	true	false	true
wh3_main_incident_nur_9	A storm darkens the skies, but there is no lightning – instead, there comes a hail of man-sized, pus-filled seeds. As they implant themselves in the earth, it becomes iron-hard and sprouts vast and pungent fungal foundations. Praise be to Nurgle, for He shares His garden's bounty!

wh3_main_incident_ogr_2	Those farmsteads unfortunate enough to be proximate to your tribes have long accepted that the price of their survival is eye-wateringly high. The great day has rolled around once again, and when your followers eventually stir from their grease-stained beds, they are presented with veritable mountains of slaughtered lambs and calves.	Lambing Season	faction	1	meat_bundle.png	true	false	true
wh3_main_incident_ogr_3	Your henchmen drag an unusually lucid Gorger before you. Unlike its solitude-maddened kin, the elephantine, sinewy horror will obey basic commands. This proves particularly useful during contract negotiations. A mere snap of the fingers will see the other party’s head torn from their shoulders – a superior rate is thus guaranteed.	The Negotiator	faction	1	treasury.png	true	false	true
wh3_main_incident_ogr_5	One of your Butchers laces his latest dish with oddly-glowing mushrooms from the deepest caves. The tribe who consumes it soon enters a state of euphoria. As one, they begin to dance, their thunderous footsteps toppling trees and shaking boulders from mountains. Even the very shadows retreat from the cacophony.	Greasy is the Word	region	1	corruption.png	true	false	true
wh3_main_incident_ogr_6	An enterprising Slaughtermaster hits upon the idea of fashioning crude, oversized slip-on noses and ears from leftover scraps of hide. Desirous of these absurd prosthetics, countless Gnoblars flock to your cause – for in their abhorrent society there is no greater sign of station than a bulbous snout and mammoth lugs.	Gnoblar Prosthetics	faction	1	treasury.png	true	false	true
wh3_main_incident_ogr_7	A wandering Hunter shares his tall tales with the tribe. In one, he claims to have trapped and eaten a dragon, and that the taste was beyond compare - like the most succulent chicken marinated in the finest spices. The tribe is instantly decided: they must experience this singular flavour themselves.	Scoville Scale	faction	1	morale.png	true	false	true
wh3_main_incident_ogr_8	Though Gnoblars are highly irritating creatures, the larger ones have occasional moments of brilliance. One of your favourites takes it upon itself to spread a rumour that consuming the gizzard of a Daemon will make one's gut double in size. To say the tribe is motivated would be an understatement.	Ruinous Rumours	faction	1	morale.png	true	false	true
wh3_main_incident_sla_10	Mutation is usually the bailiwick of Tzeentch, but it has its uses for Slaanesh. There is a moan from beyond, and your followers sprout gossamer, lavender tendrils. Wherever they tread, their new fronds help themselves to flesh, caressing and lashing, clasping and tantalising, bringing shivers of ecstasy to all around.	Fifty Shades of Purple	force	1	corruption_slaanesh.png	true	false	true
wh3_main_incident_sla_4	In dreams, the Perfect Prince touches every mind, granting fevered visions of their darkest desires. The strongest are buoyed by these indescribable peaks of sensation, awakening fulfilled like never before, but the weakest cannot endure. Their spent, desiccated forms crumble, and the very land feeds upon their tormented souls.	Sandman	region	1	corruption_slaanesh.png	true	false	true
wh3_main_incident_sla_5	A euphoric compulsion takes hold of every soul in the land, and they each proudly send you a missive containing their darkest, guiltiest secret. When reason returns to them, they swear unwavering subservience – in exchange for a promise that their shameful truths shall never be revealed.	Truth Bomb	region	1	public_order.png	true	false	true
wh3_main_incident_sla_6	Your Fiends learn to howl in a hypnotic harmony that implants an overwhelming suggestion into the minds of all around. Across the land, hands claw feverishly at belt buckles and blouse buttons, walls shake and beds break. Calls for order fall upon deaf ears, for all are lost in bliss.	Don't Come A-Knockin'	force	1	public_order.png	true	false	true
wh3_main_incident_sla_8	In a moment of indulgence, you grant one of your followers the honour of becoming tonight's concubine. Basking in the afterglow of pleasure and suffering beyond all mortal imagining, they henceforth carry themselves with unshakeable confidence, convinced of their own greatness.	The Morning After	character	1	agent.png	true	false	true
wh3_main_incident_sla_9	Your perfumiers have designed a new scent to confound the senses, one which causes all those who inhale it to helplessly bellow their deepest desires aloud. By dousing themselves in this delicious fragrance, your Daemonettes are granted all the insight they need to bewitch their weak-minded foes.	Too Much Information	faction	1	military_spending.png	true	false	true
wh3_main_incident_tze_10	As one, your followers begin to skip in and out of existence. One second they are there, one second they are not, then they reappear, and so forth. With each reappearance, they sport fresh new feathers, resplendent in blue and gold, and speak in a different tongue.	Summoned Before Tzeentch	force	1	experience.png	true	false	true
wh3_main_incident_tze_3	A swarm of shimmering blue-pink sigils appears suddenly upon every available surface, each one contradicting the last. Some who gaze upon them strike up uncontrolled screaming, while others chant in a tongue unrecognisable to even Tzeentch's most trusted servants. It is then that the sigils begin to whisper.	Whispering Walls	region	1	corruption_tzeentch.png	true	false	true
wh3_main_incident_tze_5	An eerie freneticism falls upon your scribes as they study their tomes, refusing rest and sustenance. As they read, their craniums swell and swell, until their engorged brains spill from their skulls – yet still they read. On the ninth morning, their vast minds consume the rest of their malnourished forms.	Brain Fog	faction	1	technology.png	true	false	true
wh3_main_incident_tze_6	Wealth is a dull necessity in the mortal realm, but there are ways to make its acquisition more entertaining. Deep in His Impossible Fortress, the Changer inscribes a flaming rune into the very air. Far away, a single ear of each of your followers is transmuted into solid gold.	Golden Ear	region	1	income.png	true	false	true
wh3_main_incident_tze_7	Those of your followers lucid enough to care report strange behaviour from their own shadows. The shades appear to move of their own accord, never quite mirroring the actions of their casters. Soon enough they tear themselves free and stand upright – unnerving yet loyal two-dimensional replicas of those who bore them.	Me, Myself & I	region	1	growth.png	true	false	true
wh3_main_incident_tze_8	Without warning, nine city-sized blue and yellow runes manifest in the skies. The moment they disappear, the same rune carves itself into the left cheek of all who witnessed it.
