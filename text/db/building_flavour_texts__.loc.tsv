building_flavour_texts_flavour_wh3_dlc25_special_black_rose_chapterhouse	Originally founded during the time of the Three Emperors as the bodyguard of the would-be Emperor, the Elector Count of Stirland, the Order of the Black Rose have a long and chequered history, famously changing allegiance no less than three times in the fragmented wars during which they were founded. Though they still carry the emblem of their progenitor, the Orderâ€™s loyalties shift like sand, for their Grand Masters have ever sought to cultivate political power from the military might at their command. For instance, at the Battle of the Talabec they served as the heavy cavalry bodyguard of Ottilia of Talabecland, and were justly famed throughout the Empire. Recruiting only the very best warriors, the Order are paid and equipped at the state's expense. At one time, they numbered just one hundred men, and thus it was a great honour to be chosen for membership. Each Knight brings his own military expertise and knowledge with him and teaches his compatriots, making the Order a uniquely well-rounded fighting force.	false

building_flavour_texts_flavour_wh3_main_tmb_house_everlasting_life	An eerie repose in resin-soaked linen under the solemn vigil and ceaseless chanting of withered papyrus-bearers offers unparalleled rejuvenation.	false
building_flavour_texts_flavour_wh_dlc03_horde_beastmen_arcane_1	Bray-Shamans are born into magic and wield it with instinctive ease. A palpable miasma of dark sorcery surrounds them and when roused to anger, reality itself distorts. Trees writhe at their passing, insects scurry to their feet, and when the Bray -Shamans come to rest, the ground boils, rising up into a fell mound, clogged with tree roots and bones. These mounds are places of power where the Bray-Shamans recite litanies to the Gods. 	false
building_flavour_texts_flavour_wh_dlc03_horde_beastmen_arcane_2	Darkling councils are fortunately rare for when the most powerful Bray-Shamans gather together putting aside their own enmities then the nations of order should be wary. Here the darkling council gathers to offer darkling counsel to each other... but such a concentration of magic-users in the heart of the deepest forests is sure to lure out Cygors from their caves. In most cases, this is a deliberate act by the council, for a Cygor is a powerful weapon to send against mankind and its allies. 	false
building_flavour_texts_flavour_wh_dlc03_horde_beastmen_centigors_1	Centigors live mainly on the northern and eastern reaches of the Old World, where the trees are reluctant to yield to the sparse grasslands. They are creatures of brute thought and clumsy nature, and will battle the elements in the open or seek natural shelters rather than fashion their own. In fact they remain bitter and jealous of creature, including Gors, that can make encampments.    	false
building_flavour_texts_flavour_wh_dlc03_horde_beastmen_centigors_2	Beastmen, especially Bray-Shamans, use Centigors as messengers sending them far and wide across the blood-grounds, forming a very basic network between the warherds. This isn't the most complex or reliable form of communication but as well as can be expected from a race that despises civilisation. On their travels, Centigors are known to stop in the lee of cliffs or hollows to wait out the elements, inevitably indulging in revelry, delaying messages even further. 	false
building_flavour_texts_flavour_wh_dlc03_horde_beastmen_centigors_3	Being unable to create their own permanent homes, the Centigors will eke out a nomadic existence but should they come across a shelter made of rocky shelves or a deep cave not already inhabited by some other terror, then the Centigors will fight, clashing horns and nasty kicks until the strongest bucks have asserted themselves and can take the prime lair for themselves. 	false
building_flavour_texts_flavour_wh_dlc03_horde_beastmen_creatures_1	The basic pens and den areas of the Beastmen encampment are where the canine creatures that deign to follow the Cloven Ones are kennelled. The Warhounds while fierce in battle are more pliant in rare times of rest for the Gors, and the chieftains especially, will swiftly slay any beast and have it on a spit should it prove defiant. 	false
building_flavour_texts_flavour_wh_dlc03_horde_beastmen_creatures_2	The blood-grounds can be vast and contain many leagues of hostile forested territory. Ranging from desolate heathland to dense blood thickets and mysterious forests. There are places where toxic fumes or poisoned geysers break free of the ground. Such areas are favoured by the followers of Nurgle, it is where the Maggoth Lords have mustered hordes in the past and any creatures that run free in such areas may be blessed with the God of Decay's gifts. 	false
building_flavour_texts_flavour_wh_dlc03_horde_beastmen_creatures_3	The pitted woodland is full of chasms, crags and deep pits half-filled with stagnant water. Such pits are shunned by even Ungors, yet they are good places to keep the Chaos Spawn. The deep pit sides are farm more stable and escape-proof than ramshackle fencing and the sties of the Razorgor. For an escaped and hungry Spawn will devour anyone or anything in its path. 	false
building_flavour_texts_flavour_wh_dlc03_horde_beastmen_giants_1	The deep forests are home to many large and evil creatures - Ghorgons and Cygors can all be found wandering the blood-grounds. Some will inhabit caves, formed in the higher crags where the mountain chains meet the forest canopies. Giant's favour these lairs as well, and will think nothing of taking such a lair of existing dweller should the titan prove able enough.  	false
building_flavour_texts_flavour_wh_dlc03_horde_beastmen_gors_1	Dug-outs are more like gouges taken out of the rutted and bone-strewn ground. They are normally furthest from the centre of the camp, close to the Warhound pens and where the Spawn are chained. This is where the lesser beasts seek a rudimentary shelter. And even then, tribal hierarchy is still a factor as the Ungor fight amongst themselves to see who will get to lie in the dug outs and who must sleep on the forest floor. 	false
building_flavour_texts_flavour_wh_dlc03_horde_beastmen_gors_2	Often starting as mere dug-outs, pit-hovels get deeper, offering better protection from the elements, making them more desirable to the Ungor that claim them. However, while the Ungor regard the hovels as crude lairs, the Gors of the warherd use them as disposal pits, a place to cast off rotting carcasses, and other foul detritus. Of course, they are fully aware that such pits are also Ungor hovels, but that makes their use as refuse heaps all the more satisfying.  	false
building_flavour_texts_flavour_wh_dlc03_horde_beastmen_gors_3	Burrows are never more than temporary shelters for the Gors, as they will quickly move onto to another part of the blood-grounds. Yet when they do seek shelter in a root-and-earthen enclave they will often seal such area with hide, freshly flayed from some unfortunate prey, be they mannish filth or some other poor creature. These same hides can be used in battle, hardened and placed on their crude shields. 	false
building_flavour_texts_flavour_wh_dlc03_horde_beastmen_gors_4	Beastmen put great stock in their fetishes and grim totems, and will quickly festoon any camp or clearing they claim with such vile tokens. For the Bestigors, it is the collected pelts of vanquished Gors and other forest prey that mark their status within the warherd. Their trophies are draped over a totem by the Bestigor tents when in camp, but taken and worn when they roam the beast-paths.	false
building_flavour_texts_flavour_wh_dlc03_horde_beastmen_herd_1	The Beastmen build no cities for order and construction are anathema to them. They wander far, following the scent of fresh meat and hunting to death whatever trespasses into the ancient blood-grounds that the Beastmen patrol. Although the blood-grounds comprise of many leagues of dread woodland there are nexus points, where the herds tend to gather, perhaps at a junction of the beast-paths, or a favoured hunting spot.   	false
building_flavour_texts_flavour_wh_dlc03_horde_beastmen_herd_2	In the deepest parts of the forests are the hag trees, with trunks swollen on corruption and roots that seek out blood for sustenance. The canopies of such trees are filled with mewling, be-mouthed leaves and are decorated with crude and vile fetishes. As well as a gathering point for warherds, they are places where Bray-shaman come to commune with the Dark Gods.   	false
building_flavour_texts_flavour_wh_dlc03_horde_beastmen_herd_3	Squalid camps are crude affairs, often consisting of little more than a raging pyre surrounded by a mass of rude burrows and rough pelt barriers. Sometimes other skins, still dripping with gore, will be held up by sticks and branches to form makeshift tents. More powerful Beastmen have positions closest to the fire while weaker creatures set their pathetic abodes further out of the circle. 	false
building_flavour_texts_flavour_wh_dlc03_horde_beastmen_herd_4	Deep burrows hollowed out by the blood-seeking root systems of hag trees or caverns that were once the foetid homes of Cygors and Jabberslythes may be large enough to hold entire brayherds and give a crude amount of shelter should the weather become violent enough that even the Beastmen must take cover while the Dark Powers storm-rage overhead. 	false
building_flavour_texts_flavour_wh_dlc03_horde_beastmen_herd_5	The largest gatherings of rival tribes, where the brayherds are often called are places of entangled beast-paths, ancient herdstones, and catacombs of wending passages that lead deep into the ground. These are the cursed labyrinths, whose secrets are only truly known by the Bray-Shamans. Minotaurs, not being the most intelligent of species, are especially susceptible to getting lost within and will spend the rest of their lives wandering the maze. 	false
building_flavour_texts_flavour_wh_dlc03_horde_beastmen_minotaurs_1	Minotaurs are possessed of a terrible hunger for flesh, especially that of men. This is the blessing given to the bull-headed beasts by the Chaos Gods. Such flesh is readily devoured on the battlefield - cold, raw and dripping in blood, sending Minotaurs into a frenzy. However, should a prisoner of battle or raids be taken, then their fate will most likely be in the fire pit, their flesh cooked, the smell of which drawing Minotaurs from afar. 	false
building_flavour_texts_flavour_wh_dlc03_horde_beastmen_minotaurs_2	Minotaur's are gluttons and would feast on any food within reach. But the guiding horns of Bray-shamans have taught the herds to store flesh, for there are days of famine as well as feasting, when prey is scarce. In these times the larder can be used and the putrefying meat within thrown into the fire pit and fought over by the fiercest and hungriest. 	false
building_flavour_texts_flavour_wh_dlc03_horde_beastmen_minotaurs_3	A raging pyre burns at the heart of the most prominent Beastmen encampments. The dancing, intense crimson flames are said to particularly ensnare Minotaur's, who are drawn to red for it represents blood. They see a mighty fire as representing the Blood God's will; the fire's strength and heat is the rage of them and their god made manifest.  	false
building_flavour_texts_flavour_wh_dlc03_horde_beastmen_razorgors_1	Sties constructed by Ungors are rarely strong enough to contain an angry Razorgor. Beastlords and the Razorgor keepers have learnt that the best way to contain such creatures is to make sure they are fully sated before being led into the sty. Then - hopefully - the many-tusked, porcine beast will sleep and wallow in the muddy gore of the sty floor until needed by the tribe. 	false
building_flavour_texts_flavour_wh_dlc03_horde_beastmen_razorgors_2	Wood is a constant requirement for the Beastmen, they use it in myriad ways where it is to create rudimentary pends and shelters or for fuelling pyres and even in weapon manufacture. Being creatures of the woods they are never far from it, although they tend to scavenge and pile it up rather than farm it like man-filth, for that would be far to much like the civil ways or Gors are born to destroy. 	false
building_flavour_texts_flavour_wh_dlc03_horde_beastmen_ruination_1	Beastmen show and delight in mankind inevitable downfall in many ways. There is the raiding and destruction, of course, but leaving piles of the dead and rotting across the realms is a visible reminder that nowhere is safe and the Cloven Ones are never far away. Such dedications are also direct conduits to the Realm of Chaos, the Pox Father is particular fond of such deposits as breeding grounds for his latest disease.    	false
building_flavour_texts_flavour_wh_dlc03_horde_beastmen_ruination_2	There is a surfeit of Gods in the Old World each with its own shrines, altars and holy places. But the Beastmen despoil all, taking the sacred grounds and dedicating it to the Ruinous Powers and so Chaos Corruption spreads. This is particularly problematic for Taal and the Elven god, Kurnous, both of who have altars deep in the forests and so are particularly susceptible to having their holy sites corrupted.  	false
building_flavour_texts_flavour_wh_dlc03_horde_beastmen_weapons_1	Beastmen have little care for money, the Emperor's coin is a tangible sign of the civilisation they have sworn to cast down. But they do find great stock in man-made weapons, especially blades, for they as a race, have no skills in forging. And so a warherd's armoury must be scavenged or taken, such relics are placed in a mound controlled by the Beastlord or even stood against a herdstone.	false
building_flavour_texts_flavour_wh_dlc03_horde_beastmen_weapons_2	The horned totem is created by the Bray-Shamans, a vile thing made of horns harvested from enemy warherds, and dedicated to the Granter of Savage Hate. It is tradition is some tribes that once given weapons and armour to stand by the horned totem and issue of bray; a promise that blood will be spilt in the Dark God's name. 	false
building_flavour_texts_flavour_wh_dlc05_wef_agent_protection	Within the Elven pantheon, Loec is the Trickster, the Shadow Dancer, and the God of Laughter, whose joyous voice stirs the spirits of the void. He often intervenes to prevent Slaanesh, the Chaos God, from taking the souls of the dead into the Realm of Chaos and eternal damnation. As such, Loec is forever hunted by the Ruinous Powers, but manages to always stay ahead of them due to his great cunning and tireless energy. Of course, such mischief also has a darker side, like the Elves themselves; oft-times, Loec's trickery is malicious and vengeful. Even the Forest Dragons, who generally pay little heed to the Elves and their ways, have respect for Loec as they too are intelligent creatures. Many even believe that Loec learned his craft from the Father of Dragons, Draugnir. Of course, the Trickster's most devoted acolytes, the Wardancers, hold the opposite view... 	false
building_flavour_texts_flavour_wh_dlc05_wef_armoury	Lord Daith is said to be the greatest living Elven smith, though his exact age is the subject of much debate. Like his patron god, Vaul, he is blind and performs his work by touch and the way hot metal changes the taste of the air around him. These hardships do nothing to slow him, or his tongue, which is said to be just as fiery as his forge.	false
building_flavour_texts_flavour_wh_dlc05_wef_cavalry	Athel Loren's southernmost border is home to the greatest horsemen of the Asrai. Cavaroc boasts grassland plains where their far-famed mounts graze. However, it isn't just their skill on horseback that the Elves of Cavaroc are famous for; it is said that those who dwell there are quick to act and even quicker to anger. Whenever the Asrai take part in some act of military folly, it is bound to be a Glade Rider from Skymark leading the charge. 	false
building_flavour_texts_flavour_wh_dlc05_wef_dragons	You wouldn't think a creature as large and ungainly as a Dragon could live happily within the forest, would you? Well, you'd be wrong. The Forest Dragons are a species who long ago adapted to life within the forest, safe below its leafy canopy from the 'heroes' who wish them extinct so they can hang macabre trophies upon their walls. Elsewhere in the Old World, many of their race have been entirely wiped out in this way, but it is the foolish adventurer who enters Athel Loren hoping to kill or even see one in the flesh. Like everything in the forest, Forest Dragons have become part of their woodland environment and its gestalt-like will to survive. As you might expect, they are a ferocious enemy and more than a match for most opponents. As such, they hunt only when the forest requires their presence, waking from their hibernation when large foes, too powerful for the forest spirits to contain by themselves, are abroad. Sometimes Forest Dragons are summoned to serve as mounts for the Wood Elf Glade Lords, a request which they are generally happy to accept should the forest ultimately benefit.	false
building_flavour_texts_flavour_wh_dlc05_wef_fletcher	Wood Elves prefer to craft their own arrows, from humble warriors to highborns from ancient bloodlines, all place great importance on the contents of their quivers. Asrai are taught to bend a bow from the moment they are strong enough to hold it, and the skills required to craft their own weapons follow shortly after. Every archer carries a single flint-headed arrow, inscribed with the words 'Ethris Yl Idrion' or 'The Maker's Tears'. These powerful arrows are reserved for the most dread of foes.	false
building_flavour_texts_flavour_wh_dlc05_wef_flying	High up on the windswept crags above Athel Loren live those Elves given the honour of riding the Great Eagles. There is an immense bond of kinship between the Elves of Athel Loren and the Great Eagles that stretches back to ancient times. Much like the Asrai, the Eagles are creatures of unceasing vigilance and often provide the Lords of the Deepwood with much-needed warnings of impending danger.	false
building_flavour_texts_flavour_wh_dlc05_wef_garrison	Wild places breed wild people and nowhere is this truer than in Athel Loren. There are Elven Lords and Ladies who live their entire lives in glittering halls and know nothing of the hardships of the Deepwood, but there are others who are raised to know that the forest is not always forgiving. These Elves often choose to live away from Court, preferring the company of the forest as they keep their constant vigil.	false
building_flavour_texts_flavour_wh_dlc05_wef_growth	All Asrai are hunters, they have to be in order to survive in Athel Loren. However, Wood Elves do not hunt for sport, as it is forbidden by Kurnous. His creed states that a hunter should only kill ravening beasts or animals whose bounty of meat and hide are necessary for survival. However, when the horns of the Wild Riders are heard upon the wind this is forgotten and all Elves follow the mortal embodiment of Kurnous - Orion - into the frenzy of the Wild Hunt.	false
building_flavour_texts_flavour_wh_dlc05_wef_income	As the Wood Elves are a race for whom feasting takes on an almost spiritual quality, it shouldn't be a great surprise to learn that, deep with Athel Loren's forest glades, land is set aside especially for the cultivation of fine grapes for winemaking. And not just any wine either - the wondrous nectar the Asrai produce is among the finest, if not the finest, anywhere in the Old World. Not that many outsiders have had the privilege, of course; as you might expect, as in other matters the Elves are snobbish and aloof, dismissing the attempts of other races as pathetic, borderline-undrinkable imitations of the real thing and rarely allow anyone from beyond Athel Loren to try it.	false
building_flavour_texts_flavour_wh_dlc05_wef_income_buff	The halls of Athel Loren ring with laughter and often play host to spectacular feasts. These glorious places and the sumptuous feasts eaten within them are well hidden, and any outsider who  stumbles upon them is lucky to have lived long enough to do so. It has even, on occasion, been known for a select few to join an Elven feast, but woe betide those foolish enough to eat or drink of the fine fayre on offer without the permission of their Elven hosts.	false
building_flavour_texts_flavour_wh_dlc05_wef_melee	The seasons play an important part in the lives of the Asrai. As Winter takes hold of the Deepwood the forest spirits lose their potency and even the most vicious of Dryads find themselves sluggish and incapable of their usual level of scheming. It is at this time that the Eternal Guard take over guardianship of Athel Loren. Within the Winterheart, the Eternal Guard are ever ready; cloaked in Winter, the forest spirits sleep peacefully, awaiting the arrival of a glorious Spring that will never come.	false
building_flavour_texts_flavour_wh_dlc05_wef_oak_of_ages	At the centre of Athel Loren's multifarious glades and boughs lies the Oak of Ages. The great tree occupies its space both physically and spiritually, in the very essence of the forest and its dwellers. For the Wood Elves, it is the birthplace of their realm and the place where Orion, King in the Woods and a figurehead of their culture, symbolically dies and is reborn each year. Although immortal, he is tied to the seasons and subject to their changes. At Midwinter, Orion willingly enters his own funeral pyre; the following Spring, a new candidate, prepared and fashioned in her consort's likeness by Queen Ariel, emerges from the Oak as the new living embodiment of the Master of the Hunt. As such, the Oak of Ages is the hub of the Wood Elves' power - as it grows, their kingdom and influence grows also.	false
building_flavour_texts_flavour_wh_dlc05_wef_office_starlight_forge	The light and warmth from Vaul's Anvil, the forge temple of the maker god, bathes the surrounding glades in a ruddy glow. Forest spirits for miles around are drawn to the bright fires and loud noises of Elven craftsmen at work, mesmerised by the warming glow but terrified of the untold destruction the fires could visit upon their home.	false
building_flavour_texts_flavour_wh_dlc05_wef_office_the_wild_heath	The vast heathland surrounding Athel Loren is where the cultures of the Elves and men meet. Here and there, burial mounds and standing stones emerge from the scrub of heather and bracken. The giant Elven Waystones are the largest of course, erected many centuries before by the Wood Elves to contain the many dangerous, malevolent spirits found within the forest and to prevent their influence spilling out into the world. Sometimes, the trees themselves break free of Athel Loren's boundaries, causing the Spellsingers to work their magic and coax the ancients back into their proper places. Note, however, that this is not done out of concern for the other races who live outside Athel Loren, but to maintain the delicate balance and unity of the forest and its inhabitants.	false
building_flavour_texts_flavour_wh_dlc05_wef_office_wardancer_feast_halls	Thought unpredictable and not quite trusted by other Wood Elves, the Wardancers of Athel Loren are indeed a wild troupe. Wondering the pathways of the forest, they know all its secret routes and ways. Keepers of Elven history, Wardancers re-enact the countless stories and legends through the visual arts, and thereby pass that knowledge down to all Asrai who witness their displays. Of course, dancing is a joyous act, so the Wardancers also lead their people in celebration of the Elvish way. Their feast halls are where the kindred gather to feast and play music, rejoicing in their culture and learning of their illustrious past.	false
building_flavour_texts_flavour_wh_dlc05_wef_office_wildwood_waystones	In the south-eastern corner of Athel Loren lies the Wildwood, home to the most malevolent of forest spirits. Despite living in relative harmony for generations, there are still many that would love to see the Wood Elves removed from their forest home. It was with this in mind that the Asrai constructed a Waystone fence to imprison the wildest and most troublesome of the forest spirits; chief among them is the Ancient, Coeddil.	false
building_flavour_texts_flavour_wh_dlc05_wef_outpost	The Fey Folk place little or no importance on other races or their ways. Being so long-lived, outsiders' lives appear to the Asrai as those of 'mayflies' - a contemptuous and derogatory term but one which well illustrates their indifference. It would be reasonable to expect, then, that in conquest they do not make use of their enemies' buildings and infrastructure. Therefore, Elvish outposts are constructed, often within the trees of course, from which they control their captured territory.	false
building_flavour_texts_flavour_wh_dlc05_wef_outpost_foraging_1	Wild places breed wild people and nowhere is this truer than in Athel Loren. There are Elven Lords and Ladies who live their entire lives in glittering halls and know nothing of the hardships of the Deepwood, but there are others who are raised to know that the forest is not always forgiving. These Elves often choose to live away from Court, preferring the company of the forest as they keep their constant vigil.	false
building_flavour_texts_flavour_wh_dlc05_wef_outpost_secondary	The Fey Folk place little or no importance on other races or their ways.

Therefore, Elvish outposts are constructed, often within the trees of course, from which they control their captured territory.	false
building_flavour_texts_flavour_wh_dlc05_wef_outpost_slaughter_1	All Asrai are hunters, they have to be in order to survive in Athel Loren. However, Wood Elves do not hunt for sport, as it is forbidden by Kurnous. His creed states that a hunter should only kill ravening beasts or animals whose bounty of meat and hide are necessary for survival.

building_flavour_texts_flavour_wh_dlc05_wef_public_order	The true craft of the Wood Elves lies in their ability to blend their homes seamlessly with the forest. The King's Glade is a glorious city built from the branches of great oaks; canopies, walkways and even vaults have been constructed from their branches and roots. This huge and impressive city is completely invisible to outsiders, not only because it is high in the canopy or deep beneath the earth, but also thanks to the cloaking magic woven by its Spellsingers.	false
building_flavour_texts_flavour_wh_dlc05_wef_ranged	Over centuries, the Deepwood has been tamed by the Wood Elves, yet still there are dark places where few dare to tread. These are the haunts of the Wildwood Rangers and the Wardancers, the wilder inhabitants of Athel Loren. Through their constant vigilance, sinister forest spirits and rampaging outsiders are kept in check and through their sacrifices the Lords and Ladies are kept safe in their beds at night.	false
building_flavour_texts_flavour_wh_dlc05_wef_settlement	The beauty of Athel Loren is seldom seen by outsiders. Many shun it as a haunted place, filled with darkness and a deep sense foreboding. Even the most courageous of Bretonnian Knights cannot help but feel uneasy beneath the eaves of the Deepwood, for their is a sense of watchfulness that fills every glade and hollow. Those brave enough to venture in soon find themselves helplessly lost; some never find their way home, others walk for years only to re-emerge from the forest moments after they entered it.	false
building_flavour_texts_flavour_wh_dlc05_wef_spellsingers	There are certain areas of Athel Loren that draw the Winds of Magic, and none more so than the Oak of Ages. Beneath its ancient boughs, generations of Spellsingers have learned their craft. It is said that the very appearance of the Oak of Ages changes as the Winds of Magic rise and fall. From a twisted semblance of its former glory, when the sinister Wind of Shyish blows strong, to its most spectacular, when Ghyran sweeps through the forest.	false
building_flavour_texts_flavour_wh_dlc05_wef_temples	For most races, their gods are distant beings who set down laws for them to live by in centuries long forgotten. Not so for the Wood Elves. Their gods live among them in the mortal forms of Ariel and Orion. The Mage Queen and her consort, the King in the Woods, rule Athel Loren with the aid of their council consisting of the Lords and Ladies of the Eternal Realms. Though most decisions are reached only when the council are in full agreement, it is Ariel who holds the true power in Athel Loren.	false

Older than even other Treemen, it was they who first allowed the Wood Elves to make their home in the sacred forest. Ancients prefer a life spent dreaming to the waking world, which to them appears increasingly desaturated as the ages pass. Only in dire times do they wake, when the Gathering of the Ancients meets or to lead Athel Loren in times of need. Led by Durthu, eldest and mightiest of his kind, the Ancients use their wisdom to nurture the forest realms, but will also focus their illimitable rage upon threats to Athel Lorenâ€™s delicately-balanced harmony.	false
building_flavour_texts_flavour_wh_dlc05_wef_tree_spirits	The forest of Athel Loren is ancient beyond counting and many of the spirits that call it home remember a time before the Elves trod its paths. Some are happy to live in harmony with the Asrai, but there are those who seek to bring about the Wood Elves' ruin at every opportunity. Many of the most malevolent spirits were imprisoned in the Wild Wood centuries ago, but still there are those who plot in secret and will use any means necessary to rid the Deepwood of its Elven infestation. 	false

However, should they travel beneath its bower they will soon find themselves hopelessly lost, or dead. The pathways twist and turn and are ever changing, some are only trodden by the most experienced Wardancers and Waystalkers. Even the Lords and Ladies of Athel Loren are careful to avoid getting lost within the Deepwood, for they know what horrors await them should they stumble into the wrong glade.	false

After many centuries of occupation by those who care little for beauty in architecture and craftsmanship â€“ and indeed not defecating right where they sleep and then throwing it all over the place â€“ the once-great fortress has fallen to wrack and ruin. To return Karak Eight Peaks to its former glory working parties must be sent out to clear away the massive piles of dead Goblins, Orcs and other assorted filth that have accumulated. Thatâ€™s just the start, however - the piles of rubbish and poo left behind by the urks must be immediately cleaned up as a dire threat to public health (no small feat in itself) and then an army of masons and carpenters will be sent in. Their job will be to repair the damage to the structure caused by years of Greenskin neglect and abuse, before more Dwarfs arrive to polish the interior, reactivating the great glowing stones attached to the ceilings and filling the halls with light for the first time in many a year. Beneath the city, Dwarf Miners and Engineers will re-open seams where possible and dig new ones when not. Powerful weapons will be retrieved from within the Ancestor Tombs and ranged against prospective foes. Furthermore, new and better defences will be put in place â€“ to ensure Karak Eight Peaks can never again be wrested from its rightful owners. Soon, the clamour of hammer on anvil will be heard here again, along with the raising of voices and flagons to toast their intrepid king, Belegar Ironhammer, and the birth of a second Karaz Ankor to rival the first!	false

building_flavour_texts_flavour_wh_dlc06_grn_squigs_1	Naturally, wrangling Squigs is a tricky business, and an even trickier business for the stupid gobbos assigned to have a care for their wellbeing. Squigs are useful on the battlefield, but when not fighting they have to be caged to prevent the indiscriminate murder of the whole tribe. This in turn presents its own set of problems. Over time, and many casualties, Squig handlers have learned that if you feed the greedy, ferocious gits a constant supply of mushrooms this stops them from eating each other. However, get caught with your arm in their cage and without a mushroom in your hand and itâ€™s probably game over for you. Even if they beat the odds and live to tell the tale, maimed former-handlers are of little further use to da Boss. If he has an imagination, they get strapped to wings and fired at the enemy as Doom Divers; if he hasnâ€™t then the Squigs get a tasty treat at feeding time!	false
building_flavour_texts_flavour_wh_dlc08_nor_resource_iron_1	Iron ore is certainly an important material for any war-mongering group, steel being the primary metal from which Norscan weapons and armour are forged. Norscan mining techniques are slightly more primitive than other racesâ€™, due to the fact that thralls are used to do most of the dirty and dangerous work, meaning that safety is often the least of their concerns and mine cave-ins are common. It is thought that with many other races, their primitive mining techniques were originally stolen from the Dwarfs, who were delving into mineshafts long before most races of men were even using fire.	false
building_flavour_texts_flavour_wh_dlc08_nor_resource_marble_1	Although highly sought-after in the Old World and highly abundant in the north, Norscans themselves have little use for marble. It is, after all, primarily used as a decorative construction material - and the Northmen are more interested in destroying rather than building.

building_flavour_texts_flavour_wh_dlc08_nor_resource_obsidian_1	In Norsca, obsidian is one of the most prized materials for use in armour-making. Although few Marauders are lucky enough to have it, it is thought that many Chaos Champions wear such armour for its bulky, sinister appearance, striking fear into the hearts of individuals who face them. Obsidian is almost always used in full suits of armour due to its bulky nature, which may cause the user a disadvantage if they do not have the strength to bear such a suit. This potential disadvantage makes obsidian impractical to use without that essential intimidation factor.	false

building_flavour_texts_flavour_wh_main_brt_farm_extra	Bretonnian peasants are required to work the fields and provide for the realm, yet they do not do so entirely without aid. Great mills, built to grind grain for storage, can be powered by the back-breaking work of man or horse, but there is much greater efficiency to be found by harnessing the strength of wind and water. As grain is fundamental to the survival of both peasant and high-born alike, the mills of Bretonnia are crucial to the agricultural economy that keeps the realm alive.	false

building_flavour_texts_flavour_wh_main_brt_hospital	The peasants of Bretonnia are not a clean people, but nor does this fact particularly concern them. Indeed, when plague descends, as it inevitably does, these miserable low-born folk curse fate and poor luck; believing themselves destined by the gods to suffer. The squalid, pox-ridden rabble seek what solace they can find, congregating in ramshackle shelters or, if the duke is compassionate, established sanctuaries. Here, they may receive the Lady's Blessing, although a cure is seldom amongst her favours. Moreover, these quarantine shelters create convenient incubators for the plague, consigning the peasantry to an almost certainly slow, disgusting death, whilst sparing those outside. Those of nobler birth, however, find better results in apothecaries who take cares to prevent the spread of malignancy through an array of alchemical concoctions - only for those who can pay, of course.	false

Itâ€™s back-breaking work, so foremen and overseers are required to ensure that the peasants do not slacken off or pause to rest, and that they are dragged out of the way when they collapse from sheer exhaustion. It is their lot â€“ the miserable, undeserving rabble should expect nothing less.	false
building_flavour_texts_flavour_wh_main_brt_industry_extra	Most things, such as they are, tend to spoil if left exposed to the brutal elements of the Old World. How best, thought the realms of men, to fix this problem? The solution - storage. At first they built root cellars beneath shops and mills to house the fabrics produced or left over following a day's work. However, as time passed and the kingdom became more industrious, the need for a larger storage solution became evident. And so vast structures were erected with the sole purpose of housing all and sundry that the Bretonnians had need to contain; things that heretofore had been left vulnerable to the unforgiving harshness of the outside world.	false

Incensed by this newfound glory, he travelled the dukedoms, continuing to slaughter Greenskins by the score. The stalwart dukes who fought alongside him came to be known as the Grail Companions, and together they rode to twelve mighty victories over the Greenskin hordes. Such was the magnitude of the massacre that they say the piles of corpses burned so bright that night appeared as day, and upon this shining beacon was Bretonnia the kingdom founded. So majestic was the Companions' victory that the Abbey was erected in their honour, that all Bretonnians may worship and remember, aspiring to their heroic deeds; for it is the doom of the realm to forget...	false

building_flavour_texts_flavour_wh_main_brt_settlement_major_2	A village may be located at a bridge or crossroads, somewhere that has more foot traffic than a hamlet.

building_flavour_texts_flavour_wh_main_brt_settlement_major_3	"One tower towns" is the derogatory label some Lords give to their smaller settlements, where taxes are low due to a small population and a lack of commerce.

building_flavour_texts_flavour_wh_main_brt_settlement_major_4	Although still a populace mainly concerned with agriculture, Bretonnian cities grow each year, as more and more smallfolk head to there for work and safety. In many cases, the urban sprawl has overrun its original boundaries and foulburgs have cropped up, clinging to the sides of the curtain walls like limpets to a prow. On higher ground are the more stately structures, nobles' manses and baronial castles, all sporting the distinctive Bretonnian round towers.	false
building_flavour_texts_flavour_wh_main_brt_settlement_major_5	Bretonnia's largest cities are tall, as they are almost always built on high ground. Their castles are also relatively tall and thin compared to the large square and absurdist blocks of Empire architecture.

Of course, most peasants do not have to ride to war in heavy barding or face the terrors that the Knights of the Realm do when in battle.

Here, there is a whole cottage industry built around trekking into the Grey Mountains, hunting wild pegasi - or their foals - and then rearing or training them to be suitable battlefield mounts for Knights of the Realm.	false
building_flavour_texts_flavour_wh_main_brt_stables_5	Only the bravest, or most foolish, Bretonnian Knights dream of capturing and taming their own Hippogryph. Such fearsome, quarrelsome beasts are very difficult to bring to heel, and many a Knight has met a grizzly end in the attempt. Yet those who succeed are heralded as bold indeed, and their prized steeds are kept under careful watch in the Royal Menageries, until such a time as Bretonnia has need of the Hippogryph's baleful strength.	false
building_flavour_texts_flavour_wh_main_brt_tavern_4	Down the side streets and alleyways of Bretonnian towns and cities, there are taverns that serve another purposeâ€¦ a primal purpose. As the noise travels from the dark innards to the street, passers-by and potential patrons alike get a hint of what lies beyond the threshold. Those who cross the breach step into a world of tawdry wonder and debauched hedonism - all at a reasonable price of course.	false
building_flavour_texts_flavour_wh_main_brt_worship_1	The Lady is a humble goddess or so her pilgrims claim. She is happiest among the wilds of Bretonnia, in the rivers and lakes rather than confined to temples like the brutish warrior gods of the Empire. As such, her shrines are usually rustic affairs or even hidden groves of great beauty, where the pious can pray in peace.	false
building_flavour_texts_flavour_wh_main_brt_worship_2	The Grail chapels were built at the start of Gilles Le Breton's reign. He ordered them raised to show his devotion to the Lady, so they have remained, although some have fallen into ruin as the population has been reduced by war, famine and disease. However, many are still in use as places of worship and guarded by a Grail Knight - a chivalrous warrior who has supped from the Grail itself.	false
building_flavour_texts_flavour_wh_main_brt_worship_3	Over the years, kings and Lords, to show their devotion, have built grand cathedrals to venerate the Lady. However, her most pious followers believe these structures to be little more than vanity projects that shun the Lady's teachings and that she is more likely to be found in a humble grove than an opulent temple. Yet there are those that beg to differ, those who think grand statements imbue the Lady with power and enable her relics to be kept safe from despoilers.	false
building_flavour_texts_flavour_wh_main_chs_port	While Dwarfs carve quays out of solid rock, the Orcs and Norse have little more than wooden planks that jut into the sea. Empire wharfs - including those in Sylvania - are generally much sturdier. Since much of their trade comes down the large rivers they need reliable platforms of timber and stone to enable their ships to dock.	false
building_flavour_texts_flavour_wh_main_dwf_barracks_1	Any Dwarf warrior worth his beard likes to keep his axe skills sharp. Sparring chambers are oft found in the lower deeps of a Hold or fortress. They are the places where Dwarf Warriors and the fractious Dawi of the mining Guilds come to test their mettle and the keenness of their axes or mattocks. 	false
building_flavour_texts_flavour_wh_main_dwf_barracks_2	Dwarf barracks are long halls with rows of short stone pallets for resting and lengthy tables for feasting and drinking. Greenskin heads are mounted at the far end, usually with bolts sprouting from them where the Quarrellers have fired off their practice shots. 	false
building_flavour_texts_flavour_wh_main_dwf_barracks_3	The horns will sound through the Hold and from the barracks will file the Dwarfs with axes out and sharp. The hornâ€™s deep sound will also bring the grumbling Longbeards from the council chambers and the Slayers from the shrines to from a form a throng worthy of Grudgebearerâ€™s rage!	false
building_flavour_texts_flavour_wh_main_dwf_barracks_4	Along the walls of the Hall of Warriors are the names of every Dawi that has died in defence of the Hold. It is a shrine to Grimnir and the place to which the king calls his most trusted warriors, whether they come from the deeps - such as the Ironbreakers - or from his own side, like the Hammerers. 	false
building_flavour_texts_flavour_wh_main_dwf_engineer_1	A Dwarf engineerâ€™s workshop typically contains a private forge, heavy work benches and a plethora of other tools which they use to work on magnificent clockworks, steam engines - whatever their latest obsession is. Or course, the line between tinkering and innovating is a slim one - the Engineers' Guild frowns upon the latter. 	false
building_flavour_texts_flavour_wh_main_dwf_engineer_2	Every Dwarfhold contains a hall owned by and for the exclusive use of the Engineers' Guild. This is where the grandest workshops will be located and where master engineers train the callow, bearded youths of the next age in the manufacture of steam engines, mining machines and the vast array of other devices that make the Guild so powerful. 	false
building_flavour_texts_flavour_wh_main_dwf_farm_1	Over time, Dwarfs have cultivated an especially tough variety of barley, the grains of which are either ground down into flour for use in baking stone bread, or malted as an essential ingredient in all manner of Dwarfish ales, beers and spirits.	false
building_flavour_texts_flavour_wh_main_dwf_farm_2	Dwarf granaries are vast store chambers, usually, but not always, located within their Holds. While some wheat is farmed and stored, it is the hardy varieties of barley which the Dwarfs desire - those that cling to the mountainsides. The grains are stored in the granaries and dried via residual heat from the Holdâ€™s forges.	false
building_flavour_texts_flavour_wh_main_dwf_farm_3	Dwarf stone bread is very fortifying â€“ if youâ€™re a Dwarf. Other races find it more challenging, partly because stone bread is made from a mixture of barley flour, ale and stone dust. As you might expect, different Holds have diverse recipes depending on available minerals. So, for example, Grey Mountain stone bread is typically chalkier than the limestone flavours of Zhufbar.	false
building_flavour_texts_flavour_wh_main_dwf_farm_4	Stone bread is the hallmark of Dwarf bakers. Like the brewmasters of every Hold, master bakers like to make their signature bake, be it 'burnt goat cream pies', 'sausage and beer rolls' or 'boulder cakes'. What is made depends on the status of their local Guild and the skill of the master baker in question.	false
building_flavour_texts_flavour_wh_main_dwf_garrison_1	Security within a functioning Hold is less of an issue, for Dwarfs are rarely dishonest or thieves by nature. Having said that, there are guard posts and watch rooms to defend the hallowed shrines of the vast treasure vaults. Dwarfs on guard duty are deployed most notably in these places, along with the lower deeps, whose portals lead to the Underway.   	false
building_flavour_texts_flavour_wh_main_dwf_garrison_2	Guard halls are larger quarters where a good part of a Holdâ€™s defensive force is garrisoned. The guards are ready to react should an enemy force invade, whether from above or below, but the Ironbreakers are the Holdâ€™s first line of defence should an attack come from the deeps. 	false
building_flavour_texts_flavour_wh_main_dwf_garrison_3	Every Dwarf king has a royal garrison made of warriors of royal blood, forming the bulwark of his "Hammerers", the king's personal bodyguard. The garrison is housed close to the royal chambers and throne hall, so they are on hand should king and Hold require their particular services.	false
building_flavour_texts_flavour_wh_main_dwf_industry_1	A poor Dwarf with no vocation or Clan allegiance will either become a Slayer or gravitate towards the trade of a tinker â€“ an iterant whose store is little more than a bench and the items in his sack. As well as his stock, he also has a knack for fixing things, whether thatâ€™s creating tinkerâ€™s dams from pots and pans or more complex repairs on larger tools.	false
building_flavour_texts_flavour_wh_main_dwf_industry_2	Dwarfs are extremely good at building intricate devices, one of the reasons they make such good engineers. Dwarf tools are widely respected and used right across the world, not just in the Karaz Ankor either. Tools are therefore one of the major Dwarf exports to the human realms, and even the Elves used Dwarf tools and clockwork toys before relations between the two races grew hostile. 	false
building_flavour_texts_flavour_wh_main_dwf_industry_3	The larger Dwarfholds have a district set aside for their Guilds. While some of the lesser Guilds share chambers, the most powerful will have their own Guild halls, and a set of retainers to keep them clean and organised to the high standards that any self-respecting Clan member would expect. Toolmakers are one such Guild; while their home Hold is Karak Azul, they have Guild halls all across the realm. 	false
building_flavour_texts_flavour_wh_main_dwf_industry_4	Toolmakers are fast becoming a powerful force in Dwarfen society. Backed by Grudgebearer himself and King Stoneheart, their influence has spread from Zhufbar to most of the Karaks. Their foundries are busy workplaces, full of heat, banging and shouting Dwarfen craftspersons.  	false
building_flavour_texts_flavour_wh_main_dwf_port_1	While Dwarfs carve quays out of solid rock, the Orcs and Norse have little more than wooden planks that jut into the sea.

Since much of their trade comes down the large rivers they need reliable platforms of timber and stone to enable their ships to dock.	false
building_flavour_texts_flavour_wh_main_dwf_port_2	There are many harbours in the Old World, as the nations oft use the large flowing rivers to transport goods from one place to another. Even the Empire's great inland cities have some kind of harbour for massive river barges to dock. The most famous of all harbours, perhaps, is in Barak Varr, the sea-gate of the Karaz Ankor. 	false
building_flavour_texts_flavour_wh_main_dwf_port_3	Erengrad, Marienburg, Altdorf, Barak Varr, even the Orc pirate forts that riddle the coast by the Dragonback mountains are all built around or contain a series of ports. These are normally places that attract wealth, as they are great trading stations in those rare moments when there is a lull in the eternal war and also home to the fleet when it returns.	false
building_flavour_texts_flavour_wh_main_dwf_resource_beer_1	While no Dwarfhold is built without a brewery, Dwarf outposts or colonies may not be so fortunate. However, even these small enclaves of Dwarf civilisation have an ale store within their walls in which to keep the many casks of brew shipped in for immediate consumption. Even the Holds themselves contain at least one ale store, a cool room to allow the beer to mature to perfection.	false
building_flavour_texts_flavour_wh_main_dwf_resource_beer_2	Dwarf breweries are intrinsic to any Dwarfhold. It is here the master brewers prepare their ales - ales that all Dawi Hold in high regard. A brewery, whether it is inside or outside a Hold, is recognisable by its large copper stills in which the brews ferment and the very lifeblood of the Karaz Ankor is distilled.	false
building_flavour_texts_flavour_wh_main_dwf_resource_beer_3	The greatest master brewers are world-renowned for their creations, Dwarfs have been known to kill for a lot less than a tankard of "One-Fingerâ€™s Tar Drop", "Oleâ€™ Black Blood", "Ulf Hasslehovenâ€™s Beard-Maker", "Durgundâ€™s Hellfire" or even the legendary "Bugmanâ€™s XXXXXX". Renowned brewers create celebrated beer, Josef Bugman being the most famous of all. Some day he may return to the craft, but not before he has enacted his revenge to settle an outstanding grudge.	false
building_flavour_texts_flavour_wh_main_dwf_resource_beer_4	Every Brewmaster worth his beard will tamper and experiment with the Hold's recipes to create a beer unique to himself, one that he can proudly name and will be quaffed and liked by the Longbeards. These ales are usually boiled in the Brewmaster's private kettles and stored in old casks, away from the main stores, and served only at the king's request.	false
building_flavour_texts_flavour_wh_main_dwf_resource_dyes_1	Cinnabar shafts not controlled by the Dwarfs are almost always owned by the Gold College, which needs a constant supply mercury for its acolytes' many experiments in alchemy. However, the Dye-makers' Guild also needs blood rock to produce a very distinctive shade of crimson for its garments. Thus Cinnabar is in demand.Â Â Â 	false
building_flavour_texts_flavour_wh_main_dwf_resource_dyes_2	Cinnabar is rarely kept within the Karaz Ankor, being usually exported to the manling realms where there is much more demand, due no doubt to such fripperies among the nobles, such as wearing clothes in ever brighter shades. Dwarfs generally prefer more earthy tones, to match their beards. 	false
building_flavour_texts_flavour_wh_main_dwf_resource_dyes_3	While nothing like the demand of the manling realms, there is a market for the dye-makers' trade in the Karaz Ankor. Dwarfen plants are deliberately located away from the main Hold, where their noxious waste and odours can be kept from filling the Clan halls. Nevertheless, they turn a healthy profit. 	false
building_flavour_texts_flavour_wh_main_dwf_resource_dyes_4	The Dwarfen Dyers' Guild is small but wealthy thanks to the finding of new customers outside the Karaz Ankor. The Guild is ploughing these funds into protecting their plants, which for practical reasons are located well away from the Dwarfholds and Khazids. Unsurprisingly, the umgi Dyers' Guild of the Empire hasn't welcomed the Dwarfs into the marketplace and a price war is surely about to begin. 	false
building_flavour_texts_flavour_wh_main_dwf_resource_game_1	In areas with a good supply of game, hunting lodges are built as useful bases and to store kills before they are taken back to civilisation. Lodges are rarely inhabited on a constant basis, so when the season begins hunters always make sure they are clear of anything else that may have taken residence during the Winter months.Â 	false
building_flavour_texts_flavour_wh_main_dwf_resource_game_2	Dwarf rangers excel at hunting, typically choosing grounds on the mountainside or the lowlands beneath. Their chosen quarry very much depends on the environment and the time of year in which the hunt is taking place.	false
building_flavour_texts_flavour_wh_main_dwf_resource_game_3	A tannery takes the skins of animals and subjects them to a process known as 'liming'. This toughens and preserves them, gradually turning them into leather. A tanner will also preserve pelts by using a complex salting, oiling and waxing process.	false
building_flavour_texts_flavour_wh_main_dwf_resource_game_4	Dwarfs have been working leather far longer than men, yet it is not really a trade at which they excel, at least not in the same way as metalworking or gemcutting. As a result, while the quality of their goods is high, they are not the matchless examples of craftsmanship the Dwarfs are generally famed for. 	false
building_flavour_texts_flavour_wh_main_dwf_resource_gems_1	A single mineshaft is used for prospecting for potential deposits of gems and other baubles. Even so, Dwarf miners have a knack for divining where such seams may be. They sniff the ground, stamp around on the rocks and even look at the sky for what seems like an endless time, and then - apparently following some unseen signal - they start diggingâ€¦ 	false
building_flavour_texts_flavour_wh_main_dwf_resource_gems_2	Once a shaft is proven to contain a high yield, then more are sunk and a full-sized mine complex is constructed. Naturally, such a valuable resource needs protecting, for Orcs and other creatures like "shiny stuff" as much as Dwarfs and men, and will try to take it from the Dwarfen miners should they discover its location.	false
building_flavour_texts_flavour_wh_main_dwf_resource_gems_3	Gemcutters and other jewelsmiths earn a good living, both in the Dwarfholds and in the towns of men, for their skills are always in demand. Dwarf-cut stone is a thing of beauty, sliced with such exacting precision that even the aloof, judgemental Elves respect their skills. It is really no wonder at all that such stones are mounted in crowns and sceptres for rulers from across the Old World and beyond.	false
building_flavour_texts_flavour_wh_main_dwf_resource_gems_4	Men or Elves visiting the Gemcutters' Guild would see a hall gleaming with gems inserted in the walls at geometric points, but would probably still see something largely functional. To other Dwarfs, the hall is gaudy and a crude display of the Guild's wealth, used to remind other institutions and even the Royal Clans of the power they wield. 	false
building_flavour_texts_flavour_wh_main_dwf_resource_gold_1	The Dwarfs discovered gold long ago when the Karaz Ankor was still young. Even now, it has a strange hold over Dwarfen hearts, infecting them with an interminable greed or â€˜gold sicknessâ€™ in extreme cases. Yet they remain the masters of extracting it from rock, although man-made mines have found plenty of rich seams in recent times.Â 	false
building_flavour_texts_flavour_wh_main_dwf_resource_gold_2	A Hold's gold mines are its pride and often its greatest source of revenue. Despite being founded tens of thousands of years ago, Karaz-a-Karak still has gold mines in its bounds that provide healthy stipends. Better still, more new seams are being discovered and exploited right across the Karaz Ankor all the time. 	false
building_flavour_texts_flavour_wh_main_dwf_resource_gold_3	Like any forge, the gold smelter is a hot and horrid place to work. Unsurprisingly, the Dwarfs are better at it than most, able to withstand the temperatures and still produce golden bars free of imperfections and uniform in shape. As a result, a seasoned Dwarf smelter will find employ beyond the Karaz Ankor, in the realms of men.	false
building_flavour_texts_flavour_wh_main_dwf_resource_gold_4	"Even kings wish to be as rich as a goldsmith" is an old saying and one that is, oft-times, true, for the goldsmiths have control of the most precious commodity in the Everlasting Realm: gold. Dwarfs have had an unhealthy obsession with this metal for as long as they have been digging in the mountains, something that isn't going to change any time soon. 	false
building_flavour_texts_flavour_wh_main_dwf_resource_iron_1	While more exotic metals such as Gromril are highly prized - and searched for with obsessive determination by the Dwarfs - it is iron that turns the wheels of Dwarfen industry. From iron comes steel, the hard, durable material used in the manufacture of countless objects, from blades to war machines to steam-powered tanks.	false
building_flavour_texts_flavour_wh_main_dwf_resource_iron_2	Mining was first taught to man by the Dwarfs, who had been delving deep into the mountains long before humans mastered fire. These days, mines can be found anywhere where ore is discovered. The Worldâ€™s Edge Mountains have long been rich in iron seams, and there are no signs that this source of supply will be exhausted any time soon.	false
building_flavour_texts_flavour_wh_main_dwf_resource_iron_3	The largest smelteries in the Empire are in Nuln, where the Imperial Gunnery School stretches across an entire district, which has developed into a warren of forges, gunsmiths' workshops and pock-marked shooting ranges. The Dwarfs, too, have gigantic smelteries deep within their Dwarfholds, places of extreme heat and choking ash.Â 	false
building_flavour_texts_flavour_wh_main_dwf_resource_iron_4	The Miners' Guild looks after its members. There are no better miners in all the world than the Dwarfs, a boast that even the elgi struggle to challenge. The many Dwarfs in this profession are not afraid of a fight either, often forming ad hoc regiments to go to battle when the time comes. This combination of resilience and spontaneous bravery makes them a powerful ally of kings, as well as Dwarf and umgi traders. 	false
building_flavour_texts_flavour_wh_main_dwf_resource_iron_military	The secrets of puresteel, using techniques such as vertical filtering and experimental 'cyclone' furnaces, creating steel that is harder than anything the Empire can create in its own forges. This metal, known simply as 'puresteel' by the master smiths, is then used for creating the costliest and highest quality weapons in the Dwarfen arsenal, apart from Gromril of course. 	false
building_flavour_texts_flavour_wh_main_dwf_resource_marble_1	Dwarf stonecutters can slice through and shape stone as if it were wet clay. There is no race better at such work, although the High Elves are oft to challenge that assertion, claiming they were crafting stone and pottery of thousands of years before even the Dwarfs. Dawi craftspersons dismiss this as the jealous barbs of Elves - they know their wares are the world's finest. 	false
building_flavour_texts_flavour_wh_main_dwf_resource_marble_2	Quarries are used to mine stone, the most sought after being marble. Different parts of the Old World have different patinations - a greyish blue marble can be found near the Grey Mountains, while the around the foothills of Wurtbad there is a marble with distinctive green lines.	false
building_flavour_texts_flavour_wh_main_dwf_resource_marble_3	Masons are highly sought after, skilled craftsmen who chisel stone into wondrous creations. The Old World is full of grand edifices with mighty stone pillars or friezes of outstanding merit, often depicting holy symbols or the gods themselves. All are created by master masons.Â 	false
building_flavour_texts_flavour_wh_main_dwf_resource_marble_4	The Masons' Guild represents the ultimate in Dwarfen artifice. For thousands of years, they have fashioned the stonework of the Karaks, creating a distinctive, angular and geometric architectural style. The Guild halls of the stone masons are the epitome of such techniques and accomplishment.    	false
building_flavour_texts_flavour_wh_main_dwf_resource_pastures_1	Goat pastures are little more than mountainside shrubs and mossy boulders, yet goats thrive in such conditions - giving Dwarf shepherds a ready source of meat for sale at their local Holds. Dwarf Rangers are employed to keep an eye on goat pastures in order to ensure the Holdâ€™s herds are always protected.  	false
building_flavour_texts_flavour_wh_main_dwf_resource_pastures_2	In the high lands, Goat herds are much easier to maintain than cattle. As a result, Dwarfs are used to the taste of goat and over the years have developed many ways of cooking it. This mostly entails rigorous boiling to break down the animal's fibrous joints, although a good goat "kuri" is always welcome - especially when cooked by an experienced Dwarf maid or "kvinn". Kuri involves the use of rare and exotic spices to preserve the meat and give it a distinctive flavour that Dwarfs love - especially after more than a few ales!	false
building_flavour_texts_flavour_wh_main_dwf_resource_pastures_3	Dwarf farms are tended by Dawi, who prefer the outdoors to the confines of the mountain caverns. They are a strange breed, often viewed with suspicion by their more traditionally-minded kin. And yet without them, the Dwarfs within the Holds would have no meat for their stews, milk for their stinking cheeses, or even flour for their beloved stone bread!	false
building_flavour_texts_flavour_wh_main_dwf_resource_pastures_4	The Herders' Guild hall is usually close to the surface, away from the king's chambers, off the beaten path in one of the side tunnels where easy access to animal pens and mountain pastures is possible. The Guild's influence reflects the general Dwarfen attitude to those of their kin that spend much time above ground, i.e. very little.	false
building_flavour_texts_flavour_wh_main_dwf_resource_salt_1	Brine wells are often sunk in rocky areas, but anywhere there is a saltwater spring usually denotes a brine deposit. In the past, green-tinged brine has been mistakenly mined, and when used to season a hunk of beef or belly of pork has caused the consumer to erupt in nightmarish mutations!	false
building_flavour_texts_flavour_wh_main_dwf_resource_salt_2	Salt mines, like any kind of mining, is a perilous vocation, although Dwarfs are far better at it than most. The largest salt mines can be found near Nordberg in Ostland, and delve deep into the north-eastern face of the Middle Mountains where large deposits of pure salt rocks are found.	false
building_flavour_texts_flavour_wh_main_dwf_resource_salt_3	Salt works are often located near saltwater lakes or the coast. As well as having great grinding machinery for pulverising rock salt, as developed by the Dwarf Engineers' Guild or at the workshops in Altdorf, they may also contain salterns â€“ isolated saltwater bodies that use evaporation to filter the salt.Â 	false
building_flavour_texts_flavour_wh_main_dwf_resource_salt_4	Dwarfen tastes are far less refined than those of the elgi; they adore ale and they like stewed and roasted meats. That's about it. The only seasonings and spices they tend to appreciate are for bowls of 'kuri'. However, they do like a bit of salt - whether that's with their butter, sprinkled in their ale or indeed on their meat while it's roasting on the spit. In the Karaz Ankor, it is the Saltworkers' Guild that controls this commodity. 	false
building_flavour_texts_flavour_wh_main_dwf_resource_salt_military	Saltpeter, also known as 'darkland snow', is a special kind of salt that powdermakers have discovered can drastically increase the potency of black powder. It's also a key ingredient in cinderblast bombs and the ordnance used by the gyro-fleets. It is highly volatile so must be kept away from wrong or inexperienced hands. Separate, reinforced powder rooms are used to store it.   	false
building_flavour_texts_flavour_wh_main_dwf_resource_timber_1	Dwarf carpenters must rely on Empire merchants for a lot of their wood, as they live further away from the dense forests than manlings and certain kinds of strange elgi. However, Dwarfs have been known to lead expeditions of Rangers into forests near the mountainsides in search of prime lumber for their creations. 	false
building_flavour_texts_flavour_wh_main_dwf_resource_timber_2	There are many different types of wood that a timber mill can produce depending on its location. 'Reikland Sternoak' is often used in weapon hafts and for sturdy doors or even siege towers, while 'Hochland Beech Wood' is more workable and therefore suitable for furniture.Â Â 	false
building_flavour_texts_flavour_wh_main_dwf_resource_timber_3	Dwarfen lumberyards do not share the capacity of their Empire equivalents as demand, in general, is much lower, although the carpenters and coopers are always good and consistent customers. There is also a space issue - getting large pieces of lumber underground for storage is a lot less practical than keeping it in the open, but some of the larger Holds - such as Zhufbar - manage it anyway. 	false
building_flavour_texts_flavour_wh_main_dwf_resource_timber_4	Carpenters have large chips on their shoulders - a jest often repeated by factors from other Guilds, but one that is partially true. While stone masons and engineers get the most recognition for their fine works, carpenters are often in the background, fashioning all manner of things from wood, but generally taken for granted by all other Dwarfs.  	false
building_flavour_texts_flavour_wh_main_dwf_settlement_major_1	In its prime, the Dwarf Empire spread the length of the World's Edge Mountains. The great Holds were linked by myriad outposts â€“ from small mining concerns, remote mountain lodges and fortified breweries, to watch towers stationed above mountain passes that linked the perimeters of a Dwarfholdâ€™s dominion.     	false
building_flavour_texts_flavour_wh_main_dwf_settlement_major_2	While most Dwarfs abide in their great fastnesses, there are Clans who wish to find their fortune away from the influence of the established Holds. Perhaps hoping to discover a seam of ore in a mountainous area even the Karaz Ankor did not reach at its peak, they strike out in the hope of one day founding a Dwarfhold that can rival the great Kazaks.	false
building_flavour_texts_flavour_wh_main_dwf_settlement_major_3	While the Dwarfholds are the mightiest strongholds, the Karaz Ankor has many keeps within its realms. These are mountain fortresses that stand guard over entrances to the Underway or great sentinel bastions keeping a watchful eye on the mountain passes. Perhaps the most famous Dwarf keep is Karag Dromen, which overlooks Black Fire Pass.   	false
building_flavour_texts_flavour_wh_main_dwf_settlement_major_4	The Dwarfen Empire was built upon the strength of the Karaks, mighty strongholds that delve far underground into the roots of the mountains. For thousands of years they stood impregnable until the Age of Woe, when their enemies struck like never before. In the ensuing struggle, many Dwarfholds were lost to the hated Greenskins and other fell foes. 	false
building_flavour_texts_flavour_wh_main_dwf_settlement_major_5	Karak Kadrin - the Slayer Keep; Karak-A-Karaz - Everpeak - two legendary places even among the Great Holds of the Dwarfs. They are cities that occupy their fortified mountains from the very peak to deep under the roots of the world - places of vast halls of treasure, immense forges and a harsh beauty that would make any Son of Valaya swell with pride!	false
building_flavour_texts_flavour_wh_main_dwf_slayer_1	Dwarfs do not cope well with failure or personal tragedy. If such a fate befalls them, then there is every chance they will shave their heads, take their Ancestorâ€™s axe and join the Slayer Cult. Every Hold has a Slayer Shrine, where these forsaken Dwarfs look to Grimnir for aid in their next doom-seeking quest.  	false
building_flavour_texts_flavour_wh_main_dwf_slayer_2	Karak Kadrin is the great Hold of Ungrim Ironfist, the Slayer King. Ever since the days of King Baragor, it has been the location of the greatest Slayer Shrine, a massive monument to Grimnir which thousands of Slayers flock to every year. However, whilst Kadrin is undoubtedly the most important, many Holds have large Slayer populations. 	false
building_flavour_texts_flavour_wh_main_dwf_smith_1	No Dwarf worth his beard leaves his axe out of his sight, but when heavier weaponry is called for it can be found in the Holdâ€™s armoury. Such places are have achieve almost mythical status among other races; tales are told of racks upon racks of gleaming Gromril armour and rows of mattocks and double-headed battle axes that line the walls, every blade thrumming with runic power.	false
building_flavour_texts_flavour_wh_main_dwf_smith_2	Only the Dwarfs have the lore to shape Gromril. Known to others as star-metal, it is the rarest of all ores, and treasured by the Dwarfs for its superior qualities. Gromril makes the best armour, the sharpest axes and is the most supple material for combining with runes. To unleash its power, a Hold needs a forge of meteoric iron. 	false
building_flavour_texts_flavour_wh_main_dwf_smith_3	A Dwarfhold will have countless forges and smelters within its endless halls, but a Runesmith will only deign to work at a runeforge. Such places have been properly prepared with runes of power and warding, blessed by priests of Valaya, and house a raging fire within - a flame that burns bright and pure.	false
building_flavour_texts_flavour_wh_main_dwf_tavern_1	Dwarfholds are generally vast, but even the smallest strongholds contain numerous drinking halls - drinking being one of the Dwarfs' major pastimes. Refectories are interspersed throughout the deeps, allowing those Dwarfs who are on duty - or who are too far underground - to reach the grander halls for the purposes of refreshment and to drench their beards in ale.	false
building_flavour_texts_flavour_wh_main_dwf_tavern_2	Dwarfen drinking halls are always packed with red-faced and wet-bearded Dwarfs, there to quaff large quantities of ale from tankards as large as their axes. As the fire roars in its grate, the drinking gives way to contests of girth and beard length, poetry and singing. Dwarf singing is raucous and grating, yet a joy to hear - especially when it's a rousing chorus of "She Was Only a Halflingâ€™s Daughter"! 	false
building_flavour_texts_flavour_wh_main_dwf_tavern_3	Feasting is a very important and social event in any Dwarfhold. Kings entertain envoys and other royalty in their grand feasting halls, where course after course of roasted meat and an endless supply of beer is provided. Naturally, guests are expected to keep up with the appetites of their hosts, as should they flounder then offence maybe caused and doubt cast upon the lightweight's character!	false
building_flavour_texts_flavour_wh_main_dwf_trade_depot_1	The Guilds have special areas in the higher deeps that receive goods from all over the Karaz Ankor. These depots are effectively inland ports, acting as offloading areas for trade caravans bringing in hops, goats, leather, and bolts of cloth, gems, ores as well as various other merchandise. The depot inevitably has a bustling atmosphere as Guild factors haggle over the prices - decrying the goods of one trader whilst insulting the Ancestor of another, and all the while promoting the quality of their own Guildâ€™s output.	false
building_flavour_texts_flavour_wh_main_dwf_trade_depot_2	The larger Karaks will have a bustling market area usually attached to or part of the trade depot. This is a busy part of the Hold, the centre of commerce for that entire region, full of Guild agents and trading factors making deals. Along the sides of the marketplace are numerous refectories serving beer to the stevedores and caravan drivers as they prepare to take loads onto to the next Hold. It is also not uncommon in the largest of Dwarfholds, such as Everpeak and Barak Varr, for there to be non-Dwarfen traders - manlings and Elves will often visit the market to strike deals with the Guilds directly.	false
building_flavour_texts_flavour_wh_main_dwf_wall_1	Unlike the settlements of man, Dwarfholds have no use of walls for they are fashioned from the mountains themselves. Gates, however, are integral to a strongholdâ€™s defence. A good, solid gate at a Hold's entrance makes all the difference.	false
building_flavour_texts_flavour_wh_main_dwf_wall_2	The Dwarfs keep a close eye on all who cross the threshold of their homes, but for the most part their gates remain open. However, should an enemy come, then the gates â€“ reinforced by steel, or even Gromril in the case of Karaz-A-Karak â€“ will close so no army can enter - not from the surface in any event.	false
building_flavour_texts_flavour_wh_main_dwf_wall_3	The mightiest Dwarfholds have their momentous gates protected by unusual materials whose use is anything but the norm elsewhere in the Old World. Runelords inscribe these gates with runes fashioned by Valaya, the Goddess of Heath and Home, herself!	false
building_flavour_texts_flavour_wh_main_dwf_workshop_1	Amidst the saw dust and wood shavings and banging of carpentry, the Dwarfs create many things from wood and stone. The largest of these are the Grudge Throwers, catapults that lob shaped stones at the enemyâ€™s walls or army. Each stone has inscribed a grudge or insult carved with letters in the Klinkarhun.  	false
building_flavour_texts_flavour_wh_main_dwf_workshop_2	The powder hall is a part of the Hold not visited often by those who do not work there, for should a naked flame be brought in then the chances of survival are small. Along the blackened walls are many barrels that contain the ingredients for black powder, which, when formulated, is used to power the most deadly weapons in the Dwarf arsenal. 	false
building_flavour_texts_flavour_wh_main_dwf_workshop_3	The Dwarfs are the undisputed masters of smithing. Deep in the Holds are the forges of these master smiths, containing great furnaces that burn hotter than the stars. Only the Dwarfs themselves could hope to work in such conditions - no man could and an Elf would simply wilt!	false
building_flavour_texts_flavour_wh_main_dwf_workshop_4	As even the most traditionalist Holds grudgingly look upon the "innovative" gyro-machines as a force for the good of the Karaz Ankor, thoughts have turned to how to launch them at speed. Zhufbar was the first to hollow out the highest peaks into a hanger for the Dwarfen air-fleet and others soon followed, even fortifying the sky entrances with flame cannons lest an invader choose that vector for attack.	false
building_flavour_texts_flavour_wh_main_emp_barracks_1	Large, pock-marked fields are used to train men. First and foremost they learn discipline â€“ with a Sergeant barking orders at ranks of spears and swordsmen until he is red in the face. Once regiments can act as cohesive units, then they may stand a chance against mankindâ€™s many foes.	false
building_flavour_texts_flavour_wh_main_emp_barracks_2	The Empireâ€™s armies are blessedly large, for it is discipline and numbers that form the bulwark of its might. The rally fields are where these mighty formations of troops â€“ from Swordsmen to Halberdiers and Crossbowmen â€“ muster and then march out to face their foes.   	false
building_flavour_texts_flavour_wh_main_emp_barracks_3	The Elector Counts all need to ensure they have a battle-ready defence at any time, a barracks that houses the majority of state troops. More prestigious regiments, such as Greatswords, may have their own wing of the barracks or even a separate quarters, earned for their prowess in battle.  	false
building_flavour_texts_flavour_wh_main_emp_farm_basic_1	Crops of any kind are hard to grow in the Old World. A hostile climate is but one obstacle, but there is also the constant footfall of armies trampling over any hard-won harvest. Yet lack of supply certainly doesnâ€™t create demand, the grain that does make it to market, is depressed in price with the population attaching more value to cold steel than food.         	false
building_flavour_texts_flavour_wh_main_emp_farm_basic_2	To be a farmer is a trial as perilous as any soldierâ€™s career. The weather in the Old World is unpredictable and tainted by Chaos â€“ it may rain teeth as well as water. Then, often far from the relative safety of the towns and villages, there are bandits and other fell things to deal withâ€¦ 	false
building_flavour_texts_flavour_wh_main_emp_farm_basic_3	While the Empire is vast, much of it lies under a dense forest canopy. Where the sun is allowed to touch the ground, agriculture is a priority. Landed estates are noble-owned farms of prodigious acreage, producing many tonnes of arable crops for the markets. 	false
building_flavour_texts_flavour_wh_main_emp_forges_1	While any blacksmith can hammer out a horse shoe, there are only a few that have been taught at the Gunnery School of Nuln to fashion gun and artillery barrels. To keep their prices high, the Gunsmithâ€™s Guild jealously guards its secrets, such as how to cool the barrels upright and rifling inside them so shots fire straight! 	false
building_flavour_texts_flavour_wh_main_emp_forges_2	The Empireâ€™s foundries are huge, hot and acrid places â€“ topped by vast, ash-spilling chimneys, where blackpowder weapons are smelted and manufactured. Many foundries can be found in Altdorf around the Engineerâ€™s School, but Nuln is also well served to keep the Imperial Gunnery School stocked with Great Cannons.	false
building_flavour_texts_flavour_wh_main_emp_forges_3	An Engineerâ€™s workshop is a treasure trove of failed experiments and bizarre inventions. The vast majority of these are liable to cause more harm than good on the battlefield. Occasionally, though, a Master Engineer will develop something that can even rival the artifice of the Dwarfs. Leonardoâ€™s Steam Tank is one such example. 	false

building_flavour_texts_flavour_wh_main_emp_garrison_1	Guard houses are effectively small bases and mustering stations for the settlementâ€™s guards. These may be state troops on defensive duty, older veterans or even young â€™uns not quite ready for full investment in the local regiment.  	false
building_flavour_texts_flavour_wh_main_emp_garrison_2	While partial to the odd bribe, a City Watch is generally a boon to the town or city it patrols â€“ stamping down on crime not sanctioned by the local Guild of Shadows but also ensuring order in the teeming streets. Should the settlement come under threat from outside forces then hopefully the Watch will band together for its defence! 	false
building_flavour_texts_flavour_wh_main_emp_garrison_3	Garrisons are great military stations. A permanent edifice where the Emperorâ€™s armies gather ready to be deployed across the vast nation, but also a ready pool of professional defenders to protect the town or city when the enemies of Sigmar dare to attack. 	false
building_flavour_texts_flavour_wh_main_emp_industry_basic_1	The Weavers' Guild is surprisingly powerful. Even the Burgomeisters are cautious around weavers, for the people of the Empire love their clothes, and so fabrics are produced by them on an industrial scale. Often, machines created by master engineers are used that have resulted in many deaths, usually when a young apprentice falls into the machinery!  	false
building_flavour_texts_flavour_wh_main_emp_industry_basic_2	Clothing is an important status symbol in the Empire; generally the higher up your social status and wealth, the frillier and more ostentatious your garments. While a simple Hochlander will get by in a plain shirt, those who attend court with the Countess at Nuln would never dream of being seen without bulging sleeves! 	false
building_flavour_texts_flavour_wh_main_emp_industry_basic_3	In the eyes of the wealthy and privileged, a tailored wardrobe is essential for appearances at court and even on the battlefield. No Graf of good standing would be seen in the same attire in two battles in a row and so the tailors of the more affluent districts are always busy! 	false
building_flavour_texts_flavour_wh_main_emp_port_1	While Dwarfs carve quays out of solid rock, the Orcs and Norse have little more than wooden planks that jut into the sea. Empire wharfs - including those in Sylvania - are generally much sturdier. Since much of their trade comes down the large rivers they need reliable platforms of timber and stone to enable their ships to dock.	false
building_flavour_texts_flavour_wh_main_emp_port_2	There are many harbours in the Old World, as the nations oft use the large flowing rivers to transport goods from one place to another. Even the Empire's great inland cities have some kind of harbour for massive river barges to dock. The most famous of all harbours, perhaps, is in Barak Varr, the sea-gate of the Karaz Ankor. 	false
building_flavour_texts_flavour_wh_main_emp_port_3	Erengrad, Marienburg, Altdorf, Barak Varr, even the Orc pirate forts that riddle the coast by the Dragonback mountains are all built around or contain a series of ports. These are normally places that attract wealth, as they are great trading stations in those rare moments when there is a lull in the eternal war and also home to the fleet when it returns.	false
building_flavour_texts_flavour_wh_main_emp_resource_dyes_1	Cinnabar shafts not controlled by the Dwarfs are almost always owned by the Gold College, who need a constant supply of mercury for their acolytes' many experiments in alchemy. However, the Dye-makers' Guild also needs blood rock to get a very distinctive shade of crimson for use in garments, thus Cinnabar is in demand.   	false
building_flavour_texts_flavour_wh_main_emp_resource_dyes_2	When the Dye-makers' Guild discovered that the Gold College had effectively monopolised the worldâ€™s supply of blood rock, these two disparate organisations effectively went to war. Free Companies of Guild apprentices laid siege to the cinnabar mines in Wissenland, the stockade only falling when a coterie of Gold Wizards appeared and turned the besiegers into statues!	false
building_flavour_texts_flavour_wh_main_emp_resource_dyes_3	Those who work with dye rarely live to a good age, for they deal in acrid liquids and other foul brews to create colours for garments. This is done in order to keep up with the rapacious fashions of clashing colours that dominate the various courts of the Empire, Bretonnia, and especially Tilea. It is not for nothing that Tilean Princes are known as peacocks!	false
building_flavour_texts_flavour_wh_main_emp_resource_furs_1	The Empire has many accomplished archers in its ranks but none are more skilled than the Huntsmen. They typically hail from the more rural regions such as Ostland or Hochland and are extremely capable of hunting game birds, stags and even Jabberslythes in the dense forest of the Drakwald.	false
building_flavour_texts_flavour_wh_main_emp_resource_furs_2	In areas where there is a good supply of game, hunting lodges are built as a useful base in which to store kills before they are taken back to civilisation. Lodges are rarely occupied on a constant basis, so when the season begins hunters have to make sure they are clear of other things that may have taken residence during the Winter months...	false
building_flavour_texts_flavour_wh_main_emp_resource_furs_3	A tannery takes the skins of animals and subjects them to a process called liming. This toughens and preserves the skin, turning it into leather. A tanner will also preserve pelts by using a salting, oiling and waxing process. The odours these processes create are vile, so tanneries are usually located downstream or in the poorest districts of a city.   	false
building_flavour_texts_flavour_wh_main_emp_resource_gold_1	The Dwarfs discovered gold long ago when the Karaz Ankor was still young. Even now, it has a strange hold over Dwarfen hearts, infecting them with an interminable greed or â€˜gold sicknessâ€™ in extreme cases. Yet they remain the masters of extracting it from rock, although man-made mines have found plenty of rich seams in recent times.Â 	false
building_flavour_texts_flavour_wh_main_emp_resource_gold_2	The only reliable way to find gold is to unearth it from the ground using mine works. This is still the case, despite numerous attempts by the Gold College to transmute it from lead. Even the Supreme Patriarch, Balthasar Gelt, cannot make gold this way, although he has been known to place a glamour on lead to make it look like gold for a short time, when neededâ€¦   	false
building_flavour_texts_flavour_wh_main_emp_resource_gold_3	Like any forge, a gold smelter is a hot and horrid place to work. Unsurprisingly, the Dwarfs are better at it than most, able to withstand the temperatures and still produce bars free of imperfections and uniform in shape. A seasoned Dwarf smelter will find employ beyond the Karaz Ankor, in the realms of men.	false
building_flavour_texts_flavour_wh_main_emp_resource_iron_1	While more exotic metals such as Gromril are highly prized, and searched for with obsessive determination by the Dwarfs, it is iron that turns the wheels of industry. From iron comes steel, the foundation material of countless objects from blades to war machines to steam-powered tanks.	false
building_flavour_texts_flavour_wh_main_emp_resource_iron_2	Mining was first taught to man by the Dwarfs, who were delving deep into the mountains long before humans mastered fire. These days, mines are found anywhere where ore is discovered. For instance, the Worldâ€™s Edge Mountains have long been rich in iron seams, and their supply shows no sign of being exhausted.	false
building_flavour_texts_flavour_wh_main_emp_resource_iron_3	The largest smelters in the Empire are in Nuln. Here, the Imperial Gunnery School stretches across an entire district - a warren of forges, gunsmithsâ€™ workshops and pock-marked gun ranges. The Dwarfs, too, have gigantic smelting facilities deep within their Dwarfholds, places of extreme heat and choking ash. 	false
building_flavour_texts_flavour_wh_main_emp_resource_iron_military	To be a master swordsmith takes many years of perfecting your skill to hone blades to their sharpest edges. These men are no mere blacksmiths, they are swordmakers for kings and emperors and can command a hefty price for their services. 	false
building_flavour_texts_flavour_wh_main_emp_resource_marble_1	Quarries are used to mine stone and marble in particular, as it is the most sought-after kind in all the Old World. In each of the regions in which it is found the stone has different patinations â€“ a greyish blue near the Grey Mountains, while marble from foothills of Wurtbad it has a distinctive green line running through it.	false
building_flavour_texts_flavour_wh_main_emp_resource_marble_2	Once marble has been quarried, it is cut into manageable blocks by stone cutters. The Witch Hunters have kept an eye on the Stone Cutters' Guild ever since Carlos Marezus, a skilled Estalian marblesmith, was discovered to have placed hidden carvings of ruinous marks on the stones he sold. 	false
building_flavour_texts_flavour_wh_main_emp_resource_marble_3	Masons are highly sought-after, skilled craftsmen who chisel stone into wondrous creations. The Old World is full of grand edifices with mighty stone pillars or friezes of outstanding merit, often depicting holy symbols or the Gods themselves. All are created by master masons. 	false
building_flavour_texts_flavour_wh_main_emp_resource_pastures_1	While the word "pasture" may conjure up some sun-drenched meadow, this is usually far from the truth. Squalid fields with little grass are all a smallholder can hope for. Even they must be defended against the ever-encroaching forest, for the Empire is primarily woodland and the trees do not give ground easily! 	false
building_flavour_texts_flavour_wh_main_emp_resource_pastures_2	While smallholders farming a tiny tract of land with a miserable little herd will be lucky to have a shelter at all, larger farms may even manage a barn or two. Better kept animals will produce more milk and higher quality meat, unless of course the farm is raided, destroyed by invading armies or taxed out of existence â€“ all of which are common occurrences!	false
building_flavour_texts_flavour_wh_main_emp_resource_pastures_3	Soldiers cannot march on empty stomachs, and so large cattle farming operations are needed to prevent famine and make a hefty profit for their owners too. The more industrial-scale farms are almost always owned by the nobility, but an increasing few have come under the sway of Burgomeisters as well.    	false
building_flavour_texts_flavour_wh_main_emp_resource_pastures_military	The most famous warhorse breeders have clients stretching across Bretonnia, Knightly Orders in the Empire and the vain princelings of Tilea. Their horses are the finest, their foals quickly snapped up by the highest bidders or by Royal decree. By far their most common customers are Bretonnian Knights, who can get through several horses a year if they are not careful! 	false
building_flavour_texts_flavour_wh_main_emp_resource_pottery_1	Pots, pans, cups, utensils and many other things are usually made from wood or clay, the raw material of which is garnered from ground. The clay-laden earth around northern Stirland and along the Sylvanian border provides the Empire with much of its supply, but this very much depends on whether the Undead are active there.	false
building_flavour_texts_flavour_wh_main_emp_resource_pottery_2	A potter works, often obsessively, in creating all manner of earthenware on his wheel. Pottery workshops are crammed with it, including merchandise that has been baked and is ready for sale, alongside items that are still wet and waiting to be taken to the local kiln for firing. 	false
building_flavour_texts_flavour_wh_main_emp_resource_pottery_3	While the primary use of kilns - large brick ovens with funnelling chimneys - is to harden the clay creations of potters, the Witch Hunters have also made use of them in the past. The Order of the Silver Hammer is one for economy, so when persecuting a witch why build a burning pyre when the local kiln will do just as well?   	false
building_flavour_texts_flavour_wh_main_emp_resource_salt_1	Salt mines, like any kind of mining in the world, is a perilous vocation - although the Dwarfs are far better at it than most. The largest salt mines can be found near Nordberg in Ostland and delve deep into the north-eastern face of the Middle Mountains, where large deposits of pure salt rocks can be found. 	false
building_flavour_texts_flavour_wh_main_emp_resource_salt_2	Salt mines, like any kind of mining in the world, is a perilous vocation - although the Dwarfs are far better at it than most.

building_flavour_texts_flavour_wh_main_emp_resource_salt_3	Salt works are often located near saltwater lakes or the coast. As well as having great grinding machinery for pulverising rock salt, as developed by the Dwarf Engineers' Guild or at the workshops in Altdorf, they may also contain salterns â€“ isolated saltwater bodies that use evaporation to filter it. 	false
building_flavour_texts_flavour_wh_main_emp_resource_timber_1	A woodsman gambles with his life whenever he enters a forest to collect wood. It is not just the creatures that lurk within that he needs to be wary of, but the very trees themselves. Venom thickets, corrupted trees and grasping blood vines are just some of the flora that make this an extremely hazardous occupation. 	false
building_flavour_texts_flavour_wh_main_emp_resource_timber_2	There are many different types of wood that a timber mill can produce, depending on its location. Reikland Sternoak is often used for weapon shafts and for sturdy doors or even siege towers, while Hochland Beech Wood is more workable and therefore suitable for furniture.   	false
building_flavour_texts_flavour_wh_main_emp_resource_timber_3	Like so many things in the Empire, it is the merchant cartels and the Burgomeisters that control the wood trade. This allows them to throttle supply and create demand in certain areas, or over-supply the market to drive down the cost should they need to. Thusly, the rich stay rich and the poor stay desperate...	false
building_flavour_texts_flavour_wh_main_emp_resource_timber_military	A woodworker's shop will be a trove of furniture - tables, chairs, lecterns and their like, the quality of which depends on whether, for instance, Sternoak from Hochland or a good old Drakwald timber are used. Of course, things made from weirwood, or the dark trees of Sylvania, may have "other" characteristics... 	false
building_flavour_texts_flavour_wh_main_emp_resource_wine_1	The art of winemaking was gifted to man from the Elves. While the swill created by tiny producers is lacking in flavour, it nevertheless finds customers - usually being bought and watered down by unscrupulous landlords in the Empire's more disreputable establishments.  	false
building_flavour_texts_flavour_wh_main_emp_resource_wine_2	The Elves are the true masters of winemaking, yet there are a few human nations that have established vineyards with long-standing reputations. However, just as the Dwarfs think the ale of men weak and flavourless, so do the Elves consider even the most expensive Bretonnian wine insipid and characterless. 	false
building_flavour_texts_flavour_wh_main_emp_resource_wine_3	Wine is sold throughout the human realms, but wonâ€™t be touched by Dwarfs who despise the whole concept. Unsurprisingly, Elves think the human version inferior to their own blends too, yet there is a large profit to be made in rarer vintages when, despite the wars and unpredictable weather, the grapes grew to perfection.  	false
building_flavour_texts_flavour_wh_main_emp_settlement_major_1	Hamlets are small settlements, often no more than two or three buildings clumped together. They will usually form around farmsteads, coaching inns, crossroads or bridges â€“ places where foot traffic is common and Roadwardens occasional pass through. They cling to the Emperorâ€™s highways, offering pin-pricks of civilisation amidst the unforgiving forest.	false
building_flavour_texts_flavour_wh_main_emp_settlement_major_2	The wilderness of the Empire is untamed; those who do not farm the land congregate in the towns and villages for reasons of trade and safety. They range from large hamlets to walled settlements that are towns in all but name.	false
building_flavour_texts_flavour_wh_main_emp_settlement_major_3	Towns are larger settlements which offer greater mercantile opportunities, often with an organised watch to hopefully man the walls should Beastmen emerge from the forest. The Empireâ€™s penchant for eccentric buildings and non-existent urban planning sees the towns sprawl beyond the original walls and into squalid foulburgs, where the poorest dwell.	false
building_flavour_texts_flavour_wh_main_emp_settlement_major_4	Those who do not eke out a living in the perilous countryside will most likely reside in the Empireâ€™s cities. While you are safer within the city walls, they are far from being havens. Unscrupulous nobles, criminal Guilds, sinister neighbourhoods and many other dangers face the unwary in this unsettling urban landscape.	false
building_flavour_texts_flavour_wh_main_emp_settlement_major_5	The city-states, of which there are few, are massive conurbations â€“ great urban environments containing the full gamut of the strange and bizarre, from artillery schools, menageries of grotesque beasts to eldritch colleges of learning. Altdorf, Nuln and Middenheim are the most famous of these great cities, as was Marienburg before it infamously seceded from the Empire in 2429. 	false
building_flavour_texts_flavour_wh_main_emp_smiths_1	Blacksmiths in the provinces â€“ and, indeed, the Old World â€“ fashion more than just horseshoes. Arms, armour, talismans, swords and countless other blades are hammered and shaped under a blacksmithâ€™s hammer - for the industry of the Empire is war. 	false
building_flavour_texts_flavour_wh_main_emp_smiths_2	For a nation constantly involved in one war or another, having a ready supply of weaponry is crucial, and armouries are such places. Often attached to garrisons, barracks and chapter houses, they contain racks upon racks of halberds, swords, lances and myriad other arms, as well as a forge and wet stones to keep the weapons in good condition.      	false
building_flavour_texts_flavour_wh_main_emp_stables_1	The Imperial stables are more than just a place to house horses. They are also great yards where destriers are matched with young nobles and trained, until the rider can shoot his pistols from the saddle with a degree of competency. 	false
building_flavour_texts_flavour_wh_main_emp_stables_2	The grand liveries attached to the chapter houses of the Knightly Orders house the great warhorses that the Knights ride upon. They are more akin to temples than stables, as a Knight honours his mount nearly as much as his god - for he needs both when charging into battle.  	false
building_flavour_texts_flavour_wh_main_emp_stables_3	The zoos and menageries of the Empire are rare institutions. Only the largest and prosperous of cities have them, the most famous example being the Imperial Zoo in Altdorf - home to a Dragon, many Pegasi and, of course, Deathclaw â€“ the personal mount of Karl Franz.  	false
building_flavour_texts_flavour_wh_main_emp_tavern_1	Tap rooms are, by their very nature, small drinking holes, and often very rough and ready in appearance - both the places and their patrons. Tap rooms by and large sell mannish brews â€“ ales that a Dwarf would scorn as "cat piss", yet do the job for the weaker constitutions of men. 	false
building_flavour_texts_flavour_wh_main_emp_tavern_2	Taverns vary in size and quality throughout the Old World. Food is often an option, and again its quality can vary greatly - from bread with hard cheese that even rats shun to great hearty stews prepared by the in-demand Halfling cooks. But it is the beer that keeps a tavernâ€™s regulars returning, with some establishments even stocking a selection of Dwarfish ales. 	false
building_flavour_texts_flavour_wh_main_emp_tavern_3	Inns almost always offer food as well as a selection of ales and spirits. They are usually large, multi-storied buildings that, if located outside a town along a lonesome road, will be fortified to dissuade bandits (and worse) from attacking - although this hasnâ€™t always stopped such occurrences in the past!	false
building_flavour_texts_flavour_wh_main_emp_walls_1	Larger hamlets, villages and small towns will have some barrier in place to protect them from the wilderness. Of course, a basic wall must be manned to be effective or else the foe will just climb right over - slowing them down but not stopping them. 	false
building_flavour_texts_flavour_wh_main_emp_walls_2	It is rare that a town in the Empire is not fortified; protected by a high â€“ although, often crumbling â€“ wall of stone. In addition to the physical structure, icons of power are mixed in the mortar that bonds the blocks and runes etched on the outer side to protect against the incursion of unholy foes.	false
building_flavour_texts_flavour_wh_main_emp_walls_3	The walls of Altdorf, Wolfenburg and Averheim have rarely been breached such is their scale. They are riddled with walkways, murder holes, buttresses and vast ramparts. They will be warded with eldritch icons to protect from the arcane as well as the mundane. Yet no matter how grand or solid the foundations, walls can only be effective when there are men to guard them.	false
building_flavour_texts_flavour_wh_main_emp_wizards_1	Conclaves are ephemeral gatherings â€“ often in places of latent power â€“ where Wizards from the Eight Colleges will meet to discuss the affairs of the nation or to air rivalries common amongst the Orders. Itâ€™s also a place where mages bring the concerns of mundane folk to their kin to decide if action should be taken. 	false
building_flavour_texts_flavour_wh_main_emp_wizards_2	The Colleges of Magic are the headquarters and primary training ground for Battle Wizards across the Empire. The buildings themselves often mirror the Order they represent â€“ the Gold College is a massive forge on the banks of the Reik, for example â€“ and while they are located in Altdorf, there are smaller campuses in other cities.   	false
building_flavour_texts_flavour_wh_main_emp_wizards_3	After the Great War Against Chaos, when the myriad legions of the Ruinous Powers spilled into the Old World from the desolate Chaos Wastes, the victorious Magnus the Pious - the first elected Emperor for many centuries and the man who re-unified the Empire - lifted the ban on the practise of Wizardry and founded the Colleges of Magic in Altdorf. While graduate Battle Wizards tend to settle in all corners of the Empire following their varsity years, they live secluded lives - as magic-users are mostly shunned by the ignorant, common folk. As such, they choose to occupy the abandoned follies and towers scattered throughout the land, where they can conduct their magical experiments in peace.	false
building_flavour_texts_flavour_wh_main_emp_worship_1	After fifty years on the throne, the first Emperor, Sigmar, laid down his crown and travelled east. He was never seen as a mere mortal again. In the following years he became revered â€“ the Man-God of the Empire. Shrines spread across the land and the Cult of Sigmar was formed. 	false
building_flavour_texts_flavour_wh_main_emp_worship_2	Temples are far larger edifices than chapels and shrines. It is here that Warrior Priests preach the virtues of Sigmar and deliver fiery sermons in his glorious name. There are many other gods within the Old World, such as Ulric and Morr, but it is to Sigmar that the people of the Empire look in times of dire need.	false
building_flavour_texts_flavour_wh_main_emp_worship_3	The cathedrals are massive buildings attended by many Warrior Priests. The largest of these sits in Altdorf; a grand palace of worship, it is octagonal in shape and built at the place where Sigmar was crowned. It is here that sermons are delivered by the Arch Lectors or the Grand Theogonist himself. 	false
building_flavour_texts_flavour_wh_main_grn_boars_1	The stench surrounding a boar sty can make even the hardest Bossâ€™ eyes water. Goblins are sent in to shovel the crap away, onto the settlementâ€™s dung pile or to fertilise the fungus patches. But a Goblin with a spade is no match for a territorial boar; wiser bosses could probably send in a "cleaning krew" when the sty is unoccupied, but where would the fun be in that? 	false
building_flavour_texts_flavour_wh_main_grn_boars_2	Even the Orcs, whose concept of animal husbandry is non-existent, realise that placing all their boar sties in one location keeps the vile stench in one place. The downside to this is that war boars, being the bad-tempered porcines that they are, despise each other. They squeal with rage at being so close to each other and this, mixed with the aforementioned odour, makes a boar farm a truly vile place.	false
building_flavour_texts_flavour_wh_main_grn_boss_1	As befits their elevated status, Big Bosses get big tents. They usually get them by taking over the tent of the previous Big Boss. The reason why the previous Big Boss is not in the tent may be because he died in battle, but more likely heâ€™s dead in a ditch, probably near "da drops", with a rather large knife wound in his back. 	false
building_flavour_texts_flavour_wh_main_grn_boss_2	As Bosses grow in power, they gain more followers, add more to the tribeâ€™s pile of shiny stuff, and get more privileges - such as their own shack. By the standards of other races, this is still barely a building, but for the Greenskins, it is an impressive sight and one that marks the owner as "goinâ€™ places". 	false
building_flavour_texts_flavour_wh_main_grn_boss_3	A Boss that can mark out his own camp within a Greenskin settlement is powerful. The Greenskins have a crude political system compared to the partisan games played at the courts of Altdorf and Ulthuan, yet even the simplest Orc knows that a camp guarded by its own Big â€˜Uns is led by a Boss that should be respected. 	false
building_flavour_texts_flavour_wh_main_grn_dwf_port_ruin	There are many ruins within the Old World and beyond. Even in the Empire - the heart of civilisation - there are strange, ruined cities, their original inhabitants lost to time. In the Badlands lies Morgheim, once known as Mourkain, the capital of the Strygos Empire and now an infamous ruin. Of course, even further south, are the sand-scoured Tomb Cities of Khemri... 	false
building_flavour_texts_flavour_wh_main_grn_dwf_settlement_ruin_major	The World's Edge Mountains are scattered with the remnants of lost Dwarfen kingdoms. Karak Dum, Karak Varn and some say, even the lost of Hold of Karak Zorn, lie in ruins - cracked open by Greenskins and other enemies of the Dwarfs. Yet even the Goblins and their larger kin have had setbacks occupying such vast fastnesses, and have lost many of the Holds they stole from the Dwarfs.	false

building_flavour_texts_flavour_wh_main_grn_farm_1	The idolz are a constant reminder that Gork's gaze or Mork's feet are ever-present. Orcs will come and head-butt the idolz in respect; Goblins tend to throw mutilated limbs of former mates or enemies at them for the same reasons; Shamans will dance round them uttering nonsense - nonsense that the gods seem to like nevertheless!	false
building_flavour_texts_flavour_wh_main_grn_farm_2	Like the idolz, totems are important to the Greenskins' worship. The faces that make up the pole are not just the gods, but the settlement's Boss and the foes he has vanquished. 	false
building_flavour_texts_flavour_wh_main_grn_farm_3	Choppas, blades and the skulls of vanquished foes are placed at the base of the Boss' pole to become part of the tribute. Jealous Orcs caught tampering' with the Boss' pole suffer terrible punishments - their skulls soon joining the others!	false
building_flavour_texts_flavour_wh_main_grn_forest_beasts_1	Denz vary greatly in size and location depending on the settlement in question. Some wolves are kept in deep caves along with the Squigs, while in other places ramshackle shelters are built for wolf packs. Goblins have learnt - often at great personal cost - that the best way to keep wolves close is to dump a great deal of meat into their denz. The "meat" will most likely be chopped up prisoners, but occasionally it will be a gobbo who foolishly crossed the kennul-master!	false
building_flavour_texts_flavour_wh_main_grn_forest_beasts_2	The web-covered, twisted boughs of trees deep in the forest are a sure sign of spider lairs. The Forest Goblins call these gloomy hollowz and with good reason, for Wolf-Spiders, Great Body-Burrowers, Blue Skullbacks and myriad other giant arachnid species nest there. Other types make the dank caves deep underground their home. 	false
building_flavour_texts_flavour_wh_main_grn_forest_beasts_3	Instead of fleeing from the deepwood behemoths, Forest Goblin tribes began to purposefully seek out and encamp near Arachnarok lairs. There the tribe proffer the beasts sacrifices and use Shamans to coax the creatures away from the sacred spider groundz and towards the enemy.   	false
building_flavour_texts_flavour_wh_main_grn_garrison_1	Watch Towers allow Greenskins to "keep an eye on fings" not happening in the immediate vicinity of the settlement. Goblins have keener eyesight and are better at heights so are more suited to the role, although they get bored easily, and frequently end up either flinging each other off or sitting around singing about Trolls in the Pantry and rarely actually doing any watchinâ€™!	false
building_flavour_texts_flavour_wh_main_grn_garrison_2	Orc Guard Houses range from shacks close to important locations in the camp, such as gates or chambers set aside to keep the Bossâ€™ pile of shiny stuff safe. Itâ€™s a dull job, when all you want to really do is bash the enemy; but some fool has to do it. On the plus side, you get to sit in the guard house picking bogies out of your nose.	false
building_flavour_texts_flavour_wh_main_grn_garrison_3	A Big â€˜Un garrison generally makes the local, belligerent populace behave, or at least stop bashing each other up so much. Theyâ€™re also there to stop any thieving gits, be they Greenskin or not, by putting a heavy choppa in the interlopers' heads.	false
building_flavour_texts_flavour_wh_main_grn_industry_1	A pile is a moderately good mound of valuables. A Boss may fling some to his Big 'Uns and closest mates, with the rest used as a status symbol. The bigga the pile of shiny stuff, the more successful the Boss is judged to be. 	false
building_flavour_texts_flavour_wh_main_grn_industry_2	If a Boss gets a whole heap of shiny stuff then news will travel fast and other Orcs and Goblins may think it's worth havin' a gander to see just how rich this Boss is gonna get!	false
building_flavour_texts_flavour_wh_main_grn_industry_3	Hoards are rarely just left in the open, they'll be put in a vault or, in the absence of such a secure area, the Boss may well place his "throne" (normally just a big chair) on top of the hoard so he can look down upon supplicants who come before him. 	false
building_flavour_texts_flavour_wh_main_grn_military_1	Musta fieldz are usually any area that the Boss likes to gather his boyz for a good shoutinâ€™. When the brawlinâ€™ is done, the lads might get round to some choppa practice or some stabbinâ€™ if the gobbos are havinâ€™ a go. Inevitably, "practice" will turn into something more brutal and deadly when one of the boyz "accidently" connects with another.	false
building_flavour_texts_flavour_wh_main_grn_military_2	Be it an empty underground hall that stunties used to store their gold in or a large space marked by Idols on the plains, the brawlinâ€™ groundz are an important area only the most inconsiderate of Bosses would shun. This is where Orcs gather in large numbers for a fight and to improve their "swagga".  	false
building_flavour_texts_flavour_wh_main_grn_military_3	The fightinâ€™ pits are for Orcs to "'ave it out wiv each ovver". The strongest, toughest and most scarred Orcs (and the occasional Goblin drunk on mushroom brew) go into the pit for a serious fight against a ferocious opponent, with only one coming back out. On occasion the Boss himself has jumped into the pit after being challenged. The challenger usually only emerging as a disembodied head to be stuck on the Boss pole.   	false
building_flavour_texts_flavour_wh_main_grn_military_4	Black Orcs are not interested in the frivolous behaviour of lesser Greenskins, they only care about food, fighting and gear. Orc Warbosses that have regiments of Black Orcs soon learn to give them their own barracks where they can store their vast array of choppas and hang about with their own kind, because if they don't they quickly find their mobs of greener boyz dying!	false
building_flavour_texts_flavour_wh_main_grn_monsters_1	Trolls are attracted to Greenskin settlements in the same way stray dogs find themselves in human villages; the lure of a steady supply of food is a strong pull. Once they have found their way, Trolls will either find or be shepherded to a likely cave where they will "reside" until needed on the battlefield. However, summoning Trolls to battle means sending in a gobbo to fetch them, and they rarely come back outâ€¦	false
building_flavour_texts_flavour_wh_main_grn_monsters_2	To corral Giants is an all but impossible task. There have been a few examples of giant penz in the past but these inevitably go awry when a drunk Giant falls on a fence and the rest blunder out into the wilderness. The stompinâ€™ groundz, however, are where the Giants roam, and from where they can easily be lured into a Greenskin horde with the promise of booze...	false
building_flavour_texts_flavour_wh_main_grn_port_1	While Dwarfs carve quays out of solid rock, the Orcs and Norse have little more than wooden planks that jut into the sea. Empire wharfs - including those in Sylvania - are generally much sturdier. Since much of their trade comes down the large rivers they need reliable platforms of timber and stone to enable their ships to dock.	false
building_flavour_texts_flavour_wh_main_grn_port_2	There are many harbours in the Old World, as the nations oft use the large flowing rivers to transport goods from one place to another. Even the Empire's great inland cities have some kind of harbour for massive river barges to dock. The most famous of all harbours, perhaps, is in Barak Varr, the sea-gate of the Karaz Ankor. 	false
building_flavour_texts_flavour_wh_main_grn_port_3	Erengrad, Marienburg, Altdorf, Barak Varr, even the Orc pirate forts that riddle the coast by the Dragonback mountains are all built around or contain a series of ports. These are normally places that attract wealth, as they are great trading stations in those rare moments when there is a lull in the eternal war and also home to the fleet when it returns.	false
building_flavour_texts_flavour_wh_main_grn_resource_gold_1	Orcs mainly use teef as a currency, so donâ€™t have the thirst for gold that their stuntie and humie foes do. However, they do appreciate shiny stuff, especially as they can often exchange it for bigga and betta choppas, and â€˜arder armour. Shiny rocks found in caves can be hacked out by Snotlings and misbehavinâ€™ gobbos to supply the Bosses. 	false
building_flavour_texts_flavour_wh_main_grn_resource_gold_2	Larger holes in the ground, especially ones originally dug by stunties will have gold rocks and sparkly bits at the bottom. The problem is getting to it. The beardy gits use lifts and â€˜cleva gubbinzâ€™ to extract da loot, while Greenskins have more brutal methodsâ€¦	false
building_flavour_texts_flavour_wh_main_grn_resource_gold_3	For as long as the Greenskins have been invading the Dwarfen Karaz Ankor they have taken the mining outposts and most prosperous shafts from the Dawi. Orcs arenâ€™t even that attracted to gold. Sure, they like the look of the shiny stuff and attribute some value in teef to it, but itâ€™s mainly because they know that it really winds up da stunties when they do it.  	false
building_flavour_texts_flavour_wh_main_grn_resource_iron_military	Black Orcs are very particular when it comes to their weapons. They are normally "armed to da teef" but their choppas are the best, plundered from stunties or 'umies. They don't like the crud other Orcs and especially Goblins insist on using in a fight, preferring to use their own forge where they bash stolen metal into the biggest choppas possible!	false
building_flavour_texts_flavour_wh_main_grn_resource_pasture_furs_military	In the dankest parts of the forests or the Badlands lurk beasts that hunt gobbos. These creatures are mostly hunted, in turn, by the Orcs who â€“ if they can't fight each other "or da other zoggin' gits" â€“ be they stuntie or humie â€“ will scrap with the native fauna for food, for "teef" and for furs and hides. 	false
building_flavour_texts_flavour_wh_main_grn_resource_timber_military	Goblin sawmillz are 'automated' in the sense that Snotlings are trapped on a primitive conveyer belt and shown a particularly juicy mushroom, just out of reach, which gets them running like tiny green nutters, powering the conveyer which in turn spins the saw that cuts the wood... and any gobbo unlucky enough to be pushed into the blade's way.	false
building_flavour_texts_flavour_wh_main_grn_settlement_major_1	The greatest enemy of the Greenskins has always been their own kind. Out in the Badlands, the tribes prey upon each other in endless competition for dominance. Smaller tribes locate natural hideouts or lone encampments, allowing them time to establish themselves until they can go on the hunt themselves. 	false
building_flavour_texts_flavour_wh_main_grn_settlement_major_2	Greenskin camps are often temporary, consisting of crudely-fashioned tents and the inevitable dung piles. However, these camps can become almost permanent, as the Boss gets lazy and "canâ€™t be bovvered" to move on. In camp, the Greenskins dig fighting pits, erect totems and generally forget their previous wandering instincts.    	false
building_flavour_texts_flavour_wh_main_grn_settlement_major_3	Encampments are formed when one or more camps merge with each other. Tents become dung-covered huts, kennulz, Squig penz, boar sties and even grog-drenched drinking holes as more and more Greenskins are drawn to a settlement. Staked defences or roughly hewn moats will often surround the encampment to fend off foes who want to take the goodies within for themselves.	false
building_flavour_texts_flavour_wh_main_grn_settlement_major_4	Greenskin forts are mostly made from the ruins of Dwarf keeps, their founders long-since vanquished. The Orcs know this really winds up the stunties, so they revel in it. â€˜Improvementsâ€™ to the Dwarfen structures are always made in the form extra platforms, spiky bitz and carved faces of the Orc Gods. Not all forts use Dwarf foundations, there are some notable ramshackle structures in the Badlands with walls made entirely of bones and wood, but these are in the minority for obvious reasons of build quality.  	false
building_flavour_texts_flavour_wh_main_grn_settlement_major_5	The Greenskins have thrived these past millennia arguably because they have been able to take the Dwarfholds from the stunties, as the bearded gits retreated in the aftermath of their disastrous decline. Orcs have ever been opportunists, taking the Dwarfholds and the riches in their deep vaults without pause. Since they were established as the new landlords, the Greenskins have been almost impossible to shift, allowing their dominance of the surrounding regions to grow.	false
building_flavour_texts_flavour_wh_main_grn_shaman_1	When they are not dancing and prancing, Shamans can be quite glum and will reside in isolated, decrepit huts away from the tribe. Most Greenskins donâ€™t want a Shaman as their neighbour, because the chances of a giant green foot trampling them while they sleep is greatly increased. 	false
building_flavour_texts_flavour_wh_main_grn_shaman_2	In their hovels, Night Goblin Shamans concoct nefarious potions and poisonous mushroom brews to turn fanatics mad. They also self-administer, so may enter a trance state and commune with the Great Green Godz themselves.  	false
building_flavour_texts_flavour_wh_main_grn_walls_1	Under the eyes of an Orc Bully, Goblins will dig a trench around the settlement. If the Greenskins are canny enough, this will be the same ditch as "da drops". Woe betide any slackers though, as they will quickly feel the Bullyâ€™s lash. Of course, itâ€™s not so much the ditch that should worry attackers as what lives at the bottom of it! 	false
building_flavour_texts_flavour_wh_main_grn_walls_2	While itâ€™s not a full-on wall, the Greenskins' use of stakes can be effective. They are large, extremely pointy, and riddled with spiky bitz. To lay siege to one is an intimidating thing, especially when there are Goblins manning the defences, ready to maim any intruders with their stabbas. 	false
building_flavour_texts_flavour_wh_main_grn_walls_3	Big walls keep the enemy out, whether they be made from the ruins of Dwarfen works or erected by indentured Goblins. Thatâ€™s logic that even an Orc can follow, and one of the reasons why Greenskins crave Dwarfholds so much. Even away from the mountains, Orcs love a big wall. These are usually made from wood, banded with iron, with plenty of effigies of the gods dangling from them.	false
building_flavour_texts_flavour_wh_main_grn_workshop_1	While most gobbos - wisely - donâ€™t like to let on to their larger cousins that they are in fact a great deal brighter than their Orc overseers, there are a few that like to tinker with stuff. These Goblin "engineers" rarely receive the same respect their peers get and eke out a living on commandeered benches, out of the way of passing Orcs who canâ€™t resist punching the "speccy gits". 	false
building_flavour_texts_flavour_wh_main_grn_workshop_2	If a Goblin can prove to his Boss that his war machines work, the Orc may realise it is wise to keep him around - although a few hard cuffs around the â€˜ead should be administered so he knows who he still works for. With an understanding reached, the Goblin may be given a work space and even a few "assistants" to get on with the next project. This inevitably means trying to figure out how to get Goblins to fly, as there never seems to be a shortage of gobbos who wish to do so.	false
building_flavour_texts_flavour_wh_main_horde_chaos_dragon_ogres_1	When the pact was signed, whereby the Dragon Ogres sold their ignoble souls into damnation in exchange for near-immortality, several of their meeting grounds were said to be frozen in time. Marked with a boundary of skulls, these sites are immune to the warping effects of Chaos. Should a Daemon, or any servant of the Chaos Gods bearing their patron's mark, ever step over the skull boundary, then the pact between them will be ended.	false
building_flavour_texts_flavour_wh_main_horde_chaos_dragon_ogres_2	Fiercely independent, a Shaggoth will not swear fealty to a Daemonic master or even a mortal champion, for it is in thrall to the Gods themselves. Should a champion wish for the might of a Shaggoth in his army, then he must climb the peaks to the lightning grounds, petitioning the ancient beast as it stands proud and shrouded in bolts of lightning.  	false
building_flavour_texts_flavour_wh_main_horde_chaos_forge_1	Deep under the gorges that run across the wastes like fresh scars can be found pits that gutter and spew infernal fires. In the caverns before the fires radiates a heat that would make even make a Pyromancer recoil, but it is here that the hellsmiths hammer corrupted metal into shapes and contrivances decreed by the Ruinous Powers.  	false
building_flavour_texts_flavour_wh_main_horde_chaos_forge_2	The Daemonic forge exists within the hell fires, for heat and flame can no more singe a Daemon's flesh than blessed water can scald the skin of a Warrior Priest. Within the inferno, the hellsmiths hammer out armour for the servants of Chaos, so they may molest the southern lands. 	false
building_flavour_texts_flavour_wh_main_horde_chaos_giants_1	Giant migrations are far rarer now than in the past, for the Storm Giants are said to be no more. Yet there are remnants of the great Giant migrations - enclaves in the Badlands, deep in the forests of the Old World, and in the far north also. Those Giants that lingered in the shadow of the Realm of Chaos paid a high price for their indolence, becoming creatures of - and enslaved by - Chaos. 	false
building_flavour_texts_flavour_wh_main_horde_chaos_knights_1	Some roving bands of Chaos Knights will insist that their victims' skulls, bones and trinkets are collected in the aftermath of a battle. They are piled onto a palanquin by familiars and minions as testament to the Chaos Knights' abilities. Should a patron God look down and see this tribute, then he may be pleased and bless his servants with the gifts of Chaos. 	false
building_flavour_texts_flavour_wh_main_horde_chaos_knights_2	Pillars of skulls are not uncommon in the wastes close to the Realm of Chaos. They are said to be the bounty of the Chaos Knights, their many victims impaled on blackened lances, their souls sent to the Chaos Gods in payment for Chaos Armour and fell steeds.  	false
building_flavour_texts_flavour_wh_main_horde_chaos_magic_1	Often taking the form of a cracked ring partially buried in the ground and covered with dark runes, an arcane vortex is surely a mystery to mortals, even those not blissfully ignorant of the Dark Powers that reside in the north. What spill forth from the vortex are nightmare things and the occasional Chaos Sorcerer, sent as an emissary of the Chaos Gods. 	false
building_flavour_texts_flavour_wh_main_horde_chaos_magic_2	If the summoning or the glorifying act is strong enough, if the emotions of the summoner run hot and desperate, then a tear in the material realm can be made - a direct portal into the Realm of Chaos. For a mortal to stare into such a portal is to invite utter insanity, but what comes through it is the true threat. 	false
building_flavour_texts_flavour_wh_main_horde_chaos_marauders_1	A tribal relic can be the skeleton of a beloved or fierce Chieftain or maybe a an item of power; a relic imbued with the puissance of the crow, the serpent or whatever guise the Chaos Gods decide to use to appear before their willing worshippers. No matter the form, when it glows it calls to them and so the tribes come, for they know their master has need of them. 	false
building_flavour_texts_flavour_wh_main_horde_chaos_marauders_2	To live amongst the Marauder tribes is a brutal life that no southerner could contemplate. Members must constantly prove themselves martially or be cast out or slain as weak. The trial pits, hastily dug and sharpened-staked arenas, are where many tests are carried out. They fight against each other and Warhounds are thrown in too. Whatever comes out is deemed worthy, for now at any rate. 	false
building_flavour_texts_flavour_wh_main_horde_chaos_marauders_3	Among the Marauders, life is a brutal series of tests and challenges to achieve tribal rank and the favour of the Ruinous Powers. Although built for the same overall purpose, proving grounds are much larger than trial pits, with the capacity for competing warbands to face off against each other or even for entire tribes to clash in full sight of the Chaos Gods. Usually positioned high up on plateaus, in the hope that the fickle Gods will notice the savage acts committed there, the grounds are strewn with the bones and remains of the vanquished, left to rot where they fall, marking them out as places of death and disgusting, Ruinous reward.	false
building_flavour_texts_flavour_wh_main_horde_chaos_settlement_1	The Warriors of Chaos have no need of food and sleep, for they are imbued with power from the Chaos Gods and sustenance is a mortal concern. The iron-bound men make camp together to form bonds, warbands and worship their fell, Ruinous masters. 	false
building_flavour_texts_flavour_wh_main_horde_chaos_settlement_2	Although not tribes in the same sense as the Northmen, Chaos Warriors band together according to affiliations in their previous lives and, of course, their patron deities. Even those Warriors that worship Chaos undivided still have their own tribal connections, so band together to await the rise of Great Champion - a king with three eyes.  	false
building_flavour_texts_flavour_wh_main_horde_chaos_settlement_3	There are countless warbands in the far north, creating alliances swiftly only to break with each other in bloody fury just as quickly - much to the joy of Khorne. Others stick rigidly to their tenets; warbands such as the Sons of Necoho have no interest in the south and only ever fight other Chaos warbands. 	false
building_flavour_texts_flavour_wh_main_horde_chaos_settlement_4	The legions of Chaos yearn for souls with which to feed their Dark Gods. When a champion stands forth, worthy and powerful enough to command the might of its legions, they will cease infighting and prepare to march south. For that is where the harvest is: the souls required to slake the Chaos Gods' thirst.  	false
building_flavour_texts_flavour_wh_main_horde_chaos_settlement_5	It takes no less than a crowned Everchosen of all four Dark Powers to be able to command and control the unwieldy Ruinous Warhost. It is a cabal of countless thousands, a fragile alliance that could shatter at any moment should the Everchosen's underlings detect weakness... or opportunity. However, those rare few champions with the force of will and pure malice to keep the warhost together will lead a mighty horde of iron and corruption into the mortal lands, where utter destruction awaits. 	false
building_flavour_texts_flavour_wh_main_horde_chaos_trolls_1	There is a reason the area north of Kislev is known as Troll Country, for this is where monsters lurk and hunt, especially Trolls. The further north you go, Trolls become less prevalent but still not entirely uncommon. These ones have been warped by the corrupting influence of Chaos - they have been mutated and driven insane with the need to kill. 	false
building_flavour_texts_flavour_wh_main_horde_chaos_warriors_1	Summoning the many minions of Chaos is a power even the lowliest servant has. Whether a Greater Daemon, a familiar, or the iron-clad warbands of the Chaos Warriors, there is always some method or ritual. For Chaos Warriors who are not led or sent by dark wings, one way is to plant a blasphemous icon in cursed ground. A sonorous call will spread, drawing Chaos Warriors and fell beasts to its source.	false
building_flavour_texts_flavour_wh_main_horde_chaos_warriors_2	The altars of the Dark Gods of fell things are enough to make normal mortals with mundane souls recoil, their eyes shrivelled in horror.

building_flavour_texts_flavour_wh_main_horde_chaos_warriors_3	Prayers and sacrifices offered from Warshrines are like sweet nectar to the otherworldly beings that reside within the Realm of Chaos. The very air crackles with power around each shrine when the eyes of the Gods turn their way. The presence of altars empowers and emboldens the Chaos Warriors fighting before them, drawing only the very best into their radiance. 	false
building_flavour_texts_flavour_wh_main_horde_chaos_weapons_1	In the tribal warbands of Chaos Warriors, customs and traditions are few and far between. Yet one practice does seem appear to take place: to take a weapon from the mound of blades a Chaos Warrior must first place another upon it. The offered weapon cannot be his own, it must be taken from the corpse of a sworn foe. The rare few who forswear this custom discover at their cost that this is one tradition that the Chaos Gods seem to appreciate. 	false
building_flavour_texts_flavour_wh_main_horde_chaos_weapons_2	Reliquaries are unholy stores of a Warband's most treasured weapons. It is true that champions keep their most prized accoutrements on their person at all times, but for those lucky enough to acquire a fine blade or ensorcelled axe, a reliquary will keep it safe from rivals. 	false
building_flavour_texts_flavour_wh_main_horde_savage_farm_1	When not fightinâ€™, Orcs are eatinâ€™ or drinkinâ€™ - probably both. Hunting fieldz are areas not far from the camp that contain plenty of "game" for when Wolf Riders or Orc Huntinâ€™ Parties want to get some grub. What qualifies as game is an interesting point - birds and four-legged creatures count, but so do stragglers, lone travellers and even members from the same hunting group, should they get separated! 	false
building_flavour_texts_flavour_wh_main_horde_savage_farm_2	The cookinâ€™ groundz are places, dominated by large bonfires, that burn throughout the day sending acrid smoke all about, along with the harsh smell of burnt offal. Spits and stew pots crisscross the fires, containing all manner of joints - from whole boars to the odd Goblin leg slowly rotating in the flames and fungus stews rapidly boiling on the coals.   	false
building_flavour_texts_flavour_wh_main_horde_savage_farm_3	Squig Penz keep these fungal-animal hybrids caged in one place for the safety of the camp. The Squigs' natural habitats are deep, dank caverns and pitch-black caves. It's up to the Squig Herders to hunt these spheroid creatures, which is no easy task as they are fast, powerful and perfectly designed for tunnel fighting; the Squig is able to back into a hole and present nothing but great slashing teeth to its attacker! 	false
building_flavour_texts_flavour_wh_main_horde_savage_industry_1	Lumbur camps is probably an overly-complex name for what is essentially a big pile of wood. While more competent races seek sturdy trees for their lumber, Orcs given this most un-Orcy of duties will pick up any rotting tree stumps or sticks they can find - let the gits at the saw mill worry about it later!	false
building_flavour_texts_flavour_wh_main_horde_savage_industry_2	A giant spinning saw created by Goblins is both the most horrifying thing to witness and a stroke of Greenskin brilliance. Powered by goaded War Boars on a treadmill, the saw spins at a rapid speed and can churn through wood, bone, armour and any careless Gobbo that gets within pushing distance of the conveyer belt. 	false
building_flavour_texts_flavour_wh_main_horde_savage_industry_3	Greenskins can be surprisingly industrious and use wood in all manner of ways - not just for hittinâ€™ stuff. Many of their war machines and buildings use wood when combined with mud and other clay-like materials. Of course, not all wood comes from the saw millz, a large portion of it is purloined from human settlements when the Greenskins go raidinâ€™.   	false
building_flavour_texts_flavour_wh_main_human_port_ruin	There are many ruins within the Old World and beyond. Even in the Empire - the heart of civilisation - there are strange, ruined cities, their original inhabitants lost to time. In the Badlands lies Morgheim, once known as Mourkain, the capital of the Strygos Empire and now an infamous ruin. Of course, even further south, are the sand-scoured Tomb Cities of Khemri... 	false
building_flavour_texts_flavour_wh_main_kislev_worship_1	Ursun and his followers shun the trappings of other religious organisations. However, in the Kislevite Tundra there are sacred places â€“ standing stones in the Bear-Father's honour, with at least one stone carved in his likeness. The caves of black bears are also considered sacred, for the Gospodars always considered such animals to be godly creatures â€“ capturing the strength and power that every Kislev warrior craves. 	false
building_flavour_texts_flavour_wh_main_kislev_worship_2	The so-called temples of Ursun are more like urban forests â€“ groves of tall trees surrounded by the streets of Erengrad and Kislev city. These are the two known groves of Ursun, but rumours persist that there are others whose locations are known only to those with Gospodar blood. In any case, the priests of Ursun only welcome worshippers in the spring and summer months, the groves otherwise being closed for the "long hibernation". 	false
building_flavour_texts_flavour_wh_main_ksl_port_1	While Dwarfs carve quays out of solid rock, the Orcs and Norse have little more than a wooden planks that jut into the sea. Empire wharfs - including those in Sylvania - are generally much sturdier as much of their trade comes down the large rivers so they need reliable platforms of timber and stone for their ships to dock at. 	false
building_flavour_texts_flavour_wh_main_ksl_port_2	There are many harbours in the Old World as the nations have used the large flowing rivers to transport goods from one place to another. Even the Empire's great inland cities will have some kind of harbour for the massive river barges to dock. The most famous of all harbours, perhaps, is in Barak Varr, the sea-gate of the Karaz Ankor. 	false
building_flavour_texts_flavour_wh_main_ksl_port_3	Erengrad, Marienburg, Altdorf, Barak Varr, even the Orc pirate forts that riddle the coast by the Dragonback mountains, are all built around or contain a series of ports. These are normally places where wealth is drawn to, as they are great trading stations in those rare moments when war lulls and also home to the naval fleets when it returns.	false
building_flavour_texts_flavour_wh_main_middenheim_worship_1	Ulric was Sigmar's God when the first Emperor still lived. This makes Ulric's cult a powerful force within the Empire, second only in prominence to the Cult of Sigmar itself. There are shrines to the Wolf Father across the whole Empire, although it is the northern provinces, those further away from Reikland, that see the greater propensity. 	false
building_flavour_texts_flavour_wh_main_middenheim_worship_2	While the greatest temple lies at the top of the Ulricsberg, within Middenheim, there are many temples dedicated to the God of Wolves and Winter. These are mainly in northern Empire towns - Nordberg, Wolfenburg and Salzenmund, for example, although Nuln, a traditionally Sigmarite city, has a surprisingly large congregation.	false
building_flavour_texts_flavour_wh_main_nor_beasts_1	In Norsca, wolves and hounds prowl in the flickering shadows of the campfires made by the barbarian tribespeople of the frozen lands. The further north the tribe dwells, the more likely it is that the hounds that follow them will be mutants, their bodies swollen by the energies of Chaos. Brutish and bloodthirsty, Warhounds are natural killers built of muscle and fang that prowl the wilderness in ravening packs. They will even charge a spearwall with total abandon, their only concern being the moment when their slobbering jaws sink into juicy, yielding flesh.	false
building_flavour_texts_flavour_wh_main_nor_beasts_2	As with all creatures of the Old World, the further north one goes, the more likely an encounter with a beast touched by the mutations of the Ruinous Powers. Ice Wolves and Skin Wolves are two such afflicted beasts â€“ like their Warhound cousins, their wolf mutations are the result of exposure to the energies of Chaos deep in the malign wilderness of Troll Country where they originate. These ravenous beasts are useful in battle, but even those brought under the chieftainsâ€™ war banners are still not considered â€˜tamedâ€™ and will indiscriminately devour many unknowing individuals who carelessly stray near to their dens around feeding times!	false
building_flavour_texts_flavour_wh_main_nor_beasts_3	The Northmen believe that even those cast down with mutation have been chosen, and it is better to be chosen than to live your whole life beyond the sight of the Gods. Some ferally-mutated champions known as 'werekin' live in caves deep within the frozen wastes. When they are not being brought to war by the raiding tribes, the werekin feed on offerings and sacrifices from the locals, or otherwise devour unknowing passers-by who happen to carelessly dwell too close to their dens.	false
building_flavour_texts_flavour_wh_main_nor_chaos_1	Although the Northmen live for battle, they are an extremely superstitious people whose ambitions are to ultimately face the judgement of their Gods. The primary place of commune with their deities is on the battlefield, where they offer up the deaths of those they slay. But there are also places back at camp where the Ruinous Ones are depicted in various ways depending on local tribal beliefs. These locations are not used for worship or prayer, however, but are mostly places littered with the lesser offerings of entrails and organs, both human and animal, around the various effigies.	false
building_flavour_texts_flavour_wh_main_nor_chaos_2	It is not easy to bring large creatures such as Giants or Mammoths under control to use as beasts of war. Such large brutish creatures are often extremely strong-willed and stubborn. Giants at least can be bribed with things like man-flesh and alcohol, whereas War Mammoths cannot be reasoned with in the same way. Therefore, in many strongholds an altar might be built for use by the Shaman-Sorcerers, upon which they conduct mysterious rituals to gain control over the colossuses of the troop.	false
building_flavour_texts_flavour_wh_main_nor_creatures_1	Ice Trolls originate further north than their counterparts from Troll Country. All Trolls have indiscriminate appetites and unthinking ferocity, and the northern variety are no different. With their great strength and regenerative abilities, the warlike Northmen find uses for Trolls in battle, despite their rather limited intelligence. Most varieties are able to spew acidic stomach bile over their victims to inflict a nasty death, but the Ice Trollsâ€™ proximity to the Chaos Wastes has caused this ability to mutate into something else altogether. With a single exhalation of their icy breath, they can instantly freeze their foes in their tracks, usually just before gobbling them up in a crunch of icy flesh and bones.	false
building_flavour_texts_flavour_wh_main_nor_creatures_2	Where the land suits them, the amphibious Fimir haunt the desolate moorlands of Norsca, especially where it is boggy and marshy enough for them to feel comfortable. Deep in the fens, they build their primitive shelters in craggy piles of rock which are seldom seen by outsiders. Most of the time Fimir hovels are wreathed in thick mist magically generated by their Balefiends to hide them from prying eyes, but mostly to shield them from the harsh glare of the sun. Norsca is the ideal habitat for the Fimir due to the exceptionally long and dark winters, which mean they arenâ€™t subjected to much sunlight anyway.	false
building_flavour_texts_flavour_wh_main_nor_creatures_3	Subterranean passageways in the north potentially give the local tribes access to the fellest of creatures. The snowy and mountainous nature of the ancient landscape means that thousands of glaciers exist there, providing numerous areas for icy tunnels to form naturally. The networks of glacial tunnels in the ice can be labyrinthine, providing the ideal habitat for monstrous Chaos Frost Dragons, who spend much of their time in quiet hibernation. It is for the benefit of most that they slumber in hard-to-reach burrows â€“ when awake and on the surface, they are likely to be killing and feeding.	false
building_flavour_texts_flavour_wh_main_nor_erengrad_unique	When Throgg, the Troll King travelled north to Winter Pyre in search of warriors to serve him in his despoilment of the world, the Kislevites discovered his throne within Troll Country. Once he has wrested back control of the region, he will be able to enter his icy halls once again. Then the world will feel the full wrath of the Lord of the Monstrous Horde, as his army destroys all in its path!	false
building_flavour_texts_flavour_wh_main_nor_garrison_1	Whether camp or village, the Marauders have learnt over many generations that they need to stand watch over what meagre possessions they have or they will be taken away. As devout as they are, their Ruinous masters are capricious and would think nothing of their deaths. 	false
building_flavour_texts_flavour_wh_main_nor_garrison_2	Marauder tribes have no real concept of defence, therefore defensive structures are alien to them - after all, hiding behind walls is what the southlanders do to avoid them! The Norse spend their time raiding other civilisations and have little interest or skill in wall-building. However, the more established a settlement becomes, the more its Chieftain will want to protect all he has accrued, so basic Watch Towers are built to warn the tribes of enemy incursion. 	false
building_flavour_texts_flavour_wh_main_nor_garrison_3	No Northman likes to be left behind during a raid, but sometimes it is necessary to protect the warbandâ€™s possessions. Since raids are often carried out in batches, as soon as some loot is acquired someone needs to watch it when subsequent forays are underway. Needless to say, the men chosen do the task do it begrudgingly â€“ after all, Norscans live to raid, not to guard assets. More often than not, the members of the militia are being punished for some minor transgression or another against the tribe, or maybe the Chieftain just doesnâ€™t like them!	false
building_flavour_texts_flavour_wh_main_nor_loot	Norsca may be known as a land of extreme scarcity, but when raiding the Northmen more than compensate themselves for the hardships suffered at home. When they march or sail out to sack nearby settlements, they do not only carry off the usual necessities such as livestock, grains, and slaves, but also gold coin, trinkets, jewels, and other treasures. Although monetary wealth does not have as much value in Norscan society as it does in the rest of the Old World, it can still enable the purchase of things from outside of Norsca that canâ€™t be obtained by force.	false
building_flavour_texts_flavour_wh_main_nor_military_1	Amidst the ice, away from the encampment, a crude fighting ring will be established where members of the tribe can test their mettle against each other. Though primarily a way to hone their fighting skills, bloodshed is never far from a Norseman's mind and many such fights have quickly turned from practice to lethal bouts. 	false
building_flavour_texts_flavour_wh_main_nor_military_2	If a tribe grows large enough in power and populace then the Marauder Chieftain's personal retinue of raiders, who accompany him on his longship and in battle, will be set apart from the rest of the tribe. Their status guarantees them the best of the plunder and their own camp area, often near the prized Warhound kennels. These warriors are said to be closest to the Chaos Gods and the most likely to receive their gifts. 	false
building_flavour_texts_flavour_wh_main_nor_military_3	Only permanent Norse settlements have a meeting hall. When camped, the Chieftain has the biggest tent, so in villages he uses the largest building as his base. Halls are usually made from upturned longship hulls, specially-built great round huts or built into caves, always at the foot of some unholy monument used to summon monsters to their cause.   	false
building_flavour_texts_flavour_wh_main_nor_monoliths	The Dark Gods are known to the Norscans as the Hound, the Eagle, the Crow, and the Serpent â€“ the embodiment of the four brothers in darkness who rule the Realm of Chaos. It is the goal of all Northmen to gain the attention of one of these Ruinous Masters, worshipping a single deity above all others. The erection of monuments where the Northmen have successfully pillaged is one of the ways they strengthen their affiliation with their chosen God, willing their deeds to be deemed worthy of favour by way of these fell monoliths.	false
building_flavour_texts_flavour_wh_main_nor_offerings	Offering up sacrifices, whether man or beast, is by and large the most common Norscan ritual prior to battle. The sacrificial rites performed by the tribesmen differ from those performed by the Shaman-Sorcerers, who commune with all manner of petty Godlings and Daemons for their nefarious schemes, whereas warriors will only seek to spill blood sacrificially as a way to connect with their chosen masters. By first drawing their Gods' attentions before the battle, they feel they will have a better chance of being spotted once the real killing starts.	false
building_flavour_texts_flavour_wh_main_nor_outpost_experience	The Northmen are extremely superstitious people. Many tribesmen have their skin tattooed with symbols of malign power, or simply the mark of their clan. Others brand themselves with runes of abjuration to further court the favour of their Dark Masters. Perhaps the grisliest of the Northmenâ€™s customs is the self-mutilation of flesh before battle, daubing patterns upon themselves and searing images into their skin with hot irons, believing that the signs of devotion will protect them from deathâ€™s cold claw. Whether these protective measures work or not is immaterial, for Norscans believe in them as surely as the sun rises.	false
building_flavour_texts_flavour_wh_main_nor_outpost_income_1	There are several strange rites of passage amongst the Northmen, which can vary from tribe to tribe. The frenzied nature of Norscan raids mean that losses are inevitable, whether a raid is successful or not. One particular tribal practice is to bring the remains of the fallen brethren to the centre of the camp and lay them down in a circular arrangement for all to see. For the Northmen, this is seen to honour those who have fought without fear, especially if they died gruesomely in battle and now only exist as bloated, dismembered corpses.	false
building_flavour_texts_flavour_wh_main_nor_outpost_income_2	The most common method used by the Northmen to commune with their Gods comes in battle â€“ either by killing, or being killed. However, sometimes the Marauders seek to prove themselves to their Gods away from the battlefield by duelling each other rather than the enemy, particularly when there is a lull in raiding. Such fights to the death do not always occur for sanctimonious reasons and can sometimes just be a way to settle disputes. Although in reality, if the Marauders disagree with one another, a blood-soaked resolution is arrived at far before the dispute is 'formally' brought to the blood-grove. It matters not â€“ wherever blood is spilt by the Northmen, the Dark Gods will watch with glee.	false
building_flavour_texts_flavour_wh_main_nor_outpost_income_3	There are very few instances when the Northmen will show respect to their battlefield opponents. To the Norscan warrior, a man gains honour and respect simply by fighting without fear, even in the face of futility, and some tribal customs even extend this esteem to enemies. One such custom is the storage and display of the bodies of the greatest kings and the bravest warriors of other races that have fallen before the Northmen. Corpses are kept untouched from the moment they were slain in battle and sat in the plunder halls still adorning their priceless armour. They are placed amongst the countless other treasures and other venerable victims, now existing as either skeletons or still-rotting corpses in full battlefield attire.	false
building_flavour_texts_flavour_wh_main_nor_outpost_settlement_1	It is not often that Norscans choose to take over another raceâ€™s dwellings rather than raze them to the ground, but when they do, a civilised place can quickly become a hovel of debauchery. The Northmen love to revel in their victories, chanting the names of their Gods as they drink themselves comatose. However, such depravity only lasts as long until they get restless for another raid, which usually isnâ€™t long!	false
building_flavour_texts_flavour_wh_main_nor_outpost_settlement_2	Even when the Northmen are away from their homeland, their tribal affiliations still hold strong. In many cases, they are bound together by their affiliation to one of the Dark Gods. These loyalties are considered important - they minimise the possibility of desertion, for there is always the chance that the bountiful fruits of the southern lands will entice individuals to splinter away and form their own raiding parties.	false
building_flavour_texts_flavour_wh_main_nor_outpost_settlement_3	When an outpost gets big enough, the Northmen will endeavour to make the land more defensible, as well as making it a place from which massive raids can be launched quickly. The most common Norscan technique is to create an artificial fjord that can make a settlement near-impossible to penetrate from the sea, while other techniques are employed to guard against land-based attacks, such as the construction of guard shacks and watchtowers.	false
building_flavour_texts_flavour_wh_main_nor_port	While Dwarfs carve quays out of solid rock, the Orcs and Norse have little more than wooden planks that jut into the sea. Empire wharfs - including those in Sylvania - are generally much sturdier. Since much of their trade comes down the large rivers they need reliable platforms of timber and stone to enable their ships to dock.	false
building_flavour_texts_flavour_wh_main_nor_port_2	The Norscan use of longships shaped the histories of the Old Worldâ€™s coasts. Without them, the Northmen would still likely be the notoriously fierce fighters they are known to be, but would certainly not have been able to reach as far as they did. The clinker-built sail-and-oar style of construction that dominates most Norscan longship designs make them exceptionally sturdy, so that they can handle the seas at home and further afield. If a vessel can navigate the rough, unpredictable seas around Norscaâ€™s coast, it can handle the worst that any oceans of the Old World can throw at it!	false
building_flavour_texts_flavour_wh_main_nor_port_3	The more success the warriors of a settlement experience in their raiding forays, the more warriors that will inevitably flock to join the warband. Whenever restless tribesmen hear of successful killing and plunder by other tribes, migration can turn a humble wharf into a bustling raiding port. Such high numbers of longships entering and exiting a harbour still require a certain level of organisation, even by savages â€“ otherwise there would be a great number of shipwrecks around Norscan ports!	false
building_flavour_texts_flavour_wh_main_nor_settlement_major_4	The northern tribes recognise no border other than the horizon ahead of them, but sometimes a group will grow big enough to hold sway over a large area. To unify such unruly men into a single warband, a warlord or champion may assert control over the land, usually with an entrenched stronghold at its nucleus. In the barren, frozen soil of Norsca, however, the value of the land is not in its resources â€“ to the Northmen, geographical control is merely a symbol of dominance. If a rival tribeâ€™s members enter these demarcations for any other reason than to join the local warlordâ€™s ranks, they will almost certainly be attacked and killed.	false
building_flavour_texts_flavour_wh_main_nor_settlement_major_5	The Northmen and the other twisted creatures living in the shadow of Chaos exist for war. It is the will of their Ruinous Masters, who revel in the killing done in their names. This shapes the way Norscan societies form and grow. For example, the stronger tribes will swallow up the weaker ones resulting in larger, more dominant groups based around the largest strongholds in Norsca. The sites of all such strongholds containing the largest gatherings almost always have the same features â€“ they are defensible, usually nestled in mountains or hidden in dense forest, and are positioned to give the inhabitants the ability to see in all directions.	false
building_flavour_texts_flavour_wh_main_nor_settlement_minor_1	Northmen have little concept of nation or allegiance beyond their immediate tribe; they recognise no border beyond the horizon. They settle where they can, laying camp wherever the dark energies wax strongest, and following signs planted by their capricious Gods. Inland camps are rarer as Norse tribes tend to stay near the coasts for sustenance, especially if they have longships in tow. 	false
building_flavour_texts_flavour_wh_main_nor_settlement_minor_2	Assuming tribes don't kill each other on sight, an uneasy pact will form and a 'moot' begins. Moots can be two or even several tribes, gathered by chance or decree. A large fire pit is usually dug and the tribes set up camp on opposite sides. A monstrous beast will be hunted and set to roast on the open flames before the talking begins. Usually, this consists of boasts followed by lethal tests of strength and skill, with binding blood pacts made at the end.  	false
building_flavour_texts_flavour_wh_main_nor_settlement_minor_3	The combination of Norsca's inhospitable landscape and the dark nature of its denizens means there very few permanent settlements there. Those endure amidst ice and monsters remain due to wharfs or natural harbours allowing Marauders access to their longships. Such villages will probably have a very crude defensive stockade, a meeting hall, and a large communal fire pit, as well as some kind of altar or shrine to their dark masters.	false
building_flavour_texts_flavour_wh_main_nor_slaves_1_2	Although killing a creature that has been exposed to the mutating energies of Chaos is notoriously difficult, in many cases, skinning one is not. There are also many different advantages to doing so â€“ Norscan Trollskin, for example, is as sturdy as even the toughest leathers, but unlike normal pelts has a much greater elasticity. Mammoth fur can insulate a man against even the most bitter winter winds that would otherwise render him frostbitten within seconds. Of course, the only individuals lucky enough to experience these advantages are the toughened warriors who manage to slay such beasts, who will force their thralls to treat and prepare the pelts that have been acquired for use as brigandines or other such apparel.	false
building_flavour_texts_flavour_wh_main_nor_slaves_3	The most wretched existence for any Old Worlder is life as a Norscan slave. Each raid along the coasts of the Empire and Bretonnia results in more and more people captured and brought back for a fate some consider to be worse than death. In many cases, death is not far away for the slaves anyway â€“ sacrifice by disembowelment is common practice before any Norscan raid or battle. Still, some thralls have value and drive what little economy Norsca has. Any slaves observed to be adept at beast tanning or metalwork, for example, live the short remainder of their able-bodied lives doing hard labour.	false
building_flavour_texts_flavour_wh_main_nor_smith_1	A smithy is a crude workshop and forge, usually constructed by a smith from outside the tribe, a slave taken from the southlands and only kept alive due to his useful skills. In the most basic of surroundings, he is forced to beat and shape armour fragments and shoe the Marauders' vicious steeds. 	false
building_flavour_texts_flavour_wh_main_nor_smith_2	The addition of a brick kiln to a smithyâ€™s workshop can have major effects for the Norscan warband it belongs to. As the group grows, so too does its requirement for better and more plentiful weapons and armour. Providing a purpose-built kiln means higher temperatures can be achieved for metallurgy and roasting iron ores, enabling the manufacture of more advanced contraptions of war. This includes things like beast armour and components for chariots that make them faster and more able to inflict maximum damage.	false
building_flavour_texts_flavour_wh_main_nor_smith_3	The magical embers found in the perpetually-aflame pyres of the Chaos Wastes burn hotter and for much longer than any fuel in the realms of Norsca or anywhere further south. This makes them extremely useful for use in a smithyâ€™s workshop furnace, as a fire that burns hotter for longer can create much harder weapons and armour. Obtaining the embers is not easy, however, since transporting them can be complicated, and not to mention that very few individuals actually enter the Chaos Wastes and return to tell the tale.	false
building_flavour_texts_flavour_wh_main_nor_stables_1	Marauder Horsemen can be found across the steppes and wastelands north of Troll Country. Norsemen prefer their longships, but have had contact with the tribes in the west and so often accrue steeds. Norsca is even harsher for the horses than the northern steppes, yet having been born so close to the Realm of Chaos, the horses eschew grass in favour of watered-down blood and even flesh. They are usually kept in shielings - very basic bestial abodes close to camp.   	false
building_flavour_texts_flavour_wh_main_nor_stables_2	Corrals will be crude affairs, constructed from broken oars and weirwood, with a shieling attached to offer some shelter when the ice-chill winds blow strong. Horsemen are expert hunters. After taking their steeds from the corral, they travel inland far across the glaciers and steppes with axe in hand, looking for vermin and even larger prey to bring back to the village as tribute and food. 	false
building_flavour_texts_flavour_wh_main_nor_stables_3	When a group of tribesmen reaches a certain size, there comes a point when shielings and corrals are no longer sufficient to store all the warriorsâ€™ mounts. All good armies of men have divisions of cavalry, and although the Norscan warbands may be viewed by some as being savage and unorganised, they too have the need for mounted units in sufficient numbers to aid them in their raids. Although the war steeds are kept in stables, the Ice Wolves used in the Norscan battle ranks must also share those enclosures, which means they have to be designed and built with partitioning in mind.	false
building_flavour_texts_flavour_wh_main_nor_walls_1	The first and last line of defence for a Norscan enclave is always its ferocious warriors, but in many cases earthworks and parapets are used to improve the chances of deflecting attacks. Elevation of the soil means an uphill charge for assailants, and also obscures their view of whatever might be waiting for them over the ramparts â€“ which is typically a lot of men with a lot of axes!	false
building_flavour_texts_flavour_wh_main_nor_walls_2	Skulls serve many functions for the fighting tribes of the north. Many chieftains and champions collect them as trophies, either adorning their own armour with the fleshless heads of their victims, or otherwise putting them on display in their plunder halls and treasure troves. The imagery of a manâ€™s skull is also used decoratively by the Northmen to enhance the ferocious appearance of defensive fortifications. Itâ€™s not surprising that the tribes which enjoy the highest kill-counts in battle have the most skull-laden settlements of all.	false
building_flavour_texts_flavour_wh_main_nor_walls_3	One of many gory practices in Norscan settlements is the construction of walls and barriers out of the bodies of the dead. Some Chieftains will order that corpses be hauled back to the camps after battles and raids to be used for this very purpose, but more often it is a case that a Norscan settlement has deflected so many attacks successfully that there is a surplus of the dead available to use. Not only is it an incredibly demoralising sight for any potential assailants of the settlement, but because of the effect that the twisted energies of Chaos have on body decomposition, the mounds of the dead calcify over time to create extremely sturdy barricades.	false
building_flavour_texts_flavour_wh_main_nor_worship_1	The Dark Gods' omnipresence in the reaches of the north mean men who carve out an existence there are devout indeed. To the Northmen, the favour of their Gods is a vital and glorious part of their lives. A Northman communes with his deities directly, whether upon a Ruinous Altar or not. They dedicate their body and soul to the Gods, rather than offering petty prayers at the behest of sanctimonious priests.  	false
building_flavour_texts_flavour_wh_main_nor_worship_2	Norsca and much else in the north is scattered with fell monuments and shrines to the Dark Gods, places such as the Tower of Torment and the Folly of Malofex. More permanent Marauder settlements contain shrines most likely built atop a Ruinous Altar as tributes and sacrifices have grown. When, or if, a Sorcerer visits the village he will call a moot at the Chaos Shrine, for he is a messenger and spell-weaver of the Dark Powers.  	false
building_flavour_texts_flavour_wh_main_nor_worship_major	The Shaman-Sorcerers that embed themselves into warbands are often the ones creating the impetus for war. They act as conduits, pursuing dark pacts and bargains with numerous Chaos Godlings and Daemons while using their prophetic influence to suggestively whisper into the ears of the chieftains, guiding them towards mass slaughter. The most powerful of the Shaman-Sorcerers use pyres sometimes located in purpose-built temples in order to augment their influence. Upon these pyres, they burn the living flesh of war captives, slaves, animals, or even castigated tribesmen in order to conduct their dark rituals.	false
building_flavour_texts_flavour_wh_main_savage_boss_1	As befits their elevated status, Big Bosses get big tents. They usually get them by taking over the tent of the previous Big Boss. The reason why the previous Big Boss is not in the tent may be because he died in battle, but more likely heâ€™s dead in a ditch, probably near "da drops", with a rather large knife wound in his back. 	false
building_flavour_texts_flavour_wh_main_savage_boss_2	As Bosses grow in power, they gain more followers, add more to the tribeâ€™s pile of shiny stuff, and get more privileges - such as their own shack. By the standards of other races, this is still barely a building, but for the Greenskins, it is an impressive sight and one that marks the owner as "goinâ€™ places". 	false
building_flavour_texts_flavour_wh_main_savage_garrison_1	Watch Towers allow Greenskins to "keep an eye on fings" not happening in the immediate vicinity of the settlement. Goblins have keener eyesight and are better at heights so are more suited to the role, although they get bored easily, and frequently end up either flinging each other off or sitting around singing about Trolls in the Pantry and rarely actually doing any watchinâ€™!	false
building_flavour_texts_flavour_wh_main_savage_garrison_2	Orc Guard Houses range from shacks close to important locations in the camp, such as gates or chambers set aside to keep the Bossâ€™ pile of shiny stuff safe. Itâ€™s a dull job, when all you want to really do is bash the enemy; but some fool has to do it. On the plus side, you get to sit in the guard house picking bogies out of your nose.	false
building_flavour_texts_flavour_wh_main_savage_industry_1	When not on a tribal migration, a Savage Orc bone carver likes to pick a spot and stay there until whatever he is fashioning is completed. Not so much a trial if carving something simple, but more challenging if going for an intricately - well, intricate for an Orc - carved Shamanâ€™s staff.  	false
building_flavour_texts_flavour_wh_main_savage_industry_2	A bone crafter is not an official title, for the Savage Orcs donâ€™t do ranks very well, or indeed at all. Nevertheless, it is easy to spot his abode as it is always an area or tent surrounded by bony totems, blades and other fetishes that dangle, clash and chime when the breeze moves them.	false
building_flavour_texts_flavour_wh_main_savage_industry_3	With bone being such an important facet of Savage Orc society, the most talented bone carvers work in the Hut of Bones (imaginative, huh?). This "building" is, perhaps unsurprisingly, a simple shack covered in and surrounded by bones of various sizes from countless dismembered creatures.	false
building_flavour_texts_flavour_wh_main_savage_military_1	Musta fieldz are usually any area that the Boss likes to gather his boyz for a good shoutinâ€™. When the brawlinâ€™ is done, the lads might get round to some choppa practice or some stabbinâ€™ if the gobbos are havinâ€™ a go. Inevitably, "practice" will turn into something more brutal and deadly when one of the boyz "accidentally" connects with another. 	false
building_flavour_texts_flavour_wh_main_savage_military_2	Be it an empty underground hall that Stunties used to store their gold in or a large space marked by Idols on the plains, the brawlinâ€™ groundz are an important area only the most inconsiderate of Bosses would shun. This is where Orcs gather in large numbers for a fight and to improve their "swagga".  	false
building_flavour_texts_flavour_wh_main_savage_military_3	The fightinâ€™ pits are for Orcs to "'ave it out wiv each ovver". The strongest, toughest and most scarred Orcs (and the occasional Goblin drunk on mushroom brew) go into the pit for a serious fight against a ferocious opponent, with only one coming back out. On occasion the Boss himself has jumped into the pit after being challenged. The challenger usually only emerging as a disembodied head to be stuck on the Boss pole.   	false
building_flavour_texts_flavour_wh_main_savage_settlement_major_1	Savage Orcs are even more nomadic than their more sophisticated kin. However, there are crude migratory routes that all tribes follow, navigated by way-points such as strange standing stones, familiar hillocks or weather-beaten idols.	false
building_flavour_texts_flavour_wh_main_savage_settlement_major_2	Savage Orc camps happen when the bestial primitives decide to settle for a while. Their camps consist of large fires - around which Savage Orc Shamans ponce in skull hats and cloaks of matted fur - and a few shelters made from animal hides with bone supports. Orcs from rival tribes enter at their own risk, as they may soon find themselves in the cookinâ€™ pot!	false
building_flavour_texts_flavour_wh_main_savage_settlement_major_3	"Great Gatherinâ€™s" happen by chance and circumstance rather than any kind of organisation.

Gathering here as a large host, perhaps around a well-known landmark, before heading off into the fray.	false

building_flavour_texts_flavour_wh_main_special_blazing_sun_chapterhouse	Myrmidia is a goddess of war worshipped mainly in the southern nations, although a fair few Empire-men give her devotion as well. Most famously, the Knights of the Blazing Sun are her Templars, despite being based in the Taal-worshipping city of Talabheim.

However, cider from Bordeleaux is also considered some of the best in the world, much to chagrin of the cider makers in Wissenland! It is the orchards of the Morceaux Valley which provide the sweet red apples that makes the drink so good.	false
building_flavour_texts_flavour_wh_main_special_bordeleaux_vineyards_2	The vintners of the Morceaux Valley are the best winemakers in the Old World. Such is the beauty of their product that even the Elves of Ulthuan have begrudgingly accepted the quality of the vintages, the High Elven emissary to Bretonnia calling it merely "tolerable" - praise indeed from the tall folk.	false
building_flavour_texts_flavour_wh_main_special_bordeleaux_vineyards_3	In Bordeleaux its not gold that the nobles prize above all else but the grape, for that is what has made so many of the landed lords, and especially the ruling Duke Alberic, so rich. It's no wonder that the vintners only release so many cases each year and in doing so keep demand artificially high. However, the true test will be at the market, where drunk nobles constantly 'test' the samples - leading to more than one poisoning over the years.  	false
building_flavour_texts_flavour_wh_main_special_bordeleaux_vineyards_4	The countryside of Bordeleaux is lined with vineyards, and those planted on the banks of the River Morceaux are seen as the best of the best.

building_flavour_texts_flavour_wh_main_special_erengrad_port_1	Erengrad's docks are many and dangerous for those that do not belong in the Stevedore's Guild or Gospodar blood. Its workers are mainly of Bretonnian peasant stock for there is a large Bretonnian quarter in the city. These workers have not always got on with the biting winters of Kislev and so have risen up in anger rather than freeze in their hovels, riots that have always been brutality put down by Kossar Militia.	false
building_flavour_texts_flavour_wh_main_special_erengrad_port_2	Erengrad is divided into three main areas, the high city, the low city and the harbour. The harbour is massive, spanning countless docks, wharfs and quays, and all of it in the Guilds' iron grip. The boyars used to control sea traffic, ensuring that correct taxes and bribes were collected, but all that changed following the Chaos Invasion. When the city was rebuilt, the Guild families ensured they had dominance. 	false

That, of course, is assuming he would eventually be defeated. By all accounts, however, he was the greatest warrior to have ever set foot in the world and was forever searching for a worthy opponent - truly, the first Slayer. 	false
building_flavour_texts_flavour_wh_main_special_great_temple_of_ulric	Built in 63 IC by the High Priest Wulcan, the Temple of Ulric has dominated Middenheim for generations. It is a castle as much as a holy shrine and guarded by the Teutogen Guard. From this temple, the Ar-Ulric - the cult's high priest - broadcasts his sermons that preach war, for Ulric is the God of Wolves, Winter and Battle. He was even worshipped by Sigmar himself, during his mortal life.  	false
building_flavour_texts_flavour_wh_main_special_greenskin_vandalisation_1	Orcs and Goblins aren't fussy where they do their business, although, for practical reasons, they do like it somewhere it can be easily shovelled, as the Greenskins view dung as a valuable building material. Saying that, they particularly enjoy having a good poo in enemy settlements, but as more of a statement than for practical reasons. 	false
building_flavour_texts_flavour_wh_main_special_greenskin_vandalisation_2	Orc and Goblin dung heaps are a stable of most Greenskin encampments for various unsanitary reasons. They also like to have a large post-battle "clear out" inside an enemy settlement. That's nothing to do with nerves, for battle doesn't faze Greenskins. No, they like to make sure the defeated enemy has been thoroughly humiliated!	false
building_flavour_texts_flavour_wh_main_special_greenskin_vandalisation_3	There's not too much to say about pillars of poo, other than they are tall and disgusting and, for vanquished foes, the final humiliation! Dwarfs especially take offence at seeing their sacred millennia-old Holds covered in the vile deposits. 	false
building_flavour_texts_flavour_wh_main_special_greenskin_vandalisation_4	Greenskins have always celebrated their gods by creating idols of them. A good few are made from stone, but those of a less permanent nature are created with warm, fly-infested poo. Building such idols in conquered enemy towns and cities is a special insult that the Orcs get a "proper kick out of" too. 	false
building_flavour_texts_flavour_wh_main_special_greenskin_vandalisation_5	Gobbos that get bored of creating idols of their gods also try their hand at recreating other elements of their world view. Trolls are scary to Goblins, as they are often eaten by them, so a Troll face makes sense. Although, for the enemy it's the stench rather than the aesthetics that will probably keep them away!	false
building_flavour_texts_flavour_wh_main_special_high_king_throne_hall	The gigantic chamber that holds the Throne of Power, when it is not at the head of a throng, is a mighty place that even High Elven ambassadors have been impressed and cowed by.

building_flavour_texts_flavour_wh_main_special_marienburg_port_2	Marienburg sits on a delta at the mouth of the Reik as it heads through the cursed marshes and eventually into the Sea of Claws. The city is on a series of marshy islands surrounded by quays and docks, making its populace rich due to the trade income generated. They are so wealthy, in fact, that they bribed themselves out of the Empire in 2429 IC!	false
building_flavour_texts_flavour_wh_main_special_marienburg_port_3	Ever since Westerland seceded from the Empire, there have been disputes over taxes and customs levies. The Empire's duties have been punitive, but in the past merchants passed on such crippling prices to their customers. This, of course, didn't go well with the buying public. So ever since tax levels have waxed and waned depending on the Emperor's and public's mood, black market goods excepted, of course... 	false

It was once home to the court of the Emperor and today it remains Altdorf's largest rival, both politically and economically.

building_flavour_texts_flavour_wh_main_special_nuln_gunnery_school	Nuln is famed for being the home of  the Imperial Gunnery School, a sprawling network of forges and smelteries where veteran gunsmiths manufacture and maintain the Imperial artillery trains. Now, they even maintain Altdorf's own engineering treasures - the remaining steam tanks - which is quite a coup! Many nobles send their artillerymen to the Imperial Gunnery School to learn the art of ballistics and crews trained in the smog-shrouded city are highly valued.	false
building_flavour_texts_flavour_wh_main_special_reiksfort	The Reiksguard were founded during the reign of Wilhelm III, the first of the Princes of Altdorf to become Emperor. The Reiksguard accompanies the Emperor on campaign and during diplomatic and political tours across the Empire and abroad.

building_flavour_texts_flavour_wh_main_talabec_worship_1	In the godly pantheon, Taal is the older brother of Ulric, so the worshippers of both traditionally get on well. The gods themselves do also, according to the Al-Ulric and Taal High Priest. It is for this reason that where there is a shrine to Ulric, it's a sure bet there will be an unassuming, round abode decorated with antlers and animal skulls close by.	false
building_flavour_texts_flavour_wh_main_talabec_worship_2	Temples to Taal are much rarer than his ubiquitous but humble shrines. There are a few, the largest of which can be found in the city that bears his name, Talabheim. There are monasteries also, but no true worshipper of the nature god would build such a lavish pile. Having said that, they have been known to take over such places if they have fallen into disuse - the most infamous example being La Maisontaal in Bretonnia. 	false
building_flavour_texts_flavour_wh_main_teb_port_1	While Dwarfs carve quays out of solid rock, the Orcs and Norse have little more than wooden planks that jut into the sea. Empire wharfs - including those in Sylvania - are generally much sturdier. Since much of their trade comes down the large rivers they need reliable platforms of timber and stone to enable their ships to dock.	false
building_flavour_texts_flavour_wh_main_teb_port_2	There are many harbours in the Old World, as the nations oft use the large flowing rivers to transport goods from one place to another. Even the Empire's great inland cities have some kind of harbour for massive river barges to dock. The most famous of all harbours, perhaps, is in Barak Varr, the sea-gate of the Karaz Ankor. 	false
building_flavour_texts_flavour_wh_main_teb_port_3	Erengrad, Marienburg, Altdorf, Barak Varr, even the Orc pirate forts that riddle the coast by the Dragonback mountains are all built around or contain a series of ports. These are normally places that attract wealth, as they are great trading stations in those rare moments when there is a lull in the eternal war and also home to the fleet when it returns.	false
building_flavour_texts_flavour_wh_main_teb_worship_1	Shrines to the Goddess of War and Strategy are well-tended places, usually set near a fountain. In Tilea and Estalia the fountain and the likeness of Myrmidia â€“ a beautiful young woman in warrior's garb â€“ are one and the same; the fountain spouts from the top of the head, with water following the contours of her cape as an metaphor for shaping the fortunes of war with good strategy.	false
building_flavour_texts_flavour_wh_main_teb_worship_2	Under the stern eye of Myrmidia's ruling council, known as the Archecclesiastium, the temples of the war goddess, patron of soldiers, are kept in stern, disciplined, order. Tithes are collected and passed to the council, who then furnish the better performing temples with the finances required to make their domes and porticos grander still. 	false
building_flavour_texts_flavour_wh_main_vmp_armoury_1	In the time before Sigmar, it was often customary for tribal Chieftains to be buried with their vast wealth, intending to impress their primitive gods in the afterlife.

building_flavour_texts_flavour_wh_main_vmp_armoury_2	The old tribes would keep their most treasured items in reliquaries. It is a custom that has continued all the way through the history of the Empire, even the Grand Theogonist making use of sacred vaults underneath the Grand Temple. Even in Sylvania, old reliquaries installed by the Priests of Morr or Templars of Sigmar are used as weapon stashes against the Vampiric threat.	false
building_flavour_texts_flavour_wh_main_vmp_balefire_1	Balefire braziers are large corroded iron cages, burning with a bright, sickly hellfire. As the smoke billows outwards it spreads across the lands withering trees, scorching grass and drawing the buried dead closer to the surface. It is little wonder that Undead hosts leave such braziers in their wake, for the land will wither and more Undead will come.	false

building_flavour_texts_flavour_wh_main_vmp_bindingcircle_2	Even modest practitioners of Dark Magic must be wary when summoning dark forces from within a circle of binding, for while Dark Magic is subtly different from the arcane lores dedicated to the Ruinous Powers, a wrong word or missed syllable can bring forth something even more dangerous than a Tomb Banshee.	false
building_flavour_texts_flavour_wh_main_vmp_bindingcircle_3	When a Lodestone is placed inside a binding circle, and a Necromancer recites words that haven't been spoken since the Fall of Nehekhara, then the Wight Kings emerge from their burial mounds.

These cemeteries are bound by blessed walls, patrolled by Priests and warded against evil. Even then, such places can be defiled, their tombs robbed and corpses made into soulless puppets for dark masters. The poor are buried more mundanely or flung into charnel pits. Either way, their bodies may rise again as Zombies or Skeletons if left long enough for their flesh to slough away...	false
building_flavour_texts_flavour_wh_main_vmp_cemetary_2	A powerful Necromancer or Vampire can call the long-dead back to serve him. Those buried in the Old World make excellent warriors - they fought in life and can do so again. No Zombies are found here for flesh has long since rotted away, there is just dust, bones, and a willingness to fight again. Summoning the Wight Kings requires more powerful rituals, for they retain their independence and are not easily controlled.	false
building_flavour_texts_flavour_wh_main_vmp_cemetary_3	As well as being statements of wealth, power and status, the mausoleums of the rich and powerful were warded to keep the remains away from prowling ghouls or Dark Magic-users. Of course, in many cases such efforts are futile, for a Vampire is a determined creature with eternity to spare. Some of those within would have fought with, or even against, Sigmar - an irony not lost on the Undead.	false
building_flavour_texts_flavour_wh_main_vmp_forest_1	Like much of the Empire, Sylvania is heavily wooded. Unlike other places though, the trees seem to crave blood. There are many tales of how a hut built too close to a copse was discovered to have a tree roots boring into the bodies of the unfortunates sleeping within. It's not just trees the smallfolk must be wary of, for in those sinister copses the fauna is as blood-hunger as the flora...	false
building_flavour_texts_flavour_wh_main_vmp_forest_2	Sylvanians know not to venture into the woods. Even lumberjacks go only in large parties when wood is at its scarcest, and even then chopping down a tree could easily bring about a bloody retaliation. Of course, there are abyssal things there, even more terrifying than the trees themselves. Such things are sought by the Midnight Aristocracy, who wish to add them to their hordes.	false
building_flavour_texts_flavour_wh_main_vmp_forest_3	The forests of Sylvania are perilous, their rotting canopies housing the deadliest creatures that roam the lands. Nowhere is more despised than Hunger Wood, a collection of briars and bogs to trap the unwary. Legends speak of a whole flock of Terrorgheists residing within its twisted boughs. Should a Vampire Lord find such a menagerie, he could become powerful enough to challenge the von Carsteins' throne.	false
building_flavour_texts_flavour_wh_main_vmp_garrison_1	Piles of cadavers are deposited by Corpse Carts in places that a Vampire or Necromancer wants watched. Occasionally, one or two corpses will pull themselves free from the mire of writhing limbs and shamble forth on a short patrol route before merging back into the pile - assuming there was nothing living to feed off.	false
building_flavour_texts_flavour_wh_main_vmp_garrison_2	Standing sentinel throughout Sylvania are watchtowers.

building_flavour_texts_flavour_wh_main_vmp_necromancers_1	There are many prohibited volumes published and distributed throughout civilisation - some authored by heretics, others by Necromancers who wish to share their diabolical secrets. Even Nagash himself wrote nine tomes of power. Such books tend to be collected by dark archivists, ignorant of the lore they have gathered, or even Witch Hunters who retrieve these blasphemous tomes and store them for 'safekeeping'.	false
building_flavour_texts_flavour_wh_main_vmp_necromancers_2	Necromancers usually start their careers in secret. As they delve into the dark arts, inevitably suspicion is raised as cadavers go missing, milk sours and ominous clouds gather. Some leave in search of a master before being ostracised, others are chased from their former lives. Once outed, a Necromancer will seek out another to continue his dread education, and a lair to continue his vile experiments. 	false
building_flavour_texts_flavour_wh_main_vmp_ossuary_1	In a world of unremitting war, a decent burial is something granted only to the few. For the remainder, a mass grave must suffice, with enough stones on top to deter wild beasts, and enough icons to draw down the blessing of the various gods of the dead. Alas, such charnel pits attract Necromancers and other dark sorcerers like, vultures to carrion.	false

A Vampire Count that excavates such a find will be able to increase his Undead host quickly, as the remains are summoned to join them.	false
building_flavour_texts_flavour_wh_main_vmp_repression_1	Gibbet cages can be found throughout Sylvania - indeed, much of the Old World uses this gruesome punishment for thieves, bandits and other criminals, and as a warning to others who might contemplate such malfeasance. In Sylvania, living is a crime and those that, having displeased the Vampire Counts, arenâ€™t instantly torn to shreds or consumed may end up in a cage, on display as a stark warning, but also as a way of leeching lifeforce from the condemned. Their energy slowly drips away even as Zombies and carrion birds gather to nibble at the remains through the rusted iron bars.	false
building_flavour_texts_flavour_wh_main_vmp_repression_2	Should brigands, Witch Hunters or the living tenants of Sylvania dare to rise against the Midnight Aristocracy, then those not fed to the Crypt Ghouls or given over to the Necromancers may well be sent to the gallows. Such grisly structures are often seen in Sylvaniaâ€™s villages and decrepit townships, a sure sign of the Undead nobilityâ€™s hold over the area and of just how far the peasantry cursed to live in the area are from Sigmarâ€™s light. Those sent to the gallows - a punishment for even the most minor of infractions - are escorted by hooded and gruesome executioners - who knows if they are living or dead servants of the von Carsteins? As sentences are carried out, and the living do their macabre jigs upon the rope, the Wind of Shyish blows ever stronger.	false
building_flavour_texts_flavour_wh_main_vmp_resource_dyes_1	Mercury is in demand throughout the Empire. In its raw form, it can be refined as pigment for clothing and inks. The Gold College will go to extensive lengths to obtain it - including striking secret deals with dark forces. Of course, Sylvanian residents have other uses for mercury, as it works well with Dark Magic - the two things bond extremely well.	false
building_flavour_texts_flavour_wh_main_vmp_resource_dyes_2	The Blood Mines are so called for the cinnabar found in the area. That is not to say that the mines are never awash with blood. Should a Varghulf take residence then there will be half-eaten corpses and streams of bloody gore. Yet the unrefined mercury within is a powerful resource, both domestically and commercially, providing the right sort of factors and intermediaries are used.	false
building_flavour_texts_flavour_wh_main_vmp_resource_dyes_3	Red as a colour is always in demand, for it is the colour of blood, of war and even used by the von Carsteins on their banners. For pigment grinders, red is more ubiquitous than noble purple but more difficult to formulate than brown or green. Sylvanian red is known as "blood red" for obvious reasons.	false
building_flavour_texts_flavour_wh_main_vmp_resource_furs_1	The hunting grounds within the moors and forests of Sylvania see action from poachers, trying to find the odd emaciated hare to put on the table. There are also hunts organised for the nobility. The Midnight Aristocracy make a great show of a hunt, but it isn't small game the Vampires chase, their prey is far more monstrous, and trophies far more advantageous.	false
building_flavour_texts_flavour_wh_main_vmp_resource_furs_2	Poaching Camps are forbidden by dread landlords who have long since forgotten the need to eat in the conventional sense. However, peasants can become so desperate that to hunt on von Carstein land is their only option. Of course, survival, even in a larger party, is far from guaranteed, even without the threat that their Vampire overlord will find out!	false
building_flavour_texts_flavour_wh_main_vmp_resource_furs_3	The flayer is a creature of Sylvanian folklore, a nursery rhyme monster to keep children in their beds. Yet deep in the woods it lurks, ready to do the bidding of the Vampire Counts, ready to bring the hides and skins of various beasts and to punish the smallfolk by skinning them alive - should they displease their Undead overlords.	false
building_flavour_texts_flavour_wh_main_vmp_resource_gold_1	Gold can be found in Sylvania's mountains but it is always tarnished, as if ruined by its proximity to Warpstone. Even so, tarnished gold can find markets further into Stirland and even Ostermark. Still, Sylvania is bordered by the World's Edge Mountains, those very same seams where Dwarfs find their gold and gems... 	false
building_flavour_texts_flavour_wh_main_vmp_resource_gold_2	Larger seams of tarnished gold benefit from a grander infrastructure - dank mines are established and run throughout the day and night, as Zombie workers tirelessly hack into the mountain to bring the black-hearted noble his mound of tarnished gold.	false
building_flavour_texts_flavour_wh_main_vmp_resource_gold_3	There are a few smelteries within Sylvania, although the vast majority of its blackened gold is shipped out to provinces where skilled goldsmiths are able to make the best of it. Even so, smelteries under the Vampires' dominion produce a gold with a greenish sheen. Dwarfs reject such material outright, but Vampires enjoy the aesthetic, and even take pride in it.	false
building_flavour_texts_flavour_wh_main_vmp_resource_iron_1	Deep in the caverns that riddle Sylvania's mountains are the black iron pits - noxious, scabrous places where black iron ore can be found next to hunks of raw Warpstone. Peasants are sent in as punishment and rarely emerge alive or... unchanged. It is perhaps a blessing to be slain first and then sent into the pit as a fleshy puppet than alive.	false
building_flavour_texts_flavour_wh_main_vmp_resource_iron_2	When a Vampire or Necromancer discovers a seam of black iron or something more valuable such as Warpstone, then they will send in Zombies to rend the ore from the mountains. Zombies have many advantages over the living in this regard, as they don't require pay, or rest, or indeed any kind of safety considerations!	false
building_flavour_texts_flavour_wh_main_vmp_resource_iron_3	A scoured iron mine is one where such a seam of cursed iron is discovered. Only the Undead can mine this, for mortals will be mutated by the iron within. The ore is priceless, sought by Necromancers from across the world to fuel the darkest experiments. There are also other creatures that crave such material - red eyed and be-tailed, but we do not talk about them...	false
building_flavour_texts_flavour_wh_main_vmp_resource_iron_military	The forges in the bowels of Sylvania's castles may have once been used like any other, to produce good castle-forged steel to arm Stirland's soldiery, but that has changed since the coming of the Vampires. Now the forges are unholy relics, burning with the heat of a thousand cursed souls - now Sylvania's unholy forges serve the Vampire Counts.	false
building_flavour_texts_flavour_wh_main_vmp_resource_marble_1	The workshops of Sylvanian stone cutters - often known locally as Brimstone Cutters, for they build the lairs of fiends - are full of large cutting blades and grinding machines. Such contraptions are taken or bought from itinerant imperial engineers who have more interest in seeing their contrivance working over who actually ends up owning them and for what ends.	false
building_flavour_texts_flavour_wh_main_vmp_resource_marble_2	Tombstone makers are never short of work. Peasants can rarely afford such ostentatious graves, and are lucky to receive any kind of burial marking except maybe a small hammer or comet marker if they are lucky. It is the von Carsteins and their ilk who contract the tombstone makers and demand grand edifices and mausoleums for their private vaults.	false
building_flavour_texts_flavour_wh_main_vmp_resource_marble_3	In the poor, dingy townships there are garrets where sculptors make their living, fashioning stone into grim and gregarious creatures. There are far more gargoyles perching on the gothic walls, gatehouses and ramparts than could conceivably be fashioned by all the craftsmen in the Empire. Where do they come from? Only the Vampire Counts truly know.  	false
building_flavour_texts_flavour_wh_main_vmp_resource_pastures_1	The parts of Sylvania not covered by blackened moors or twisted forests have fields of withering crops. Nothing good can grow in Sylvania, yet the smallfolk must make a living as well as eat. They tend the cursed fields, growing stunted crops of pathetic yields and bare grazing for the skinny cattle to feed on. 	false
building_flavour_texts_flavour_wh_main_vmp_resource_pastures_2	The peasants have known for years that their landlords are Undead monsters, but to acknowledge it is to bring down ruination. As such, they continue to live under a pall of servitude and darkness, never being rich enough to move away. They collect what harvests they can, always knowing a von Carstein or his minions may summon them to the castle at any time.	false
building_flavour_texts_flavour_wh_main_vmp_resource_pastures_3	The black bread of Sylvania is an acquired taste. Its loaves are black and lumpen; the flour coming from the haunted mills, whose weed-swaddled water wheels turn at night to produce a course meal of grain and ground bone. The bread tastes abominably sour. Nevertheless, the loaves are sold and consumed by the hungry populace.	false
building_flavour_texts_flavour_wh_main_vmp_resource_pottery_1	Found close to the salt marshes, and in the stinking bogs that clog up the streams feeding into the River Aver and the River Stir, are clay pits. This dense clay, when mixed with ground bone, can create a surprisingly good base material for potters, urn makers and such like.	false
building_flavour_texts_flavour_wh_main_vmp_resource_pottery_2	Urns of Sylvania are powerful artefacts in their own right, made and decorated by adding baroque and gothic trappings. Once fired in the screeching kilns, they are enchanted to hold the remains of powerful beings, Vampire Lords, Ghoul Kings and even the spiritual essence of ancient warriors. Such urns can find themselves at the centre of Mortis Engines, such is their arcane might.	false
building_flavour_texts_flavour_wh_main_vmp_resource_pottery_3	Screeching kilns can only be found in the potteries of Sylvania. Why they screech is a bit of mystery - perhaps the ground bones' owners are freed by the heat? Maybe there are Tomb Banshees trapped inside or some other restless spirit burning as punishment? Such a thing is not beyond the dark imaginings of Mannfred von Carstein!	false
building_flavour_texts_flavour_wh_main_vmp_resource_salt_1	Brackish water, no doubt contaminated by Warpstone, forms in rivers and streams and in stagnant bodies throughout Sylvania. On top float skulls, dead rats and other foul things that would make it an interesting aside for any of Nurgle's followers. Underneath the surface, live the things of nightmares.	false
building_flavour_texts_flavour_wh_main_vmp_resource_salt_2	Salt is a commodity that has value outside the realm of Sylvania, where people use it to season their food. Vampires sell it to mortals through various factors and underhand merchants. The smallfolk are sent onto the marshes to harvest the salt, but hazards abound - clutching hands in the ground and Tomb Banshees that patrol the desolate marshes in a mournful stupor. 	false
building_flavour_texts_flavour_wh_main_vmp_resource_salt_3	The dead marches are home to many of the salt marshes in Sylvania's bounds. In their centre lies the salt pans, covered in a field of bleached bones. For living things to get to the salt pans is all but impossible; Zombies make the taxing journey on their masters' behalf - the irony being that it is likely they were once the original salt collectors! 	false
building_flavour_texts_flavour_wh_main_vmp_resource_timber_1	Timber is required for building materials, fencing and many other reasons, even in Sylvania. Stout Talabecland oak is hard to come by, so denizens must put up with the twisted, rotting wood from Sylvania's dense and hazardous forests. A forester of Sylvanian origin in the employ of the Midnight Aristocracy is given certain privileges, allowing him to enter the copses largely undisturbed.	false
building_flavour_texts_flavour_wh_main_vmp_resource_timber_2	At the turn of second millennium, the Elector Count of Stirland invested heavily in sawmills, as he saw wood as the future - an ever-renewable resource. A few years later a Sylvanian noble, Vlad, was unveiled as a creature of the night and the Vampire Wars began. The Elector's timber enterprise was in tatters, his network of sawmills left to ruin.	false
building_flavour_texts_flavour_wh_main_vmp_resource_timber_3	Should the provenance of a Sylvanian object or resource be uncovered it is shunned by most, destroyed on sight by many others. Dwarfs especially hate anything made by Sylvanian hands, living or no. The dark timber is secreted onto the market by merchant spies and greedy factors, who store it in abandoned sheds, far from trade routes and out of sight of the Emperor's Road Wardens.	false
building_flavour_texts_flavour_wh_main_vmp_resource_timber_4	Deeper in Hunger Wood is an old barn, decrepit in age, its original use long forgotten. Inside are rows upon rows of furs, the hides of myriad creatures, and the stench of death. Fallen timber piles up around it - no man has been there in years - and yet something lives there, for no one has dared take the potentially valuable - if hideous - contents.	false

building_flavour_texts_flavour_wh_main_vmp_resource_wine_1	Blood Grapes are unique to Sylvania, found in the tangled and thorn-ridden vine patches in the south. If fermented properly the grapes make a full-bodied vintage, deeply red and rich in iron. Never mind that the occasional grape will contain a dead sparrow or shrivelled finger instead of a seed.	false
building_flavour_texts_flavour_wh_main_vmp_resource_wine_2	While crops always struggle to grow in Sylvania, its trees are rigorous and thrive in often harsh conditions. The low hung and thorny apple trees can provide surprisingly good yields, but farmers must be quick, for the fruits ripen and rot on the branch extremely quickly, attracting large flies who lay maggots that have far too many teeth.	false
building_flavour_texts_flavour_wh_main_vmp_resource_wine_3	Whether made from Sylvanian blood grapes, or simply the rancid gore of peasant cadavers, the animated winepress does most of the labour - crushing body or grape and fermenting and refining. Zombies are there to lift and carry but the spirit entrapped within the device is the true expert.	false
building_flavour_texts_flavour_wh_main_vmp_settlement_major_1	Hamlets are usually a lone group of hovels on a muddy, rutted road in the middle of the dour countryside. Despite the desperate state of the buildings, all have barred or boarded windows and surprisingly stout doors. On the roofs, wicked iron spikes emerge from the thatch. All to keep out the night's predators.	false
building_flavour_texts_flavour_wh_main_vmp_settlement_major_2	Sylvanian villages are in a constant state of disrepair, for good stone and wood is hard to come by. Crude fetishes and the charms hang on every lintel and frame. Villagers daub symbols of protection on their doors with pig's blood and roofs are laid with mantraps, spikes and far worse to ward off anything that might coming prowling in the night.	false
building_flavour_texts_flavour_wh_main_vmp_settlement_major_3	Hanging outside the decrepit townships' gates and walls are criminals and travellers trapped in iron maidens, feeding the crows and vampire bats. To be a stranger in such a town is to invite hostile stares from the locals, and mention "Sigmar" or the "Emperor" and you will find yourself dangling before nightfall, as such demagoguery could bring the von Carstein wrath upon you all!	false
building_flavour_texts_flavour_wh_main_vmp_settlement_major_4	Sylvania does not have any settlement that can truly be called a city, Vampire Counts have captured cities and declared them part of their realm. Any surviving occupants quickly feel the creeping dread, as friends and family go missing, Dire Wolves hunt the silent streets and Zombies shamble in the open. A perpetual night dominates the skyline; those still living think themselves accursed and the truth is... they are.	false
building_flavour_texts_flavour_wh_main_vmp_settlement_major_5	In the time of Sigmar, Sylvania was a refuge for those who refused to follow the Unberogen banner, so there have always been castles in the area to oversee this sorry part of Stirland. When Vlad got his claws into the realm, its destitute nobles were turned to the Vampire's cause; castles took on a sinister aspect, growing in size as extra citadels and towers were added for fell rituals and dark designs.	false
building_flavour_texts_flavour_wh_main_vmp_vampires_1	A Vampire's tomb lies deep within the crypts of his castle, or his master's domain, should the Vampire be in thrall to a more powerful being of the bloodline. Soon after receiving the Blood Kiss, a nascent Vampire will need to feed and then seek seclusion as its body is wracked with changes and Dark Magic.	false
building_flavour_texts_flavour_wh_main_vmp_vampires_2	Among the dread towers and gargoyles of Sylvania's castles are its keeps - the sanctuaries from where the Vampire Lord will entertain his allies or unwary mortals, and make his fell plans for domination of the living. The Midnight Aristocracy are of noble stock and so enjoy doing what nobles tend to do - entertain and plot. 	false
building_flavour_texts_flavour_wh_main_vmp_walls_1	A ghost fence is a barrier with little physical substance - merely a series of poles or posts upon which are hung accursed fetishes and totems to which Daemonic and Undead spirits have been bound with forbidden spells. Only a brave or foolish warrior crosses a ghost fence without good cause - or without powerful protective wards.	false
building_flavour_texts_flavour_wh_main_vmp_walls_2	Not all creatures are raised back to join a Vampire's Undead horde, for bone is a useful material. Larger walls that mark boundaries around Vampire strongholds are often made from the bones and skulls of former enemies. Such a terrifying structure will make an invader think twice about climbing it, especially when the embedded skulls begin to scream! 	false
building_flavour_texts_flavour_wh_main_vmp_walls_3	The great curtain walls of Sylvania's Castles are massive bulwarks of stone, compacted bone and cursed relics, topped by leering gargoyles. They make any potential siege a formidable prospect, especially when such walls are guarded by observers that never tire, and will always stand ready to repulse any foolish mortal invaders. 	false
building_flavour_texts_flavour_wh_pro02_vmp_isabella_unique	Otto von Drak was the father of Isabella, noted for his degenerate madness â€“ the final act of which was the joining of his hitherto selfish, immoral daughter to Vlad von Carstein. Although he did not personally know the suitor, Otto agreed the union to prevent his twisted brother, Leopold, from ascending to the throne, in an instant ensuring that the chaos of uncertainty did not befall the Drakenwald in the absence of a male heir. Little did he know that this marriage of convenience would blossom into the greatest of loves, defying time and dust to endure in obsessive devotion and eternal bliss. Isabella has not forgotten her beloved father, despite the centuries, and looks back upon his final act as the true beginning of her own life. So that the Mad Count â€“ as he was frequently known â€“ should always be remembered, she had his corpse interred inside a splendid chamber, dedicated to his life and achievements, so that the smallfolk may show suitable reverence.	false
