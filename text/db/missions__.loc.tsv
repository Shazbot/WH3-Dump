missions_localised_description_wh2_dlc09_books_of_nagash_1	Firstborn of King Khetep, Nagash was overlooked for succession and forced to join the Mortuary Cult. He swiftly rose to become a powerful high priest, but envy of his brother, who succeeded their father as king, burned within Nagash like a brazier coal. Seizing his opportunity, he entombed his brother, Thutep, alive and claimed the throne for himself - thus began Nagash's reign of sorcerous terror.	false
missions_localised_description_wh2_dlc09_books_of_nagash_2	But a throne would not suffice for the insatiable Sorcerer. Seeking greater power, he threw himself into the study of Dark Magic, melding it with Necromancy to unlock the very secrets of eternal life. He poured all he had learned into his blasphemous opus, the nine Books of Nagash. The next stage of his plan, if successful, would magnify his powers immeasurably... 	false
missions_localised_description_wh2_dlc09_books_of_nagash_3	Nagash then constructed a vast black pyramid to harness and channel the Winds of Magic. Upon its completion, Nagash felt his powers grow tenfold, though the cost to the Kingdom was ruinous. Even as his might surged, the outraged Nehekharan Priest Kings gathered in secret, devising a way to topple the sorcerous tyrant.	false
missions_localised_description_wh2_dlc09_books_of_nagash_4	The Priest Kings mustered mighty armies and declared war, but to their horror Nagash raised countless regiments of Skeleton Warriors in reply. Realising flesh alone could not to defeat such horrors, the Priest Kings breathed life into the mightiest statues of Nehekhara. Stone Ushabti, Necrolith Colossi and Khemrian Warsphinxes fought alongside the living, and Nagash's legions were crushed, forcing him to flee. However, is Nehekhara finally rid of his evil?	false
missions_localised_description_wh2_dlc09_books_of_nagash_5	Order finally returned to Nehekhara, but it was many years until the kingdom prospered again, under the rule of King Alcadizaar. The Mortuary Cult was held under close scrutiny, its researches severely curtailed lest there be a repetition of Nagash's horrors. Many years passed in peace, until Nagash seemed but a dark and distant memory.	false
missions_localised_description_wh2_dlc09_books_of_nagash_6	All was not seemly well in the Nehekharan city of Lahmia, however. Spellbound by the Sorcerer's legacy, Queen Neferata recreated his Elixir of Life, though her method was flawed (she and her court gained eternal life, but were cursed with an insatiable thirst for blood). Their dabblings aroused the fury of King Alcadizaar, and the Lahmians fled in search of refuge.	false
missions_localised_description_wh2_dlc09_books_of_nagash_7	Little did these first Vampires know, Nagash's dark will had guided their actions all along. They found themselves at his fortress of Nagashizzar, where the perfidious Sorcerer welcomed his twisted children with open arms. Together, they launched a fresh offensive against Nehekhara, catching the recovering kingdom unawares.	false
missions_localised_description_wh2_dlc09_books_of_nagash_8	Nehekhara rallied its forces in defence, and the war ground on for many years, seemingly deadlocked. After a titanic effort, however, Alcadizaar finally smashed the Undead forces. The Vampires fled to new refuges in the Old World, while Nagash retreated once more in abject fury. This time, his wrath was absolute – he cast a foul contagion throughout Nehekhara, scouring it of all life. Only Alcadizaar did he spare to witness the horror.	false
missions_localised_description_wh2_dlc09_books_of_nagash_9	Incarcerated and fading, King Alcadizaar was visited in his cell one night by a group of cloaked, twitching, rat-like creatures. They whispered to him and freed him, pressing a Warpstone blade into his trembling hands. Ascending to the dark Sorcerer's altar, the emaciated king caught Nagash mid-ritual: he bellowed a final war-cry and ran the sorcerer through with the crackling blade. It was over at last, though Nehekhara lay in ruins. But can such reckless hatred ever truly be extinguished?	false

missions_localised_description_wh2_dlc11_mis_cst_declare_war_vmp	Now, we'd be a little naive if we trusted the Vampire Counts, kin or no. Like us pirates, they 'ave the 'abit of betrayal - a hard one to break I'm sure you'll agree. We should vanquish them with haste and bring their armies under our thrall!	false
missions_localised_description_wh2_dlc11_mis_cst_declare_war_wef	Looks like the tides have brought *total* war to our shores. Each day that passes, it's gettin' closer, so we must act now. Bury the Asrai beneath the waves - they'll think twice 'bout leavin' their tree 'ouses after that!	false
missions_localised_description_wh2_dlc11_mis_cst_diplomatic_assassinate_character	This lily-livered landlubber has a price on their head, which makes 'em something of an attractive target for salty freebooters such as we. Taking this life means we'll be able to claim a generous reward - I'm in, are you?	false
missions_localised_description_wh2_dlc11_mis_cst_diplomatic_capture_region	This place will make a handy base from which to launch all sorts of raids an' actions. If we capture this region and fly our colours 'ere, our pirate brothers-in-arms will support us, I knows it.	false
missions_localised_description_wh2_dlc11_mis_cst_diplomatic_eliminate_character_in_battle	This foe is an enemy of all our kind, so we much face 'em in combat and end their run. Think of it as an symbolic and existential battle - one we absolutely cannot afford to lose.	false
missions_localised_description_wh2_dlc11_mis_cst_diplomatic_engage_force	I don't like this lot and I know you don't either, so I'm proposing that we take the fight directly to their door, 'cos a victory here could well be crucial during the wars to come. Are yer with me?	false
missions_localised_description_wh2_dlc11_mis_cst_diplomatic_raid_region	Cor, blimey! This place is ripe for the picking with loot and plunder of all kinds - we should strip it clean in Stromfels' name!	false
missions_localised_description_wh2_dlc11_mis_cst_diplomatic_raze_sack_settlement	Our enemies think they 'ave the edge, but you an' I know differently - destroying this place of theirs will deal them a heavy blow, make no mistake. Shall we burn it all down and take their trinkets for ourselves?	false
missions_localised_description_wh2_dlc11_mis_cst_eliminate_character_in_battle_faction_leader_brt	Ahhh the fancy king of Bretonnia, with 'is - admittedly really quite lovely - suit of armour and 'is pious devotion to that old hag. He thinks 'imself untouchable, yer know! We should rend 'im in two - break the illusion of infallibility and crush the false hope he gives to his people! Let's see 'im talk of destiny with an axe through his 'ead!	false
missions_localised_description_wh2_dlc11_mis_cst_eliminate_character_in_battle_faction_leader_bst	The leader of that stupid herd of Beastmen has reared its particularly 'ungry 'ead once again. I say we lop it orft and watch 'is Gors crumble. I'd like to see 'em try to hunt without 'im - they'll be chargin' 'round in circles, attackin' each other. Free entertainment! Hilarious!	false
missions_localised_description_wh2_dlc11_mis_cst_eliminate_character_in_battle_faction_leader_chs	The Dark Gods' lackies swarm around a single leader, who 'imself is obsessed with their grace and favour. This will make our job quite a lot simpler - his death will be the end for these armies of Chaos, so we need to kill this so-called 'Everchosen' in battle, and soon, afore the whole bally lot of 'em show up and we're in bit of a pickle!	false
missions_localised_description_wh2_dlc11_mis_cst_eliminate_character_in_battle_faction_leader_cst	Ahh, Luthor Harkon - the ruler of the so-called Vampire Coast, no less. I say we throw 'im all the way down to Stromfels' Chest for the arrogance he's shown, or maybe we send 'im back to The Awakening as just another lifeless corpse to be raised an' bound? Either option works for me!	false
missions_localised_description_wh2_dlc11_mis_cst_eliminate_character_in_battle_faction_leader_def	That prissy, long streak o'seaweed, the ruler of the lanky Dark Elves, is little more than hot air in a barrel. I say we end his reign and the send the Druchii into a panic. Then, we can just pick 'em off like fish in said same barrel. Job done and off to Sartosa for a slap-up feast and grog for all the boys! Yarrr!!	false
missions_localised_description_wh2_dlc11_mis_cst_eliminate_character_in_battle_faction_leader_dwf	The Dwarf Lord? Do me a favour! He's no more than a petty, bitter librarian consumed by imagined slights an' supposed insults. He's also really, really short, which many of the lads find 'ysterical. We should crush 'im and then write the final entry in 'is blood!	false
missions_localised_description_wh2_dlc11_mis_cst_eliminate_character_in_battle_faction_leader_emp	Wow, the emperor 'imself has shown up! That must mean we're doin' something right. Remember he's just a politician, really, 'oo plays at being a warrior. I say we meet 'im in battle so 'e can see first hand that dead pirates cannot be swayed by fancy cloaks an' pretty words.	false
missions_localised_description_wh2_dlc11_mis_cst_eliminate_character_in_battle_faction_leader_grn	Oh look - the big boss of the Greenskins has graced us with 'is presence. Like all his kind, he's too stubborn to die and too stupid to retreat in the face of a force like ours! If we can't kill this one, we should bury 'im under an endless zombie horde - either way, he must be dealt with before sundown.	false
missions_localised_description_wh2_dlc11_mis_cst_eliminate_character_in_battle_faction_leader_hef	The greatest swordsman in all of Ulthuan 'e may be, but he's still mortal, which we can all agree puts 'im at something of a disadvantage. Shall we introduce the fool to the Gunnery Mob? A dozen or two blunderbusses to the face oughta end this so-called 'sword master'!	false
missions_localised_description_wh2_dlc11_mis_cst_eliminate_character_in_battle_faction_leader_lzd	As powerful as it is ancient, so they say - the 'ead of all the Lizardmen.

missions_localised_description_wh2_dlc11_mis_cst_eliminate_character_in_battle_faction_leader_nor	The leader of those pathetic Norscans is said to be an accomplished warrior who 'as travelled many a sea. Whether or not that be true - and I suspect it's just flannel as he's just a walking beard really - we should remain cautious. I say we do not take 'im lightly but do take 'is head, yarrr!!	false
missions_localised_description_wh2_dlc11_mis_cst_eliminate_character_in_battle_faction_leader_skv	The 'Headtaker' - yep, I know, the arrogance of the thing - is apparently the greatest warrior those cowardly ratmen have to offer. If this be true, then slaying 'im in battle will crush the morale of 'is whole pathetic, ratty race. Couldn’t come soon enough if you ask me!	false
missions_localised_description_wh2_dlc11_mis_cst_eliminate_character_in_battle_faction_leader_tmb	Ahhh, our old friend the king of self-congratulation - a legend in 'is own lunch hour - is drawn up in front of us with an army. A shame, as we could've 'atched a few lucrative schemes with the Tomb Kings, but instead we're gonna 'ave to kill the lot of 'em. Let's grind 'is army into the dust!	false
missions_localised_description_wh2_dlc11_mis_cst_eliminate_character_in_battle_faction_leader_vmp	There's nothin' like a good, honest, vengeful rivalry… and this is nothin' like one! Your Unlivin' rival's petty machinations are growing tedious and unimaginative - killin' him in battle will free us from this walkin' annoyance and free up 'is victims to be killed, raised an' bound by us!	false
missions_localised_description_wh2_dlc11_mis_cst_eliminate_character_in_battle_faction_leader_wef	They call 'im 'Ariel's Chosen', but when it comes down to it he's little more than a sea dog, but not a good one - a pathetic whelp who'll be easily overcome I'm sure. We should take the battle to 'em before the midwinter pyre robs us of the chance to strike a crushing blow to the Asrai's morale!	false
missions_localised_description_wh2_dlc11_mis_cst_eliminate_character_in_battle_high_rank_brt	Ha! The Bretonnians really are the limit! This foolish 'champion' of sorts believes that their mythical 'Lady' will protect 'em from us! Let's show all those who follow false gods that none can withstand Death's cold embrace! Well, except you of course - you're Unlivin' proof you are.	false
missions_localised_description_wh2_dlc11_mis_cst_eliminate_character_in_battle_high_rank_bst	Oh 'ere we go - more grunting an' nonsense from the beasts o'Chaos.

missions_localised_description_wh2_dlc11_mis_cst_eliminate_character_in_battle_high_rank_chs	It appears that the Dark Gods are playing their tedious games with yet another simpleton - he believes they actually expect 'im to triumph in battle - against us!! Can you believe the stupidity? I say we kill 'im quickly and put an end to this miserable tale!	false
missions_localised_description_wh2_dlc11_mis_cst_eliminate_character_in_battle_high_rank_cst	Our rivals think they can challenge our power, so we must assert our dominance, lest every scurvy-ridden sea dog on the ocean believes they too can turn on us. Kill their leader in battle, then all will see that it is us an' us alone who rule the waves of this world! 	false
missions_localised_description_wh2_dlc11_mis_cst_eliminate_character_in_battle_high_rank_def	The weasely Druchii believe that it is they who harbour the lords of dread, but we know different like, don't we? Let's prove their misconceptions to be falsehoods - Show 'em the true meaning of dread - slay this leader of theirs in full view of their men!	false
missions_localised_description_wh2_dlc11_mis_cst_eliminate_character_in_battle_high_rank_dwf	Normally, I’d be dead bored by this point, but as it turns out, this Dwarf has proven to be quite fierce. Not a problem for a vicious, murdering bunch of pirate scum like us though is it? And killin' him should deal a significant blow to 'is declining race! Let's do it!	false
missions_localised_description_wh2_dlc11_mis_cst_eliminate_character_in_battle_high_rank_emp	This Imperial type has proven popular among both his men an' the Empire's diplomats, such as they are. I reckon that killing 'im and raising his corpse will shake the whole of man's realm to its stupid, cowardly core! Let's spill some blood - pass my bill 'ook, Bernie!	false
missions_localised_description_wh2_dlc11_mis_cst_eliminate_character_in_battle_high_rank_grn	Though 'tis well known that Greenskins are stupid an' pointless, this particular specimen has been developin' somethin' of a reputation among 'is kind as an apt killer. If that be the case, we should kill 'im in battle an' break the morale of 'is boys - they'll crumble in no time, you mark my words!	false
missions_localised_description_wh2_dlc11_mis_cst_eliminate_character_in_battle_high_rank_hef	The High Elves may well be famed for their martial prowess, but no matter how talented they are, sheer numbers will eventually break even the greatest warrior. Prove that to the Asur by saddlin' up the Undead horde and sendin' 'em out.	false
missions_localised_description_wh2_dlc11_mis_cst_eliminate_character_in_battle_high_rank_lzd	I like to think of the Lizardmen as a single, giant snake - cut the head orft an' they'll flop about a bit, then breathe no more. If they dare to move against us again, we should kill their leader, sit back and 'ave a few rums whilst they flail and flounder.	false
missions_localised_description_wh2_dlc11_mis_cst_eliminate_character_in_battle_high_rank_nor	This Norscan 'champion', it would appear, has managed - unbelievably - to attract the attention of 'is fickle gods, the Ruinous Powers, an' has gained a name for 'imself as a warrior who does not fear death in any of its guises. He may not fear 'is end, but he would do well to fear what happens afterwards!	false
missions_localised_description_wh2_dlc11_mis_cst_eliminate_character_in_battle_high_rank_skv	The Skaven - as a whole, you understand - are like a ship without a keel: totally spineless. This particular specimen may well have risen through their verminous ranks, but that's of little merit really. I say we kill this ratman - in fact, let's kill 'em all, every last man rat of 'em!	false
missions_localised_description_wh2_dlc11_mis_cst_eliminate_character_in_battle_high_rank_tmb	This Tomb King believes it is our equal in battle, but several ages 'ave passed since they were top o'the food chain.

missions_localised_description_wh2_dlc11_mis_cst_eliminate_character_in_battle_high_rank_vmp	Our landlocked cousins believe themselves to be superior, even though they just sit there in the dark whilst we're out piratin' for profit! Killing this particular one would serve as a suitable warnin' to others who might want to challenge our dominance. Let's do 'em - as a warning like!	false
missions_localised_description_wh2_dlc11_mis_cst_eliminate_character_in_battle_high_rank_wef	They say that the forests an' woodlands of Athel Loren are burstin' with life - that's even more livin' for us to choke the life out of then, no? We should start by plucking this 'ere weed - sorry, did I say 'weed'? I meant Asrai leader!	false
missions_localised_description_wh2_dlc11_mis_cst_engage_force_army_brt	Those mortals of Bretonnia ride atop their steeds, thinkin' themselves all unstoppable like.

Let's get down to it - there's much killin' to be done!	false
missions_localised_description_wh2_dlc11_mis_cst_engage_force_army_bst	Ere we go again! They are certainly relentless, those tinkers the Beastmen, but they've been roaming around the land for far too long, unchecked. It's time we met 'em in battle and put an end to their hunt once an' for all - what say ye?	false
missions_localised_description_wh2_dlc11_mis_cst_engage_force_army_chs	The armies of Chaos march this way, believing themselves chosen by the Dark Gods and tasked with bringin' about the End Times.

missions_localised_description_wh2_dlc11_mis_cst_engage_force_army_cst	Rival pirates have gathered a mighty crew, the cheeky bunch o'beggars! Let's greet 'em with a broadside that will shiver their timbers an' rattle their stinkin' Undead bones, yarrrr!!!	false
missions_localised_description_wh2_dlc11_mis_cst_engage_force_army_def	So, those lanky, cunning Dark Elves have put together a great army in the hope that we'll cave. Naturally, we won't - let's destroy this cruel host before it can get the upper hand!	false
missions_localised_description_wh2_dlc11_mis_cst_engage_force_army_dwf	Ah, Dwarfs - my favourite, you know. I like 'em boiled with just a little salt an' vinegar! Oh, I do like a good feed - let's go an' pick up dinner!	false
missions_localised_description_wh2_dlc11_mis_cst_engage_force_army_emp	Manann blesses us this day, me hearties - the Empire have sent an army of their very best living men to face us. Let's not muck about - 'ow about we kill 'em quickly and reinforce our ranks 'n' ratings?	false
missions_localised_description_wh2_dlc11_mis_cst_engage_force_army_grn	Eads up, lads - 'ere come the Greenskins, literally 'mob-'anded' and 'ungry for… well, their own deaths, I reckon, once our Gunnery Mobs get stuck in and cut 'em in two!	false
missions_localised_description_wh2_dlc11_mis_cst_engage_force_army_hef	Those 'igh 'n' mighty High Elves mean to meet us in battle with an elite 'ost no less! Well, I dunno 'bout you but I wouldn't wanna disappoint them - let's march forth and give 'em more than a good run for their money!	false
missions_localised_description_wh2_dlc11_mis_cst_engage_force_army_invading_brt	These Bretonnian fools have promised the impossible – an errantry war against death itself!

missions_localised_description_wh2_dlc11_mis_cst_engage_force_army_invading_bst	The Beastmen have dared to enter territory that everybody knows belongs to us - the little scamps!

missions_localised_description_wh2_dlc11_mis_cst_engage_force_army_invading_chs	Like clockwork, the armies of Chaos 'ave arrived, seeking to destroy all we've built up o'er the years. Yep - I agree, it is unacceptable behaviour. We should meet them in battle and see to their immediate destruction.	false
missions_localised_description_wh2_dlc11_mis_cst_engage_force_army_invading_cst	A band of rival pirates 'ave invaded our land and are looking to take our loot for 'emselves! Cheek like this simply cannot stand! We need to block off their retreat and finish them in battle once and for all!	false
missions_localised_description_wh2_dlc11_mis_cst_engage_force_army_invading_def	Dark Elves 'ave marched into lands that all 'ere know are rightly ours.

missions_localised_description_wh2_dlc11_mis_cst_engage_force_army_invading_dwf	The Dwarfs have invaded our land - these stunted fools come seeking our territory but all they'll find is their own doom! Yarrr! March against 'em - turn 'em into steaks for our tea!	false
missions_localised_description_wh2_dlc11_mis_cst_engage_force_army_invading_emp	The Empire might claim these lands as their own, but the fools don't realise that we acquired this prize fair an' square, like, and we will not relinquish it without a fight. So, let's go to battle!	false
missions_localised_description_wh2_dlc11_mis_cst_engage_force_army_invading_grn	They're nothin' if not persistent, those dirty little Greenskins. They've come here, to *our* land and seek battle. I saw we give 'em what they want an' preferably more than they can 'andle!	false
missions_localised_description_wh2_dlc11_mis_cst_engage_force_army_invading_hef	Those highfalutin, lanky landlubber, the High Elves, 'ave sent an army to our lands, bless their cotton socks.

missions_localised_description_wh2_dlc11_mis_cst_engage_force_army_invading_lzd	Those snaky Lizardmen are invading! Trouble is, at one point all this belonged to 'em, so they've got the arse 'bout our presence 'ere. I reckon that we need to push 'em back before they can undo all our progress in these parts!	false
missions_localised_description_wh2_dlc11_mis_cst_engage_force_army_invading_nor	Those dirty Norscan dogs 'ave invaded our lands - *our* lands, the cheeky swines. Let's seek 'em out and send 'em back to the frozen north from whence they came!	false
missions_localised_description_wh2_dlc11_mis_cst_engage_force_army_invading_skv	You've really gotta watch 'em like a hawk - those tenacious ratmen have burrowed their way into our lands. Let's take the breath from their bodies and break this host into lots o'little rat pieces! Yarrr!!	false
missions_localised_description_wh2_dlc11_mis_cst_engage_force_army_invading_tmb	The stinkin', untrustworthy Tomb Kings have gathered together their armies of old and moved 'em against us. Seems a bit unfair - after all, we just want loot an' power - that's not too much to ask it is? Let's meet 'em in battle an' ensure they do not march again.	false
missions_localised_description_wh2_dlc11_mis_cst_engage_force_army_invading_vmp	The sneaky, but nevertheless namby-pamby milksops, the Vampire Counts, have raised their own Undead force and march into our lands. Clearly this is more than a bit naughty - it is unacceptable. We've allowed them to exist alongside us for long enough; this affront will be their final mistake – let's get to battle!	false
missions_localised_description_wh2_dlc11_mis_cst_engage_force_army_invading_wef	The Asrai - that's Wood Elves to you uneducated lot - 'ave got off the fence led their armies against us in an invasion of our lands, their armies bolstered by tree-spirits, whatever they are. This move will be their undoing, however, as the rot of death seeps into their wooden allies we'll seek their destruction! Prepare for battle!	false
missions_localised_description_wh2_dlc11_mis_cst_engage_force_army_lzd	The Lizardmen have raised an army - no doubt what's on their minds is mashin' us up into a pulp. I know, I know - like they 'ave a hope, especially with Stromfels and Manann at our backs. I saw we attack now before they're good an' ready. 	false
missions_localised_description_wh2_dlc11_mis_cst_engage_force_army_nor	If you tired of the Norscans, chances are you're tired of killin' - they've raised something of a force, intendin' to go to war on behalf of the Dark Gods'.

missions_localised_description_wh2_dlc11_mis_cst_engage_force_army_skv	A horde of dirty, stinkin' ratmen 'ave been seen up 'ere on the surface, where they 'ave no right to be. I think we need to get raisin' and bindin' an' then deal with these pests, without delay!	false
missions_localised_description_wh2_dlc11_mis_cst_engage_force_army_tmb	Never takin' no for an answer, the Tomb Kings 'ave raised an army an' surely plan to attack us. Under the circumstances, I think it would be best that we meet 'em in battle an' crush 'em before they've even begun to march!	false

missions_localised_description_wh2_dlc11_mis_cst_engage_force_army_wef	Part of the trouble wiv Wood Elves - 'cos there's several ways they can get on yer nerves - is that you never know where yer truly are with 'em. You can't trust 'em and you can't live with 'em, so the only remainin' option is to kill as many of 'em as you can - preferably all of 'em at once. Let's go!	false
missions_localised_description_wh2_dlc11_mis_cst_make_alliance_0	Now, I know it may not sound particularly piratey to you, but a pact between us *is* required. An alliance will guarantee that our plundering days continue for quite some time yet.	false
missions_localised_description_wh2_dlc11_mis_cst_raid_region_brt	The people of this realm are overburdened with luxuries, the poor beggars! I say we aid these unfortunate mortals an' lighten their loads somewhat. What do yer reckon? Let's raid their roads to free them of their 'eavy burden.	false
missions_localised_description_wh2_dlc11_mis_cst_raid_region_cst	Those swindlin' scallywags - those honourless pirates - 'ave stolen the riches of the land and the poor folk that live there!

Let's raid, pillage, and plunder, until we've reclaimed every last stolen penny!	false
missions_localised_description_wh2_dlc11_mis_cst_raid_region_def	The Dark Elves will never achieve their goal to return to Ulthuan if they continue to be distracted by such unnecessary trifles!

missions_localised_description_wh2_dlc11_mis_cst_raid_region_emp	Apparently, the Empire’s trade routes are - and I quote - "fraught with dangers". I say the mortals who take these roads are asking for trouble! Let's raid these 'em an' punish the merchants who travel them for their truly terrible 'ubris - a terrible thing in any being.	false
missions_localised_description_wh2_dlc11_mis_cst_raid_region_grn	Stromfels an' Manann - gods, I hate the Greenskins, wiv their… green skins an' nasty breath. Some of 'em 'ave the beginnings of an understanding of the value of treasure, but most are more interested in pullin' teeth outta the dead. I call that "poor asset management", and it's not on - let's raid their stashes and punish these gits!	false
missions_localised_description_wh2_dlc11_mis_cst_raid_region_hef	Renowned for their craftsmanship an' the beautiful trinkets they make, the High Elves certainly 'ave abilities.

missions_localised_description_wh2_dlc11_mis_cst_raid_region_lzd	Those Lizardmen - an' you've gotta admire they're persistence on this matter - are still pitifully clingin' on to the words of a dead race lost to time. We need to relieve 'em of this burden - take those statues they still obsess over an' teach 'em a lesson!	false
missions_localised_description_wh2_dlc11_mis_cst_raid_region_nor	Norscans are far too uncivilised to understand the true value of the treasure they hoard - clearly, only we appreciate its real worth.

missions_localised_description_wh2_dlc11_mis_cst_raid_region_skv	The ratmen have no interest in the beauty of gold and treasure, as they only trade in Warptokens an' backstabbin'. They steal the world's wealth to deny superior races their glory, which is more than a bit of a liberty. Let's take back these riches shall we?	false
missions_localised_description_wh2_dlc11_mis_cst_raid_region_tmb	The Nehekarans once understood the value of gold an' built great big monuments to celebrate their wealth. Now, the Tomb Kings just obsess over little jars an' forget 'emselves. If they don't want 'em, we should take their riches away - think of it as de-clutterin' like...	false
missions_localised_description_wh2_dlc11_mis_cst_raid_region_vmp	Forever plotting an' schemin' - far more than us - the lords of this 'ere land won’t even notice if we lift a few treasures from under their… well, where their noses used to be anyways. Shall we raid this region while they are distracted? Would make sound commercial sense in my opinion.	false
missions_localised_description_wh2_dlc11_mis_cst_raid_region_wef	I freely admit that I don't understand Wood Elves. The Asrai’s lands are filled with riches, but they spurn 'em and 'ang about in the trees for centuries. It don't make sense, does it?

It seems that not a day goes by without the news of some horrible tropical disease striking some poor settler down. The most innocuous cut or scratch sustained here can become horribly infected within hours, making every trek into the jungle a highly risky endeavour indeed.\\n\\nPerhaps by fate, word has reached me of a mysterious individual who shadows the Empire’s troops in the deep jungle, patching up the wounds of the gravely injured left behind following skirmishes with the lizards. Men thought to be well within Morr’s deathly embrace have been mysteriously brought back from the brink by someone who clearly has advanced medical training, with even the most horrendous injuries cleaned, disinfected, and stitched as if by the hands of the most highly-trained physician in all of the Empire. Our very own injured relate to me their encounters with this healer, not remembering much other than glimpses of a necklace of fangs – trophies perhaps?\\n\\nI have been in few environments more treacherous to man than Lustria; it goes without saying that for us to endure here, we should somehow reach out to this ‘medic’ and persuade them to join our cause.	false
missions_localised_description_wh2_dlc13_wulfhart_hertwig_van_hal_stage_2	Hertwig van Hal is an intriguing individual. He bears the surname of a well-known ancient lineage of Witch Hunters, but for reasons unknown to me he seems rather ashamed of it. When I brought it up he responded angrily, claiming his vocation as a Witch Hunter was not of his choosing. He then quickly changed the subject, revealing that he was a master physician of Altdorf and insisted I address him as ‘Herr Doctor’. It truly beguiles me why a physician from Altdorf is carrying out Witch Hunter duties in Lustria, but I am not one to poke about in another man’s private affairs.\\n\\nThere is certainly much more to Herr Doctor which perhaps in time he will reveal on his own volition, but right now he has temporarily left camp. Before leaving, he told me he intends to track down some information about one particular Vampire he has been searching for called Alistair the Red. He has given me assurances that I cannot help him with this particular task and that he will return soon.	false
missions_localised_description_wh2_dlc13_wulfhart_hertwig_van_hal_stage_3	In getting to know Herr Doctor better, I’ve discovered that he is a most conflicted man. He is ruthlessly obsessed with destroying Vampires, but is also a skilful healer with astounding convalescent skills. I felt I had built up enough of a rapport to bring up the subject of his famous lineage once again.\\n\\nWith a deep sigh, Hertwig explained his intense hate for the van Hal name, for his ambition was always to preserve life and not to chase destruction. For him, the van Hals would never be innocent of their progenitor’s sins and he wanted nothing to do with them. "A man can try to avoid his destiny as much as he wants," he added, "but in the end it will always find him." He would elaborate no further. \\n\\nThe next day, he invoked me to continue helping him with his mission to track down Alistair the Red. He says the best way to draw attention from a Vampire Pirate is to raid their lands and waters, so that is what we will do. It is certainly not without a touch of irony that we are probably about to steal from pirates.	false
missions_localised_description_wh2_dlc13_wulfhart_hertwig_van_hal_stage_4	Herr Doctor continues to be driven by a strong desire to destroy this creature of the night he refers to as Alistair the Red. Having observed Hertwig slay dozens of Vampires up to now, it is clear he gains no pleasure from it, but at the same time carries out Witch Hunter duties with the aptitude of one who was born to do so – like a true van Hal. Though my curiosity threatens to overcome me, I have resisted asking further questions about the history of this man I have befriended. It seems there is no time for it anyway, as Herr Doctor now wants us to mobilise against The Awakening, and immediately.\\n\\nThose who know anything about the area say the place is a husk of an old colony that was settled many years ago, but was left haunted, derelict, and overrun by the Undead. There is a lot of unknown history there, but Hertwig is convinced its winding streets and deep catacombs harbour the creature that he seeks to destroy.  A direct assault on this place seems dangerous, but I am a man of my word and Herr Doctor assures us he is very close to achieving his goal.	false
missions_localised_description_wh2_dlc13_wulfhart_hertwig_van_hal_stage_5a	In the time I’ve spent helping van Hal I have gotten to know him well, learning that his story is one of great tragedy not unlike my own.\\n\\nIn his early days Hertwig was a physician of Altdorf and distanced himself from the van Hal name, hating its connotations. He cared little for the affairs of Witch Hunters, dedicating his life only to the practise of medicine and his beloved fiancé Matilda. One evening, a red-haired corpse was brought to his surgery with a stake mysteriously plunged through its heart. The young, naïve doctor removed the stake during the examination and later that night found the creature with its fangs buried in Matilda's neck. He desperately fought the vile monster off before it fled, but it was too late. To prevent Matilda from rising from the dead, he had no choice but to stab her through the heart and remove her head. Beset by anguish and grief, van Hal felt he had no choice but to dedicate himself to the destruction of creatures of the night.\\n\\nWith the red-haired Vampire that killed his beloved now slain, he is grateful for my help and guidance and will serve the expedition indefinitely.	false

missions_localised_description_wh2_dlc13_wulfhart_jorek_grimm_stage_1	The colonists have long known about Lizardmen mining convoys that regularly travel along established trails in the deep jungle like clockwork. They transport some sort of glossy black raw material that resembles obsidian, the dense metal that the Wizards of home know all too well for its anti-magic properties. There was some concern when these convoy movements inexplicably stopped, perhaps now taking different routes if not ceasing altogether. I was unconcerned, but apparently the lizards don’t change their ways without very good reason. To appease the colonists, I sent out an expedition to investigate the old trails and they soon returned with a captive – a Skink, one of the convoy overseers.\\n\\nWhen our Saurian translator asked the skittish creature about the black material, it held its forked tongue. Further ‘prodding’ with my hunting knife made the creature reveal something about a "short, bearded warmblood" that had been repeatedly stealing from their convoys, forcing them to change their routes.\\n\\nWhat is a Dwarf doing this far from the Spine of Sotek mountains? This Dawi is either incredibly brave or incredibly stupid to be harassing the Lizardmen on their own turf, but is getting away with it somehow. Credit where credit’s due…	false
missions_localised_description_wh2_dlc13_wulfhart_jorek_grimm_stage_2	It is truly astonishing how this Dawi Engineer has been able to survive out in the wild on his solo forays against the Lizardmen's convoys, but it is clearly down to his own ingenuity. A keen and talented inventor, Jorek seems to have all sorts of survivalist equipment at his disposal, all designed and built himself. He is very secretive about his past, revealing little more than the location of his previous home back in the Old World, the great Dwarf port of Barak Varr.\\n\\nIt seems that something in Jorek’s earlier life clearly irks him, which really isn’t all that surprising – Dwarfs feel all wrongdoings committed against them as if they had only just happened. With wild eyes he tells me that he is destined for great things, but must "rebuild his reputation, one invention at a time". Though he appears sceptical that we can really help him, he sees value in the protection the expedition can provide on his travels through Lustria. He has also suggested we gather some resources for some new inventions he thinks may prove useful to him and the expedition.	false
missions_localised_description_wh2_dlc13_wulfhart_jorek_grimm_stage_3	I am amazed by this Dwarf’s ambition and enthusiasm for invention. He seems to find a use for any kind of material he can find and gets excited about all the unique resources we come across. This obsession with metallurgy and mineralogy has made it clearer to me why he is here – the Lustrian jungle is one of the most unexplored places in the known world, offering many mysterious raw materials with strange and amazing properties to a tinkerer like Jorek.\\n\\nGradually, the Master Engineer has also become more open about his past. Given his chosen surroundings, I was surprised to discover that he was once a great shipbuilder but had been shunned and ousted by the Engineers' Guild back in Barak Varr. According to him, his contemporaries considered him a threat because of his intellectual brilliance, although I have a feeling there are elements to this story he has not revealed. It is perhaps unwise to probe any further; I can never hope to understand the confusing, stubborn, grudge-holding ways of the Dawi anyway. As long as Jorek continues to help the expedition, we will continue to supply him with the materials he needs.	false
missions_localised_description_wh2_dlc13_wulfhart_jorek_grimm_stage_4	Jorek has revealed to me that he has been working on something big. He described it as a "masterpiece of gyro-powered flight", a flying machine he claims will be better than any Gyrocopter built by his kin anywhere in the world. All he needs to complete its assembly is a chunk of a rare metal called 'obsinite', a form of Lustrian obsidian used by the Lizardmen that is harder and more durable than steel. With the Lizardmen's mining convoys having now changed their routes to avoid Jorek’s thieving attentions, we’ll have to find a different source of the metal. He tells me he has a hidden stockpile collected from his previous smash-'n'-grab attacks, located on the Volcanic Islands off the east coast of Lustria. Alternatively, he also knows of a consignment of obsinite heading north towards the Ancient City of Quintex.\\n\\nBy the sounds of it, the flying machine Jorek intends to build would be a very welcome addition to the expedition's armoury. This may very well be worth the effort!	false
missions_localised_description_wh2_dlc13_wulfhart_jorek_grimm_stage_5	In return for helping him obtain all the raw materials he has desired thus far, Jorek has accepted a permanent position with my expedition. This is most fortunate, for he has proven himself a valuable member of the hunting party, whose unique skills make him integral to our mission. More than that, Jorek has become a loyal friend. One day, as we enjoyed a barrel of Bugman’s together, he revealed to me the rest of his sorry story.\\n\\nOnce a member of the Cragbrow Clan of Barak Varr, Jorek was commissioned to design new steamships for his throng, but utilised methods of engineering that eschewed Dwarf traditions. He knew there was great potential in his designs regardless of the techniques used to develop them, but could never see them through to completion due to sabotage by his jealous, ultra-traditionalist peers. In the end, Jorek was ousted from the Engineers' Guild and left for good. Truly, the Dwarfs are a strange lot!\\n\\nNow with the freedom and raw materials to develop any invention he chooses, I have never seen a happier Dwarf in all my life. I have little doubt that in time the potential brainchildren of this brilliant inventor will help turn the tide of our struggle here in Lustria.	false
missions_localised_description_wh2_dlc13_wulfhart_kalara_stage_1	The colonists speak of something strange living in the nearby jungles. They say it is not of the lizards, nor of the ratmen that infest this continent, but something else; a "ghost" they call it. Part of me thinks this gods-forsaken place drives some men to hallucinations, but today a hunting party returned with a curious tale. They had been tracking a wild Bastiladon whose carcass would have provided much sustenance for the colonists, and had trapped the great beast in a bog. They claim that as they moved in for the kill, it was unexpectedly struck down by an arrow propelled through the thick jungle canopy directly into one of its eyes.\\n\\nSuch frightening huntsmanship could only be supernatural. In this flora-covered terrain, it is almost impossible to hit a moving Bastiladon’s weak points from range as the men described. Furthermore, they claim they were then threatened by a mysterious, hooded figure in the trees above them, a sorrowful voice of a woman telling them "whosoever approaches my bounty will share its fate".\\n\\nPerhaps this is the "ghost" the colonists speak of? Whatever it is, to kill a Bastiladon in such a way requires a level of precision far exceeding that of any huntsman I’ve ever met.	false
missions_localised_description_wh2_dlc13_wulfhart_kalara_stage_2	I have met a few of the elusive fey folk of Athel Loren, and in my early dealings with Kalara it certainly appears she is typical of her kind. On the rare occasions in the past when my hunting expeditions unwittingly led me into the Wood Elves’ realm, I found them to be standoffish and determinedly detached from the outside world – almost aggressively so. Those familiar with the Asrai know better than to trespass upon their hunting grounds, for they are considered to be some of the most lethal hunters in the known world. We are extremely fortunate to have brought a Waystalker into our ranks, regardless of how aloof she may be.\\n\\nKalara told me that she has been in Lustria for quite some time. The beast she seeks does not prowl these lands alone though and bringing it down will take some fight, which is why she requested our assistance. For a Waystalker to admit that a quarry is beyond her talent confirms what an incredibly dangerous monster it must be. I gave her assurances that I would see this hunt through, but for now we await more information regarding the beast’s whereabouts.	false
missions_localised_description_wh2_dlc13_wulfhart_kalara_stage_3	Kalara has been part of the expedition for quite some time now. She seems restless to slay this beast, but knows little about its actual nature. I find it curious as to why she seeks a quarry which is largely a mystery to her… but in truth I am simply glad to have her strength added to our own, so see no need to push the question. We are mobilising now anyway, as news has reached camp that a treasure-seeking convoy of about fifty-or-so men disappeared into some nearby ruins. Kalara insisted she investigate and came back describing a grisly scene. Little was left of the mutilated men, she said, and she is convinced it is connected to the beast we are hunting.\\n\\nThough I respect Kalara greatly, I feel she has not been entirely forthcoming with us. She might not be lying about what she has seen this time, but I do believe she is withholding something about the motives for her Lustrian hunt. For this reason, I’ve decided to take the expedition and investigate this ruin myself.	false
missions_localised_description_wh2_dlc13_wulfhart_kalara_stage_4	I started having reservations about the true nature of the beast Kalara is pursuing, and even considered calling off this hunt – but then she revealed something quite astounding.\\n\\nIt is her sincere belief that the beast she hunts contains the reincarnated soul of her dead lover. She explained that as punishment from the one called Kurnous, the Elven God of the Hunt, Kalara’s beloved is in an endless cycle of life and death, always coming back as a murderous beast after it is slain. She has killed several versions of the beast before, and is determined to end the cycle once and for all, so her love may finally pass into the afterlife. She believes almost obsessively that Kurnous is testing her, for she always finds that the lost soul of her lover passes into a more unkillable beast than the one before it.\\n\\nTruly, the Elven gods are stranger than those of men. Out of empathy for Kalara’s loss, I have decided to continue helping her for now. We must cast our net out wide and interrogate the Dark Ones to the north as well as the lizards to the south to see what they know of this beast.	false
missions_localised_description_wh2_dlc13_wulfhart_kalara_stage_5	I confronted Kalara last night, hunter to hunter, urging her to give up this futile mission. To my surprise, she agreed, but implored me to help her with one final task. I accepted on the sole condition she tell me everything.\\n\\nKalara revealed she was once a princess of Wydrioth, a High Realm of Athel Loren. Her lover Atherin was a Wild Rider of Kurnous, the personal guard of Athel Loren’s king. Atherin violated his oath to sever all worldly ties, persisting in his relationship with Kalara and even revealing his order’s hallowed secrets to her. Kurnous vengefully transformed Atherin into a mighty stag before cruelly leading Kalara to unwittingly hunt it down. Discovering the stag’s true nature, Kalara eventually learned of Atherin’s cursed fate of eternal reincarnation as a beast.\\n\\nShe had also recently been visited in her dreams by the goddess Isha, mother of the Elven race and consort to Kurnous himself. A great privilege, she said, for Isha is usually forbidden to have any contact with her worldly children. The goddess offered Kalara another route to freeing her lover's soul – instead of further destruction, she must make a worldly display of love and construct a shrine directly on the banks of Itza’s fabled Emerald Pools.	false
missions_localised_description_wh2_dlc13_wulfhart_rodrik_languille_stage_1	It caught my attention recently to hear of a swordsman who had become army-less after miraculously escaping a slaughter at the hands of the lizard-beasts. A possible recruit? If my memory serves me correctly, he had arrived months earlier on a galleon that was flying a flag of a Bretonnian dukedom unknown to me, though I know little of the Land of Chivalry. He had disembarked with a group of men who looked vaguely Knightly in appearance, but it was unclear whether they were individuals of any important political status. Their retinue was quite poorly equipped, as were they themselves. After buying what additional weapons and supplies they could from the colonists, they foolhardily headed straight into the jungle.\\n\\nWhether out of prudence of curiosity, I had them followed and watched. Unsurprisingly, word eventually returned that the Bretonnians were ill-prepared for their foray, losing half their retinue to disease and attacks before stumbling into the mists surrounding the ancient temple-city of Xlanhuapec. Thinking it was uninhabited, they attempted to plunder the city but instead suffered a catastrophic slaughter at the hands of the Lizardmen in a painfully predictable ambush.\\n\\nThe one survivor – this swordsman – had somehow fought himself out of the trap and was still out there.	false
missions_localised_description_wh2_dlc13_wulfhart_rodrik_languille_stage_2	The Bretonnian noble Rodrik L’Anguille appears to be a man of great physical strength and fortitude. He must be, for he has witnessed many terrible things while on his doomed journey. He has told me stories of men being swallowed up by monstrous things lurking in the waist-deep bogs they waded through on the trek, only to be spat out again in a spray of bloody gore. And then of the slaughter at Xlanhuapec itself; how he and his men observed the temple-city to be totally uninhabited as they entered, getting all the way into the central plaza before being set upon by a swarm of twelve foot tall reptilian monsters with daggers for teeth. Though he had fought out of his skin to survive and escape, in reality many of his men had fell trying to protect him.\\n\\nRodrik clearly yearns for vengeance, but there is also a downtroddenness to his character which I think goes far deeper than just the recent loss of his men. Maybe it is the reason why he came here in the first place, which he hasn’t really talked about? Right now, Xlanhuapec is in range for a potentially successful assault which needs to be capitalised upon without delay.	false
missions_localised_description_wh2_dlc13_wulfhart_rodrik_languille_stage_3	After avenging the death of his men at Xlanhuapec, I have realised more and more that Rodrik still bears within him a great resentment of something deeper. The only thing he has revealed thus far is that there are those back home in his dukedom of Anguille who would sooner see him dead than allow him to return. However, I have developed too much respect for the man just to ask about what sounds like a complicated past. After all, many an ill-advised adventurer has come to seek riches in this place for one reason or another, most of whom underestimate how terrifying a place Lustria really is.\\n\\n The galleons that steadily trickle into the New World colonies constantly bring greedy fools from the Old World, who have unwisely braved the perilous crossing of the Great Ocean just for an opportunity to plunder cities they are not sure even exist. Of course, they all become lizard-feed in the end – but not Rodrik. He may very well be one of these greedy fools, but to have faced the Lizardmen and survived marks him out as a warrior we could really do with having around regardless of his past indiscretions.	false
missions_localised_description_wh2_dlc13_wulfhart_rodrik_languille_stage_4	To help our friend Rodrik I have ordered the expedition to march towards Pox Marsh. There, he claims, we will intercept the assassins who wish him dead before they even know what hit them. One evening, as we pitched camp for the night along the route, Rodrik pulled me away from the campfire for a private word. With a deep sadness to his tone, he revealed that Lord Tudual – the unsavoury individual who had ordered his death – is actually the duke of Anguille, Rodrik’s homeland. But even more shocking is the fact that this Duke Tudual is actually Rodrik’s father. So Rodrik is a prince of Anguille! He went on to explain that he is an 'unfavoured' heir, seen as a threat to Duke Tudual’s desired successor, Rodrik’s younger brother.\\n\\nThe reason why Rodrik came here with only a ragtag force in the first place has now become clear – Duke Tudual had sent his son to Lustria under the guise of wanting him to prove himself, but in reality was counting on him perishing. It seems the duke underestimated both Rodrik's skill as swordsman and his will to live. I have reassured Rodrik that he has nothing to fear and together we shall vanquish these would-be assassins.	false
missions_localised_description_wh2_dlc13_wulfhart_rodrik_languille_stage_5	What a sorry state of affairs this truly is for Prince Rodrik. We dealt with Duke Tudual’s assassins without issue, but only time will tell if this will be the last attempt to prevent his son from returning to Anguille. Rodrik himself seems uninterested in returning anyway – he tells me he has no intention of claiming power in a land he now feels no attachment to, for the jungle has become his home.\\n\\nThe last piece of Rodrik story – the reason why his father wants him dead – had eluded me until recently, simply because Rodrik had kept it secret. Now I know why, for it is a source of great shame for him. Though Rodrik was his father’s eldest son, his mother was a commoner who was Duke Tudual’s peasant concubine. Fearing he would have no other sons, the duke recognised and brought Rodrik into his household from birth, but when Rodrik’s younger brother was unexpectedly born of the duke’s lawful wife, Rodrik was foresaken.\\n\\nPrince Rodrik remains the rightful heir to the dukedom of Anguille, and as long as he lives it is feasible that Duke Tudual will attempt to remove him by sending assassins once again. As always, we must stay vigilant on his behalf.	false

This was the strength which Snikch’s master craved.\\n\\nThe location of the great power was finally revealed to Snikch through the words of the Chaos warhost’s Sorcerer, who had vainly attempted to bargain for his own release. “You are a fool, ratling peon,” the Sorcerer shrieked, “for the power you seek is a Daemon of Slaanesh, and no minor Daemon at that! Tz’arkan, the Drinker of Worlds, is a ravenous monster inextricably bound to the soul of a living entity. The only chance of severing the Chaos-imbued bond is to destroy the vessel in which the Daemon is trapped. That vessel is none other than the Druchii known as Malus Darkblade.”\\n\\nThe prospect of wielding the power of a Daemon suddenly sounded very good to the Deathmaster.

missions_localised_description_wh2_dlc15_grn_grom_black_toof_1	Grom had been guilty of resting on his laurels in the past, especially when the spoils of war (and the ensuing victory banquets) were particularly good. If it had not been for the sinister encouragement of his power-crazed Shaman Ol’ Blacktoof, Grom’s ambitions may not have always been backed up by his actions, and he certainly wouldn't have gotten off his corpulent rump to lead Broken Axe’s first invasion of Yvresse. Unfortunately, Blacktoof eventually had his head lopped off by that pointy-‘eaded git Eltharion, but before that had absorbed copious amounts of power from destroyed Waystones. So much power, in fact, that it made him rather difficult to actually be killed, even after having his head severed from his body.\\n\\nBefore Grom had given up on rallying his fleeing troops from Tor Yvresse, he’d spotted his Shaman’s head on the ground shrieking angry obscenities at him, so he put it in a jar before fleeing himself. Since that day, Blacktoof’s head mostly spurted unintelligible nonsense – being devoid of a body can do that to an Orc. Recently, however, he started saying things that grabbed Grom’s attention, claiming that he knew how to get the Waaagh! going again. The first thing he suggested Grom do, however, is throw a feast to motivate the ladz.\\n\\nNever turning down an excuse for a banquet, Grom bellows to them to grab some scrap to get the cauldron fire going, and now!	false
missions_localised_description_wh2_dlc15_grn_grom_black_toof_2	Grom’s minions collected enough scrap to set Misty Mountain on fire. As the cauldron bubbled away, Niblet, eager to get the banquet started, scurried off to return with a hefty amount of a rather strange foodstuff of unfathomable origin, although Blacktoof’s head assured everyone that it was actually edible.	false
missions_localised_description_wh2_dlc15_grn_grom_black_toof_3	As Grom and the tribe stuffed their faces around the banquet fire, Blacktoof’s head started blabbering once again, excitably exclaiming his great plan to get the horde together and go back to Tor Yvresse. It was obvious that the bitter Shaman was after some long overdue revenge on the Warden himself, the glint of the Elven general’s sword being the last thing the Shaman saw before his untimely decapitation. Grom was too distracted to think about the crazy Shaman’s personal vendetta, since he had his own motivations to return to the pointy-'eads' glittering city. He'd long dreamt of sailing back there to have another good scrap, but this time claiming the metropolis as his greatest prize – and of course, holding the banquet to end all banquets in his own triumphant honour!\\n\\nBefore Grom could shove a bit more of the cooked carrion into his massive gob, Blacktoof’s head drew his attention to a Food Merchant who had shown up nearby in the lumbering form of a Troll Hag. Grom couldn’t immediately figure out how, but the Shaman suggested that perhaps the Troll Hag could help them. In any event, Grom was always enticed by the possibility of sinking his teeth into any new, exotic things the Food Merchant might sell him.	false
missions_localised_description_wh2_dlc15_grn_grom_black_toof_3_2	The Food Merchant was not particularly aggressive towards Grom and the ladz, though they still regarded her as being rather odd, even by Greenskins standards. What annoyed Grom the most was the fact that she really didn’t have as much food to sell him as he wanted. Sharing his frustrations for some mysterious reason, Blacktoof’s head assured him he could still get his hands on more food ingredients to fill his increasingly distended belly, and that it would help the tribe’s ruinous cause. As usual, Grom didn’t understand the Shaman’s motives or ends, but wasn’t going to disagree with his advice, especially when it would result in even more grub entering his huge gob.	false
missions_localised_description_wh2_dlc15_grn_grom_black_toof_4	Grom was getting restless. Back when Blacktoof was still in one piece he had helped Broken Axe to countless victories, but now all he seemed to want Grom to do was eat. The obese Goblin King wouldn’t usually have a problem with that, except a day spent eating was no different to any other day, and he failed to see how it would get him to the gates of Tor Yvresse.\\n\\nNiblet showed up to tell him that the Shaman’s head was doing some strange things, spinning around in its jar with its eyes glazed over. Blacktoof was in one of his trances, an event which usually led to a prophecy. When the head finally stopped spinning, it gazed upon Grom with its familiar, evil glare. The Shaman said that although making the crossing would be much easier this time, getting across Ulthuan's soil and into the city would not be. He had seen that the pointy-‘ead Warden had used every method possible to reinforce his realm’s defences, the walls of the city built thicker, the blanketing mists more lethal than ever. Luckily for them, by channeling the power he'd sapped from the ruined Waystones, Blacktoof had worked out the precise limitations of the mists’ power. Every time Grom feasted, his waistline, strength, and battle prowess would grow, eventually reaching a point when he would be able to penetrate the murk.\\n\\nTo get to the gates of Tor Yvresse, then, Grom needs only to keep eating as many different dishes as he can!	false
missions_localised_description_wh2_dlc15_grn_grom_black_toof_5_ME	With the Broken Axe tribe marching in his wake, Grom had eaten his way across the world to become fatter and stronger than he’d ever been.

Grom was ready to lead the tribe through the inimical mists to the gates of the prized city of Tor Yvresse, expecting Eltharion to be there to give him the fight to end all fights.

Though Oreon himself has not been seen or heard of in many centuries, his band and their descendants are known to still reside far away on the desert continent as mercenaries-for-hire. Such an existence is frowned upon, and for some time there has been whispers throughout the glades demanding these skillful Elven warriors return to fulfil their obligations to the forest.

As with all Tree Spirits, her loyalty is to the forest first and foremost, but she is also closely associated with Coeddil, the malevolent Ancient guilty of committing heinous crimes against the Asrai.

The Empire states of Nordland and Middenland have historically both claimed Laurelorn Forest as their territory, but due to the fiercely isolationist Asrai who inhabit it, none have ever tried to enforce such claims. Lately the Empire has been the least of the Laurelorn Elves’ worries, as the Sea of Claws has seen increasingly frequent crossings by bloodthirsty Norscans whose sole purpose is war and destruction. Recent Northmen raids have seen them gain ground further south into Nordland, bringing Marauder bands closer to Laurelorn Forest. Minor skirmishes have already occurred, with Asrai blood needlessly spilt. For the good of the Weave, defeating the Norscans in battle and weakening their numbers may facilitate a friendship with the Laurelorn Elves and make them more sympathetic to your cause.	false
missions_localised_description_wh2_dlc16_wef_confederation_mission_sisters	The Worldroots are important to all, for the fate of the Oak of Ages that sprouted them governs the fate of all forests, and some say the fate of the entire world. Few are more aware of this than the Sisters of Twilight, who use the ancient pathways by the will of their beloved Mage Queen Ariel. Lately it has been reported that the activities of the scheming, skittering Skaven have caused damage to the Worldroots. The ratmen gnaw at them not only making them untraversable in places, but also rendering all who use them vulnerable to Skaven ambushes. Bringing the Skaven to war and defeating them in battle will send a message that the defilement of the Oak of Ages’ sacred roots will not be tolerated. Furthermore, such actions will be seen favourably by the Sisters of Twilight, whose battle prowess and association with the powerful Mage Queen would make them very useful allies indeed.	false
missions_localised_description_wh2_dlc16_wef_confederation_mission_talsyn	Ariel and Isha have long been one and the same, their desires merged into a single whole. Orion’s personality, however, is a melding not only of Kurnous, but also of the last Elf whose flesh was chosen to bear Kurnous’ spirit. The one selected by the Wild Riders on the eve of the last vernal equinox was a particularly combative individual, whose love for warmongering in the forest’s defence was said to exceed that of any his peers. With that in mind, it will take little more than some displays of martial prowess to garner the approval of the current manifestation of the King in the Woods, who could become a most valuable ally.	false
missions_localised_description_wh2_dlc16_wef_confederation_mission_torgovann	The history between men and the folk of Athel Loren has always been a tumultuous one. Though the affairs of the earlier primitive man-tribes had been seen as folly by the Asrai, in more recent times the kingdom of Bretonnia to the west has grown in importance, acting as a buffer against the many threats the forest has had to face. Sometimes the ignorant men who live at the forest’s fringes take unpermitted sustenance from it, with such transgressions always met with the rage of a Wild Hunt that brings swift and merciless death. Lord Daith, ruler of Torgovann, has recently been vocal about the fact that the balance of power between Bretonnia and Athel Loren must be reinforced, for although these men can be considered friends, they are also inferiors and need to be reminded of that fact. A display of force against them will certainly show Lord Daith that you do not shirk from such responsibilities.	false
missions_localised_description_wh2_dlc16_wef_confederation_mission_wydrioth	The Pine Crags is an embattled region, ever beset by the Greenskins of the Grey Mountains. As such, beneath Wydrioth’s eaves are a maze of walkways, root-braced tunnels, and outposts of living defence-works that have repelled many an opportunistic Waaagh!. Lord Findol who holds sway over the realm has a thirst for battle matched only by his courtiers, taking great joy in slaughtering the green menace who so frequently intrude upon his domain. After seeing off a recent rash of particularly large Greenskins attacks, however, the realm is slightly less defensible than it has been in the past. Lord Findol has reached out to you asking for your assistance – he would like you to bring war to the Greenskins so that their attentions may be elsewhere while Wydrioth’s defences are rejuvenated. Though he has little fear that any Greenskins attack would succeed even now, he prefers for his glades to be fully primed to inflict maximum bloodshed for the inevitable future attacks. 	false

For reasons forgotten in time, some of Athel Loren’s most ancient denizens left the great forest long ago to journey to the previously unexplored extremes of the life-giving Worldroots. Beyond the distant mountains to the east, in the lush jungles of southern Cathay, these spirits made their unlikely home.

missions_localised_description_wh3_dlc24_ie_qb_cth_miao_ying_storm_wind_coronal	Once a gift from the Dragon Emperor, the Storm Wind Coronal has since been lost with the fall of the Snake Gate, lying cruelly just out of reach. With the Great Bastion compromised, all of Grand Cathay stands vulnerable; only once the Snake Gate has been reclaimed can the strength of the Celestial Empire be restored. Through conquest and occupation, the enchanted Coronal may finally be returned to its rightful owner, ready to take its place upon the Storm Dragon's brow once more.	false
missions_localised_description_wh3_dlc24_ie_qb_cth_yuan_bo_dragons_fang	In recent months, crop failures, illnesses and pestilential plagues have befallen the farmlands of Grand Cathay. Whilst seemingly isolated instances to the casual observer, Yuan Bo discerns deeper than most. The machinations of the Ruinous Powers are at play within the realm, seeking to undermine and destabilise the smooth running of the provinces. At the Jade Dragon’s word, his agents have closely investigated each suspect instance, and after a time, found profane markings, runes and glyphs at the sites of all of these disasters. If left unchecked, these will merely be the start of an epidemic that ravages the rural heart of Grand Cathay.	false
missions_localised_description_wh3_dlc24_ie_qb_cth_zhao_ming_horns_of_shang_yang	Bearing magic attuned to the Iron Winds, the Horns of Shang-Yang are as powerful as they are rare. When the city of their namesake was wrested from its rightful ruler, the Horns too were lost. Such power cannot be allowed to reside in the wrong hands and nor can the proud city of Shang-Yang be allowed to crumble under the mismanagement of unworthy occupiers. It is time to retake the city; those sitting within its walls will soon learn that the Iron Dragon's vengeance is a force to be truly feared.	false
missions_localised_description_wh3_dlc24_ie_qb_ksl_mother_ostankya_crown_of_claws	Mother Ostankya’s eyes glaze over as she is suddenly overcome by a torrent of whispers from the spirits of the land. In hallucination, she scries a cave somewhere in the distant mountains where deep within sits a cavern of rare ice crystals, a place thrumming with the ancient magic of the land concentrated in dozens of glimmering stalagmites and stalactites. A single shard of one of these formations could be a powerful centrepiece for Ostankya’s crown, augmenting her influence over the spirits who facilitate her frightening spells. Yet as she drifts out of her vision, she also makes out a cacophony of monstrous roars, shrieks and howls... Something feral awaits!	false
missions_localised_description_wh3_dlc24_ie_qb_tze_the_changeling_the_tricksters_staff	The Changeling always has his multitudinous fingers in many pies, and one scheme put into motion many days prior is now coming to delightful fruition. The Trickster’s Staff, an ancient Tzeentchian artefact of little importance to the Old Worlders other than being worth a great deal of gold, sits securely in the vault of Dwarf merchants at Karak Azgaraz. By the Changeling’s machinations it had previously been in the possession of Empire merchants, only for him to promptly steal it back from them and plant it into the Dwarfs’ possession. With his deceitful whispers, the Empire merchants have been led to believe that the Dwarfs stole ‘their’ priceless artefact, and they now prepare to march on Azgaraz where bloodshed will surely ensue. The Changeling, of course, will take his customary front-row seat…	false
missions_localised_description_wh3_dlc24_ksl_mother_ostankya_hex_bewitching_allure	Fyodora Ungol and her sisters have reached out with a twisted tale, sharing stories of a dangerously powerful witch and a Hex capable of bewitching weak mortal minds. They are willing to share the location of this mysterious Hex-wielder, yet their feigned fear and enthusiastic help is undoubtedly suspicious. It would seem an ambush may lie in wait, yet this may be one trap worth walking into willingly. If these sisters possess the Hex they described, then its knowledge must be snatched from their skulls, through a gaping head wound if necessary!	false
missions_localised_description_wh3_dlc24_ksl_mother_ostankya_hex_covens_cursemark	Something burrows deep beneath the earth, reeking of sinister corruption – an Underway perhaps, infested with filthy vermin. Whatever the cause, its rot has withered the land, with every ounce of its power emanating from a single point of infection. Such power could be used in the creation of a new Hex – one that could entrap such vile trespassers before they ever have chance to plant their virulent seeds of corruption. Seek out the source of this cancerous blight – the essence of whatever lies at the heart of this scourge must be harvested!	false

With Dark Magic, gateways may be opened to each forest, providing an endless fount of spiritual energy.\\n\\nThe Wood Elves however, prove a constant thorn in the side. Seeing such things as a threat to the sanctity of their land, they defend the Magical Forests against all intruders, barring entry to any who would seek to channel their essence. Dealing with these misguided miscreants will prove a challenge, yet with the aid of the malevolent spirits of the forest, the ancient power of these woodlands may yet be within reach.	false
missions_localised_description_wh3_dlc24_ksl_mother_ostankya_hex_malediction_of_ruin	Never before has the world seen such a collection of Forbidden Hexes, each a powerful maelstrom of Dark Magic in their own right. Combined into the Malediction of Ruin, they have the power to potentially erase all wickedness befouling the land, bringing the forces of corruption to calamity. With a target chosen and the ritual set in motion, all manner of dark forces descend, seeking to interfere out of desperation to avoid their inevitable doom. Hold the forces of evil back; once the ritual is complete, the land shall be cleansed of their filth forevermore.	false

It is said that whenever war is waged righteously in the Celestial's eyes, the one known as the Heavenly Bowman leaps across the very mountains to aid those who display adeptness in marksmanship on the field of battle. Thus, those who fight skilfully for the greater good of Grand Cathay need not wait long to meet the greatest of her towering sentinels…	false

With his deceitful whispers, the Empire merchants have been led to believe that the Dwarfs stole ‘their’ priceless artefact, and they now prepare to march on Azgaraz where bloodshed will surely ensue.

missions_localised_description_wh3_dlc25_mis_dwf_malakai_dreadquake_destruction_1	A detestable Sorcerer-Prophet of the Chaos Dwarfs wreaks havoc across the land. Dreadquake war machines ensnare ever more captives destined for the factories of the Dark Lands. Your newly-assigned Gyrocopters could make short work of the loathsome contraptions, but the pilots are still fresh out of training and must be put through their paces with live combat. This will also serve as a field test for their new vessels, allowing the gathering of enough information to make some much needed upgrades.	false
missions_localised_description_wh3_dlc25_mis_dwf_malakai_dreadquake_destruction_2	To the puzzlement of your troops, the hunted Sorcerer-Prophet flits and raids elusively throughout the land as details on his main base of operations remain sparse. It appears a surgical operation, with smaller convoys reportedly replenishing his war supplies – or perhaps they are a ploy to distract pursuers from the main target’s grievous aims? One such resupply convoy has been spotted – decoy or not, if the twisted Dawi-Zharr wish to enslave innocents, each and every one of them shall pay the price.	false
missions_localised_description_wh3_dlc25_mis_dwf_malakai_dreadquake_destruction_3	The evil figure at the helm of the Dreadquake raiding party has come far in search of captives for his noxious mines and factories. The Chaos Dwarfs' home is a wasteland of smog and desolation, stifling the lungs of all but its wretched inhabitants. Only those with experience in similarly brutal climates might hope to match the strength of those that live there. Immerse yourself among the vile wastelands that plague the world, until the Dark Lands' toxic haze feels like a welcome reprieve.	false
missions_localised_description_wh3_dlc25_mis_dwf_malakai_dreadquake_destruction_4	Kislev will leave no stone unturned to avenge its losses from the Sorcerer-Prophet's raids – that much is certain – while the other great power in Old World always has its beady Imperial eyes cast everywhere. Establishing trade links with either Kislev or Cathay may prove beneficial for much more than fiscal reasons. Even from beyond your countless feats of engineering genius, the Dawi have much to offer, should either nation have any valuable information to exchange about recent events…	false
missions_localised_description_wh3_dlc25_mis_dwf_malakai_dreadquake_destruction_5	Your shared origins with the Chaos Dwarfs mean they are as cunning as you, the intellect of the hunted raider making him as dangerous as his own Dreadquakes. One pursuing force had recently been led through a chokepoint that soon became awash with their blood in a vicious ambush orchestrated by the Sorcerer-Prophet. The Dark Dwarfs’ ways of war are too much of a mystery to risk an immediate attack against a proven battlefield master such as this. His lesser brethren, on the other hand...	false
missions_localised_description_wh3_dlc25_mis_dwf_malakai_dreadquake_destruction_6	Gyrocopter squadrons have always been important to the Dawi throngs lucky enough to have them, providing invaluable air support for ground troops. Yet under your command they will not only fly in support of the warriors, but also to run aerial interference around the Spirit of Grungni as it flies to war. The Gyrocopters must be a day-to-day presence around the legendary Airship, allowing them opportunities to be routinely drilled as part of its battle protocols. 	false
missions_localised_description_wh3_dlc25_mis_dwf_malakai_dreadquake_destruction_narrative_battle	The Sorcerer-Prophet’s location and movements are finally being tracked from the air, leaving him nowhere to hide.

Many a Bloodthirster Daemon has found its way into the Book of Grudges, and a good Daemon-slaying is certainly long overdue. With enough calibration and field testing, your new batch of Organ Guns should make quick work of the fiend and, more importantly, show Gotrek that even a great Slayer such as he will never be able to match your kill-count!	false
missions_localised_description_wh3_dlc25_mis_dwf_malakai_exalted_bloodthirster_2	Ruin infuses the very air that surrounds the Khornate scourge recently appearing across the land; it is difficult to imagine that your Dwarf warriors will survive a Daemon encounter without experience fending off Chaos' malevolent energies. It may be worth seeking battle and adventure in a Wasteland steeped in Chaos – only then will your warriors understand its wretched taint, and feel prepared to fight through the darkness.	false

Any failures in the coming battles will certainly not be down to the firearms themselves, but the throng is still rather wet around the ears when it comes to artillery warfare. The new gun crews are in dire need of battlefield drilling, with the blood they spill now no doubt earning the Bloodthirster's attention later.	false
missions_localised_description_wh3_dlc25_mis_dwf_malakai_exalted_bloodthirster_4	The Exalted Bloodthirster responsible for the recent Chaos upsurge will prove a deadly foe, capable of crushing the skulls of any brave enough to face it. If there is anything to be learned from the slaughter in the Holds left in the creature's wake, its that more than mere courage will be required to best it. Gather your strength and sharpen your mind, for this challenge demands the deadliest of inventions, wielded by a champion at the height of their power.	false
missions_localised_description_wh3_dlc25_mis_dwf_malakai_exalted_bloodthirster_5	The Daemons of Khorne revel in the destruction left in their wake. Yet entities of the Chaos Realm are notoriously hard to track, with the ability to manifest portals which can swallow their entire hosts in the blink of an eye, only to have them later appear elsewhere on the mortal plane. Such rifts have attracted other opportunistic visitors from the other side, meaning that when it rains Daemons, it pours!	false
missions_localised_description_wh3_dlc25_mis_dwf_malakai_exalted_bloodthirster_6	Your new Organ Guns cannot be brought to their full destructive potential a moment too soon! A recent sighting of a Herald of Khorne demands more serious attention than being another opportunity for showing Gotrek up, for this is a Daemon existing solely to fuel others with an irresistible hunger for prolonged war. The Bloodthirster and the rest of the Khorne cannon-fodder will be weaker once it is dead, if only from giving the throng a taste of the greater Daemon-slaying feat to come.	false
missions_localised_description_wh3_dlc25_mis_dwf_malakai_exalted_bloodthirster_narrative_battle	Weeks of tinkering with the war machines and drilling the warriors to fight alongside the Organ Guns has you primed for the bloodiest of battles! The Bloodthirster's ravaging army threatens all with its insatiable lust for all-out slaughter. But once Khorne's wretched pet falls to the barrage of your artillery, many age-old grudges borne of the Bloodthirster's past massacres will also finally be struck from the Dammaz Kron. And not only that – Gotrek will see that you are as great a Slayer as he!	false

missions_localised_description_wh3_dlc25_mis_dwf_malakai_fellow_engineer	On a serendipitously clear day, a report is received of a flare fired into the sky from an unknown source in the distance. After the area it originated from was reconnoitred, it was discovered that the flare was a rudimentary but effective device built by a young Dwarf Engineer – unexpectedly, a member of a lost Dwarf regiment thought to have been wiped out many weeks prior! While being held captive with his force by the Dark Elves, the tinkerer had managed to cobble together a makeshift distress-flare using scrap metal and ignitable ore. Such ingenuity certainly deserves rescue, but aside from that, there are innocent Dwarf and manling lives at stake! All who toil under the Naggarothi do not stay alive for long.	false

missions_localised_description_wh3_dlc25_mis_dwf_malakai_malevolent_tree_spirits_1	Tales of trees uprooting themselves and coming alive are typically the stuff of fables, but the current path of indiscriminate murder by the animated boughs and branches of the Forest Spirits makes their horror all too real for many of the Empire’s citizens. At the centre of the awakenings are the Treemen, beings saturated with magic that rouses others of their kind. One's gnarled and lumbering form has been spotted, it must be brought down before its host grows!	false
missions_localised_description_wh3_dlc25_mis_dwf_malakai_malevolent_tree_spirits_2	As tempting as it may be, one does not simply just waltz into the forest with Flame Cannons set to 'maximum incineration' without first carrying out some reconnaissance and interrogation of the locals. The pesky forest Elves must know something about the mysterious awakening, or perhaps are culpable for it in some way themselves. Diplomacy is rarely the option with the isolationist Fey – it is time to poke the wasp’s nest and see what is revealed.	false
missions_localised_description_wh3_dlc25_mis_dwf_malakai_malevolent_tree_spirits_3	It is thought that the forest magic that twists the trees into violent spirits of bark and branch comes from the same source of arcane energy that rouses the bloodlust of the beasts and monsters that live there. Facing such creatures in their own habitat requires no small amount of practice and understanding of the threats faced when waging war in the wilderness. Put your host’s monster-slaying skills to the test; ready the warriors for the worst the forest might throw at them.	false
missions_localised_description_wh3_dlc25_mis_dwf_malakai_malevolent_tree_spirits_4	The malevolent Treemen devastating the Empire provide a glorious opportunity for doom, but you must resist throwing yourself at the monsters for now. With the Empire invoking age-old oaths to ask for your help, you should first ascertain precisely what it is you are up against – at the very least, to know how much black powder and munitions to bring to the fight. The nobles who saw their lands ravaged by the twisted creatures would be a good place to start.	false

missions_localised_description_wh3_dlc25_mis_dwf_malakai_spider_swarm_1	Slaying an Arachnarok Queen will be a valiant feat worthy of legend, with the likelihood of encountering the scores of Goblins that seek the monster nigh on guaranteed. The grobi masses are nothing to fear, but you know better than to charge into any war without being fully prepared for all outcomes. Be it at a few ragtag tribes or a full-blown gobbo Waaagh!, the Goblin Hewer’s gears need greasing and weathering for the worst of worst-case scenarios!	false
missions_localised_description_wh3_dlc25_mis_dwf_malakai_spider_swarm_2	If your Goblin Hewer's axes are ever to tear through the flesh of both Greenskins and Giant Spiders in a single skirmish, the machine needs to generate the necessary power for its unorthodox projectiles to pierce the hides of all manner of thick-carapaced monsters and beasts. Search out hordes of the grotesques that plague the land and take every opportunity to optimise the mechanisms of the Hewer, for such adjustments will surely prove vital for entering the Spider Queen’s lair. 	false
missions_localised_description_wh3_dlc25_mis_dwf_malakai_spider_swarm_3	It seems the existence of the legendary Arachnarok Queen is no mystery to most Goblins you've had the pleasure of capturing and interrogating.

Perhaps perseverance is the key here – if you beat enough grobi into submission, one of them might reveal something eventually!	false
missions_localised_description_wh3_dlc25_mis_dwf_malakai_spider_swarm_4	Your scouts report a notorious Night Goblin on the prowl, a well-known Hatchling herder who is thought to have supplied many a Spider Mount for his Goblin kin. He too covets the Arachnarok Queen’s eggs, no doubt to bolster the ranks of some Warboss' next wretched Waaagh! Wiping him and his search party from the map would certainly be doing the civilised world a favour, and give the Goblin Hewer its most notable kill yet!	false
missions_localised_description_wh3_dlc25_mis_dwf_malakai_spider_swarm_5	It is little wonder that Goblins are fearless (or stupid) enough to want to enter the inhospitable lair of the Arachnarok Queen. Most of them originate from the notorious Badlands, a landscape of diverse dangers harboured in mist-covered swamps, unnavigable dunes, and trackless rocky barrenness, a habitat not too different from the caverns where the monster will be hunted. To brave this task, you should first familiarise the throng with similar environmental perils to harden them for the challenge ahead.	false
missions_localised_description_wh3_dlc25_mis_dwf_malakai_spider_swarm_6	You want nothing but the toughest Dwarfs operating your beloved brainchild, the famed Goblin Hewer, but the tougher your warriors are the harder pressed they are to be removed from the front lines. Luckily, the well-known dangers of operating your machines means it has not been that difficult to find a cohort of fellow Slayers willing to brave the Hewer's perils. Their only caveat: expand your Slayer numbers so the crew can take turns to attempt seeking their doom on the front lines.	false

With complete incineration being the only surefire way to annihilate an Undead puppet, a precise recipe of incendiary compounds must be used to utterly consume the husks in Gyrobomber flame.

Up to now, your retinue has been mostly spared from the horrors of the necromantically inclined, but in time must learn all the tricks of such a foe .	false

It will not be long before a problem arises that needs dealing with...	false
missions_localised_description_wh3_dlc25_mis_dwf_malakai_warpstone_bomb_3	From the Dwarfs' experience, the Skaven are creatures of low cunning on the open battlefield for the most part, with their diabolical weaponry used primarily to make them a deadly threat at range. Though the danger they pose is miniscule next to the booming might of a Thunderbarge, there would be no harm in familiarising the throng with their uniquely twisted warmongering ways. To any Dwarf who has never fought them, it is a rite of passage to do so!	false

There is no time to find out, with a second Skaven force already scouted and moving up into the mountain passes. Curiously, it is led by a wretched Raki donned in hissing, clanking contraptions, indicating he is a Warlock of sorts. And where the most devious minds of the Skaven go, destruction usually follows!	false
missions_localised_description_wh3_dlc25_mis_dwf_malakai_warpstone_bomb_5	Though the might of your flying machines is a wonder to behold, the Skaven are far too numerous for the Spirit of Grungni to hold back alone.

And now you have once again found what you seek.	false

Such peerless deeds of war you dedicate to Khorne, certain they shall please Him – if only for a time. Blood for the Blood God!	false
missions_localised_description_wh3_dlc26_arbaal_wrath_of_khorne_mission_strong_1	Even the most battle-hardened warlord would not willingly face such odds – against a foe seemingly much greater in strength, without backup or known escape routes, and lacking any other advantage. For one to see such disparity of forces and still have the desire to take the field, it would be called madness or a monumental folly by most. For you, however, the exact opposite is true: there is no finer challenge to be encountered.	false

missions_localised_description_wh3_dlc26_ie_grn_snagla_stage_1	When men from the Empire first cut their frontiers deeper into the surrounding forest, they unwittingly began the bitter War of the Drakwald that continues to this day. Unbeknownst to them, their deepest forays had encroached dangerously close to the most holy of sites to the Forest Goblin tribes, the sacred lands known as the Black Pit, or the Valley of Many Eyes. To stray near that dark and web-strewn place is certain death, for the Forest Goblins will stop at nothing to destroy any interlopers who dare approach it.	false
missions_localised_description_wh3_dlc26_ie_grn_snagla_stage_2	One of the rising legends amongst the Forest Goblins is Snagla Grobspit, a woodcrafty Spider Rider, able to sneak around enemy armies and launch attacks from unexpected quarters. The only survivor of the Redvenom tribe, he thirsts for vengeance by any means, fair or (preferably) foul. His foes whisper that Snagla and his Spider Riders can creep right out of the very shadows, and perhaps it is true.	false

missions_localised_description_wh3_dlc26_ie_ogr_bragg_stage_1	Aside from the Tyrant himself, Bruisers are typically the most imposing Ogres in terms of sheer size, strength and power within a tribe’s pecking order, and often act as enforcers or under-chieftains. As payment for their brawn and fighting skill, they are afforded many privileges. One such benefit is unhindered access to the camp's weapon pile where the best clubs and blades are kept, to be used or refashioned for the Tyrant's closest mates, including the Bruiser himself.	false
missions_localised_description_wh3_dlc26_ie_ogr_bragg_stage_2	Bragg the Gutsman showed great affinity for lopping off heads from a very young age. Yet it was when he created the death-dealing weapon known as the Great Gutgouger that he earned true notoriety, wielding the modified hook-blade with such prowess that he could slice off a foe's head with a mere flick of his powerful wrists. Champions of every race have fallen before Bragg, dismembered by his strange and horrible weapon. He travels from tribe to tribe seeking such killing opportunities and others who may provide them, so is always welcomed as a powerful Bruiser who is useful in a scrap.	false
missions_localised_description_wh3_dlc26_ie_qb_grn_gorbad_forest_bane	Gorbad Ironclaw is always on the warpath, like any great Orc Warboss of renown. Yet he is also a resourceful strategist who knows the importance of keeping an army well-supplied. As his army marauds across the land, he orders da boyz to opportunistically cut down any forest that lies in their path to build arrows, armour, and the horde’s rickety machines of war. Mass deforestation does not sit well with the forest’s inhabitants, however, with Gorbad’s recent excursions catching the attention of the local Beastmen, who need little invitation to go to war, while the forest itself seems to groan and heave with dissatisfaction at the horde’s presence…	false
missions_localised_description_wh3_dlc26_ie_qb_kho_arbaal_destroyer_of_khorne	Arbaal has been cutting a swath of devastation across the realm. True challenges have been few and far between, but recent rumours of usually reclusive Sylvanian Vampire Lords warmongering against the weakling southerners in the region have piqued his interest. He would seek them out at the Northern border of their domain, and give Essen and Sylvania something to truly curdle their dreams at night and haunt them by day. Khorne might find the spectacle of such a battle a satisfactory diversion – and while Vampires may have forgotten the sting of death, they would now face a fate much more final.

For those peaks and crevasses are where legends of the Empire say Khorne’s greatest Bloodletter battled Sigmar for three days, before suffering his one and only defeat in all recorded history. The Daemon still carries a scar from the felling wound inflicted upon him by man’s so-called god-king – an eternal reminder of the debt owed by Sigmar’s inheritors, which he gladly collects. Today, however, the ancient peaks are occupied mostly by Dwarfs, a hardy race of stout but resolute warriors sure to make a doomed stand against him. Skulltaker senses worthy skulls are amongst them and their reaping is imminent, but also something more: a smell of familiar blood that fans the ancient flames of vengeance.	false
missions_localised_description_wh3_dlc26_ie_qb_ogr_golgfag_bugmans_xxxxxx	Golgfag agreed to sell his company's services to the Orc Warboss Gnashrak, interested in the gastronomic merits of having free access to ready-to-eat Goblins. However, in doing so, he didn't expect the multiple gruelling battles they’d have to endure against the Dwarfs of Karak Kadrin. Twice, Golgfag and his Greenskins employers escaped the wrath of the stunted ones, until a third, decisive battle loomed on the horizon. But Golgfag and Gnashrak's alliance was already on shaky ground by that point – the Ogres kept drinking ale and eating Goblins, while the Orc Warboss’ resentment grew in seeing his supplies of booze and fodder gradually dwindle to nothing. As the Dwarf army closes in for the final showdown, Gnashrak has to entice the Ogres to fight once again, perhaps for the last time.	false
missions_localised_description_wh3_dlc26_kho_exiles_of_khorne_scyla_anfingrimm_unlock_1	Scyla Anfingrimm was once the bane of the coastlands from frozen Norsca to faraway Cathay. A bloodthirsty raider and Champion of his tribe, Scyla's name was synonymous with victory and pillage, evoking fear in coastal cities all across the world. Those who raided alongside him saw the fire of a born leader in his eyes.	false
missions_localised_description_wh3_dlc26_kho_exiles_of_khorne_scyla_anfingrimm_unlock_2	In time, Khorne came to notice Scyla’s feats, first gifting him with massive brute strength and hulking, ape-like arms. Grateful for his blessing, Scyla launched even greater raids resulting in destruction beyond compare. Thus, Khorne gifted him with a serpentine tail ending in a snapping maw. With more merciless slaughter came the Blood God’s final gift: the mind of a ravenous beast. Scyla’s transformation into a mindless Chaos Spawn would be complete soon after. Yet carnage recognises carnage. To match such desire to kill and maim in the name of Khorne will surely bring the beast forth so that he may continue to garner his master’s favour through carnage!	false

missions_localised_description_wh3_main_ie_qb_brt_fay_morgianas_mirror	As the Fay Enchantress travels between sacred groves, she draws to her side young children who harbour latent powers, destined to return to serve Bretonnia as Damsels. One such girl particularly favoured by the Lady of the Lake had gifted the Enchantress a most resplendent hand mirror, said to have inexplicable magical properties born of the child’s own power. Such is the artefact’s potency that the Enchantress always takes it to the battlefield whenever forced into violent confrontation. Yet now the power of Morgiana’s Mirror wanes, its power closely tied to the purity of the Bretonnian soil. The only way to restore the mirror to its full potency is to transmit her powers of warding across Carcassonne to help remove all signs of corruption festering across the land.	false
missions_localised_description_wh3_main_ie_qb_brt_louen_armour_of_brilliance	A piece of armour bearing the heraldry of a legendary warrior has been discovered during a holy quest, and is brought before King Louen. Agilulf was once a great Grail Knight who had slain thousands of the world’s foulest monsters by his sword, blinding his foes in combat with his armour’s wondrous sheen. No-one knows what became of him after his last quest, but years of the equipment’s disuse are evident in its dullness. The magical link between the armour's sheen and durability wanes, leaving it brittle – the only way to restore it is to employ a master craftsman to melt it down and reforge it back to its prior brilliance.	false
missions_localised_description_wh3_main_ie_qb_brt_louen_sword_of_couronne	A great mist descends across Bretonnia that even the light of the sun cannot pierce. Beyond it, the distant shouting and smashing of Greenskin hordes, inciting panic across the land. Though many bravely fight back against their incursions, few dare enter the mist save for one elder warrior – a noble Questing Knight – rumoured to be stalking the gloom alone, pledging to purge its evil. The king and his retinue ride to the warrior’s aid, first heading to where he was last sighted. After days of searching, the hero's corpse is found with a journal containing the location of the evil’s source. A place that emanates with the chilling sound of a vast Orc warcamp…	false
missions_localised_description_wh3_main_ie_qb_brt_repanse_defend_or_conquer_crusader	Repanse has felt the Lady’s influence once again, ever guiding her towards the annihilation of the unholy evils of the world. Deep in the desert, beyond the Great Mortis Delta, priests of the dead have already started to ceremonially circumambulate the malevolent ebony symbol known as the Black Pyramid. Repanse regards the structure as no mere temple, but the very beating heart of the evil that blights these sand-strewn lands. The Tomb Kings’ purpose for it is unclear, but her gut instinct tells her that whatever the ritual being enacted, they must all be cut down.	false
missions_localised_description_wh3_main_ie_qb_brt_repanse_defend_or_conquer_guardian	Just off the coast of Repanse’s beloved home dukedom of Lyonesse, the Undead pirates of the sea gather and lurk. The most infamous eldritch admirals of the world have long been enticed to plunder the hoarded wealth of the Land of Chivalry, now consolidating their fleets to mount a massive invasion. There are two things the foul flotilla of creatures did not count on, however – the depth of Repanse’s unwavering piety, and her undeniable favour from the Lady, which shall surely propel her to victory once again!	false
missions_localised_description_wh3_main_ie_qb_brt_repanse_sword_of_lyonesse	Following in the footsteps of the old Questing Knight who previously wielded her mighty sword, Repanse journeys to a desert far from home. Like the Knight before her, she comes to aid an honourable throng of Dwarfs in their fight against unholy forces. Though they have managed to survive against the Undead hordes for generations – even amongst the hardships of the desert – word had been received that they are now in trouble. While tracking them she encounters an oasis, beside which grows a lily akin to the Fleur de Lys that grows abundantly in Bretonnia. A reassuring sign that even here, the Lady watches over Repanse and will smile upon her champion’s actions this day.	false
missions_localised_description_wh3_main_ie_qb_bst_final_battle_taurox	Finally, the beast-paths to the Heart of the Dark are revealed! Taurox had marauded mercilessly through the world, the promise of further gifts of Chaos fuelling his never-ending stampede. His Masters’ true goal, however, had always been to usher the Daemons of Chaos into the world, and only a pilgrimage of sacrifice and Ruin, ending at the Heart of the Dark, would make it so.\\n\\nIt appears others have made the journey also – some with different intentions – but with the final rite within his grasp the Brass Bull will not be denied the Gods’ favour!	false
missions_localised_description_wh3_main_ie_qb_bst_khazrak_one_eye_scourge	The curses of man are many, and now they think to purge the forests of the warherds! Boris Todbringer, Elector Count of Middenland has been sending armies from Middenheim to rid the Drakwald of Gors, slaying bray-kin in vast numbers. He must be made to pay, but his city sits high on the Ulricsberg plateau, making a brute force attack futile. No... a more cunning approach will be needed if the Children of Chaos are to raze his city to ash and ruin. Knowing that the Elector Count is an honourable fool, Khazrak gives the order to spill Middenheimer blood in smaller attacks, using guerrilla tactics to draw him out. Predictably, Todbringer takes the bait.	false
missions_localised_description_wh3_main_ie_qb_bst_khazrak_one_eye_the_dark_mail	This is Khazrak's time, for he embodies the primal force of the forest! He grows tired of rival Beastlord Graktar’s rule, self-proclaimed by his donning of a certain enchanted blackened chainmail. A lame animal should be put out of its misery, even if the deluded creature fails to realise it’s for the best. Having gained wind of Khazrak’s challenge, Graktar is camped near the mannish towns of Kelp and Koldust, gathering his loyal Gors to him, ready to fight back! Using his bestial cunning, the One-Eye sends forces to surround Graktar’s warherd, trapping him in place. The time to strike is now; Graktar is no match, and his Dark Mail will be claimed by the true Beastlord of the Drakwald!	false
missions_localised_description_wh3_main_ie_qb_bst_malagor_the_dark_omen_the_icons_of_vilification	It is not without reason that Malagor is depicted as the arch-foe of Sigmar in tales and wood carvings throughout the Empire. He is the Dark Omen, despiser of all gods in opposition to his Ruinous Masters. The Dark Gods themselves bless Malagor's brayherd, constantly whispering and muttering to him of the work still to do. They send the Dark Omen a vision of a burning temple in Grunberg... ruins of civilisation strewn across Averland... and finally, a smoking, festering carcass of a Griffon. All but the final act of defilement are fulfilled with ease, leaving Malagor with one final target. Upon the destruction of the Knights Griffon will the Crowfather’s foul fetishes be elevated to blasphemous icons of vilification!	false
missions_localised_description_wh3_main_ie_qb_bst_morghur_stave_of_ruinous_corruption	Wherever the Shadowgave treads, a dark tide of ravening madness and mutagenic power corrupts and changes all those around him, whether friend or foe. Containing the essence of Chaos that trails the Master of Skulls is beyond the capability of any mortal means, and even to Morghur himself. No, to harness this power requires rituals with totems made from laboriously obtained materials – Orc spines, Dwarfen skulls, and most burdensome of all, a stolen Waystone of the Asrai. Morghur’s travels had seen him cross paths with such items, thus he needs only to return to his lair to begin his foul ritual. The insidious Elves, however, have not taken kindly to his pilfering and are never far behind.	false
missions_localised_description_wh3_main_ie_qb_bst_taurox_rune_tortured_axes	Taurox has recently been afflicted by yet another blood-soaked vision. While in a momentary trance he bears witness to tall, slender beings ripping still-beating hearts from the chests of victims dragged screaming in terror onto altars awash with blood, against a cacophony of manic drumming and shrill pipes. Coming to his senses, he realises the slender beings of his vision were Dark Elves, or more specifically Witch Elves, who once a year descend on the streets of their own cities in an unbridled celebration of violent murder of their own kin known as Death Night. With the knowledge of what his visions mean, Taurox’s bloodthirst is stronger than ever – he will traverse the Beastpaths to Naggaroth to take part in the bloodshed, where there will be no discerning the Elven murderers from their targets!	false
missions_localised_description_wh3_main_ie_qb_chs_archaon_armour_of_morkar	The Realm of Chaos plays fast and loose with the concept of time... Once a devout Templar Priest of Sigmar, Archaon searched ancient texts for the means to destroy Chaos but was exposed to a terrible truth. Rejecting his former gods, he swore himself to the service of the Dark Masters instead. He had also discovered scrolls detailing several artefacts of power and a great warrior who used them to gain the blessing of [[i]]all[[/i]] the Ruinous Powers. Archaon vowed to become this man. Thus he must travel to a monolith in the Chaos Wastes raised to the glory of a Chaos Champion, where the twisted ground is littered with skulls from whence screams of malice arise –  “A challenger comes!”.	false
missions_localised_description_wh3_main_ie_qb_chs_archaon_crown_of_domination	The earth groans before the might of Archaon. Having gained the favour of all the Chaos Gods, he stands on the brink of destiny. The Winds of Magic howl from the uttermost north where the gates between worlds strain and then burst asunder, admitting a single diabolical form. A Daemonic champion, a Lord of Change, comes to offer a final test to the man who would unite all of the forces of Chaos into an unholy horde bent on subjugating the entire mortal world.	false
missions_localised_description_wh3_main_ie_qb_chs_archaon_eye_of_sheerian	Archaon has seen his own destiny, revealed to him in the heretical manuscripts of Necrodomo the Insane, who tore out his own eyes after having a vision of the destruction of the world at Archaon’s hands. And now, another vision howled to him by a Sorcerer under his thrall – of mountains twisted into fantastical shapes with gaping maws jutting out of cliff faces, bellowing to be fed the flesh of mortals. Before it, a bloodstained plain bordered by a forest of trees contorted into blackened skeletons, straining their branches towards warm-blooded creatures. In the tumultuous skies overhead, winged death swoops. A once-noble ruler of the skies, now corrupt with Change, a two-headed Dragon of Chaos trumpets its challenge.	false
missions_localised_description_wh3_main_ie_qb_chs_archaon_slayer_of_kings	As Archaon rides onward, many challenge him, but none can stand before his might. Sparing those who swear fealty, he slays the rest, claiming their warbands as his own by right of conquest. Now he receives word of another challenger, one who will not bend the knee. A mighty Chaos Sorcerer Lord defies him, daring to offer battle with a horde of warriors under his command. The sorcerer wields the wild energies of entropy itself, reshaping reality to better serve his whims and those of his dark masters. A word and a gesture from him can strip the flesh from a man’s bones, or cause a regiment of soldiers to burst into flames. Archaon makes his final preparations to pit the martial might of his troops against the raw magical power of his adversary.	false
missions_localised_description_wh3_main_ie_qb_chs_kholek_suneater_starcrusher	Far to the north, deep in the roots of the mountains, Kholek Suneater had slept for generations. Hundreds of Northmen knelt in the pelting hail and snow, chanting sonorously as tribute after screaming tribute was hurled down into his cavernous lair, until a mighty crash of thunder and scintillating display of lightning brought Kholek forth. Yet since that day his rage had not quelled, for Starcrusher, his gigantic arcane hammer, had gone missing. Word now reaches him that it lies in the ruins of Todtheim, an ancient city being fought over by its winged Undead residents and Orcs. Kholek is the greater threat by far, and when he comes to reclaim Starcrusher, the thieves will know the true meaning of annihilation.	false
missions_localised_description_wh3_main_ie_qb_chs_prince_sigvald_auric_armour	Prince Sigvald is not happy. The field of battle is his playground, where his dark father can revel in his son’s cruel deeds. But it is also a place of squalor, of mud, blood and ordure. In every battle, Sigvald is inconvenienced by the need to clean some vile taint from his otherwise spotless battle gear, be it dirt or the lifeblood of his latest victim. Serendipitously, Sigvald has located a Chaos Lord who dons a shining baroque armour of ensorcelled gold, forever untarnished by age or the tiniest fleck of dirt and surrounded by warm perfumed air. The Geld-Prince knows he must achieve this perfection in both form and function as he blesses the battlefield with new depths of cruelty.	false
missions_localised_description_wh3_main_ie_qb_chs_prince_sigvald_sliverslash	Jealousy – an ugly word to some, sinful even. Yet what man or woman fortunate enough to behold the scion of Slaanesh can help but harbour a kernel of envy at his cruel perfection? Flanked by scores of devoted admirers wherever he goes, a callous and deadly Lord of battle, and spoiled by his indulgent adoptive father Slaanesh, the Geld-Prince’s every wildly excessive wish is made manifest. But such renown has its price. All devotees of Chaos are forever searching for more power and the chance to attract the eye of the Gods. Now a rival challenges Prince Sigvald the Magnificent, driven by envy and a lust for power, and with an army of hideous beasts repellent to the Geld-Prince.	false
missions_localised_description_wh3_main_ie_qb_cst_aranessa_krakens_bane	A band of Norscan raiders have declared war upon Manann himself in the name of their Chaos Gods, slaughtering innocent creatures of the sea. The raiding parties are under orders from their Skjold chieftain, who claims that the Queen of Tides is his daughter who he’d thought dead. He had thrown Aranessa into the ocean as a baby, believing she would attract the ire of the Dark Gods due to the mutations she bore. The Skjold chieftain mobilised his fleet as soon as he learned that Aranessa was still alive, believing that by murdering as many sea creatures as possible, he could prove his rejection of Aranessa before the Gods. The Queen of Tides, favoured by Manann, will ensure both she and the Sea-God have their revenge!	false
missions_localised_description_wh3_main_ie_qb_cst_cylostra_the_bordeleaux_flabellum	A self-obsessed singer needs a doting audience, and Cylostra is technically still well overdue for a high-profile performance before the High Elves of Ulthuan. Many years ago, the Lamprey succumbed to a storm in the Eastern Straits of the Great Ocean during an important diplomatic voyage to take Cylostra to sing before the Phoenix King. A treaty of great import was reliant on his pleasure in her performance, for the Elves believe good art – music in particular – to be as valuable as gems and gold. It was an important engagement, so surely the High Elves will still be waiting for her?	false
missions_localised_description_wh3_main_ie_qb_cst_harkon_quest_for_slann_gold	The powerful species of Lizardmen known as the Slann are known to use many enchanted totems and trinkets of gold to serve their indecipherable purposes. The best chance for Luthor to find one for his own ends is to search the ruins of long-abandoned cities and towns of Lustria and beyond, where they were most likely to have left their mark. He hears of a hoard of gold recently stolen back from an expeditionary force in an unprecedented attack – a hoard likely of great importance to the Lizardmen due to the force used to take it back. Luthor can see his goal clearly now, his mind yearning to be repaired. He needs to gather his minions and attack these cold-blooded freaks!	false
missions_localised_description_wh3_main_ie_qb_cst_noctilus_captain_roths_moondial	Captain Roth, leader of the Grand Alliance, was known for being Noctilus’ one-time arch-rival, after one of Noctilus’ midnight raids led to the demise of Roth’s entire family. This led the anguished captain to lead a fleet directly to the Galleon’s Graveyard, a navigational feat only made possible with his magical moondial. Neither Noctilus or Roth were defeated outright in the immense sea battle that followed, but both suffered extensive casualties. The horrors Roth’s crew witnessed there pushed many to desert following the battle. During the confusion, his moondial was opportunistically stolen, ensuring that the graveyard could never easily be found again. Until now…	false

It is time for Hellebron to gather her most vicious sisters and thralls, and occupy the Shrine of Khaine. Only then will the Amulet of Dark Fire ignite.	false
missions_localised_description_wh3_main_ie_qb_def_hellebron_deathsword_and_the_cursed_blade	The twin weapons of the Blood Queen have severed one head too many. Their cruel steel has dulled after years of bloodletting, for the secrets of their endurance and renewal are jealously guarded by Morathi, First of the Hag Queens. It is she who also denies Crone Hellebron the gift of life eternal. The time has come for Hellebron to learn both rites... If it’s war the whore queen wants, it’s war she will get. In glorious, bloody battle, the Deathsword and the Cursed Blade will sing again. Then, at long last, the Murderess of Khaine will tear the secrets of eternal youth and beauty from her hated opposite.	false
missions_localised_description_wh3_main_ie_qb_def_lokhir_red_blades	Lokhir’s famed dual swords, the Red Blades, have slain many foes for the Corsair King. However, the power imbued within them, drawn from the Ind God Gilgadresh’s statue, is failing. The only way to restore the blades to their former state is to regularly gorge them with blood – but not just any blood, for only the blood of the most anguished victims will sate them. For Lokhir, Karond Kar is an obvious target of conquest for these ends – also known as ‘Slaver’s Gate’, it is home to many slaves living the final minutes, hours, or days of their pitiful lives as miserable drudges. The readily available blood of these thralls, downtrodden then sacrificed, shall be more than enough to slake the Red Blades once again!	false
missions_localised_description_wh3_main_ie_qb_def_malekith_armour_of_midnight	Driven by an insatiable hatred, Malekith hungers for the vicious savagery of war. The High Elves, with their haughty and superior manner, are in dire need of reminding just how strong the Witch King of Naggaroth truly is. Their fear will be a delightful tonic indeed! Even were it not so, the methods of science and sorcery push him to battle regardless, for new runes decorate the metal encasing Malekith's burned and twisted flesh. It is said that only blood will activate their power, turning his metal prison into an even greater armour of unfathomable resistance. What better way then, to access such power, than to anoint the runed plates of meteoric iron in the blood of his most hated foes?	false
missions_localised_description_wh3_main_ie_qb_def_malekith_circlet_of_iron	The Great Vortex is in flux! He who strikes fast enough might harness its immeasurable energies – and wrest the power of Chaos from the gods themselves. This is an opportunity the Witch King cannot refuse. After brutally coaxing the secrets of safe passage through the Vortex from Khaine's Death Hags, Malekith journeys far north, to the Altar of Ultimate Darkness. This shrine of pure Chaos can imbue his ancient Circlet of Iron with enough might to subjugate even the Ruinous Powers. But the Dark Gods have foreseen his outrageous intent…	false
missions_localised_description_wh3_main_ie_qb_def_malekith_destroyer	Vaul, Maker-God of the Elves, has long refused to honour Malekith’s masterful forging of the dread blade Destroyer. This snub can stand no longer. If god will not come to the Witch King, the Witch King will come to god – and present to him a blade slaked with Asur blood. Countless fall to the Destroyer on Ulthuan’s shores, but ahead lies the greatest of tests. On to Vaul’s Anvil, into the very heart of the volcano, and then an audience with the god. Of course, there will be guardians to first contend with…	false
missions_localised_description_wh3_main_ie_qb_def_malekith_supreme_spellshield	The Witch King has gained and lost countless arcane artefacts over his long centuries of tyranny. Though Malekith rarely mourns these losses (all such trinkets are merely means to a greater end), he cannot abide another to possess them. Thus he pays rare attention when he discovers that his long-misplaced Supreme Spellshield is now in the taloned hands of the Cold Ones. To the depths of the Mosquito Swamps, then, where a Slann Mage-Priest will be made to part with Malekith’s lost artefact…	false
missions_localised_description_wh3_main_ie_qb_def_malus_warpsword_of_khaine	Malus feels the power of his Warpsword of Khaine waning. The hilt is cold, where once it radiated warmth like the hottest Dwarf furnace. The blade is dull, no longer cutting through steel as though it were butter, no longer guiding Malus' strikes with the deadly precision with which he was once gifted. The blade hungers for blood, and feeding it will be the only way to bring it back to its former power. Bloodshed cannot be avoided then – Malus must return to the Chaos Wastes and face the followers of Chaos in person. It is there, where he first took up the Warpsword of Khaine, that the ravenous blade will have its fill and, finally, fully renew its deadly power.	false

The Witch King has banished Morathi from his sight, angered by some perceived slight. The Hag Sorceress churlishly casts aside her wicked spear, Heartrender, and its sister blade, the Darksword, incensed by the mere sight of these once-prized gifts from her child. Countless souls know torment as the Druchii Sorceress wages a campaign of sadistic terror across the land. Yet still the Witch King pays no heed. The absolute destruction of the High Elf colony of Arnheim, a stubborn canker on the Black Coast, would surely win back her son’s eternal love. Then, Morathi can once more take cruel pleasure in employing Heartrender and the Darksword as her chosen tools of torture.	false

This ‘zoo’ – what an absurd word! – is said to contain some rather delectable specimens, including a fully-grown Dragon, the personal mount of the so-called Emperor of Men.\\n\\nThe very audacity of it!

As it docks, an ominous fog creeps towards the port of Albion, the stirrings of magic engulfing the Ark in its heavy mist. Figures move in the dark, appearing and disappearing as the sound of chains being broken carries across the tension in the air. The Lizardmen, many report, led by the ancient Kroxigor Nakai, have come to free the Lustrian beasts. If Rakarth is to keep his treasures, then there is reptilian blood to be spilled, and the fury of rabid beasts to be unleashed. To the victor shall go the spoils of Lustria, and Rakarth is not one to let his prizes slip so easily from his grasp.	false

He reveals the location of the vault’s secret door to Belegar; King Lunn’s hammer will be in its rightful owner’s hands again soon enough.	false
missions_localised_description_wh3_main_ie_qb_dwf_belegar_ironhammer_shield_of_defiance	An Orc Warboss has taken Dawi he had found imprisoned deep under Black Crag and all but forgotten by their jailer, Gorfang Rotgut. The Warboss stole away the Dwarf captives and, under enslavement, forced them to dig new passages within the Underway, secret to all but his own rabble of filthy Orcs. Belegar is outraged! He at once recognises the captive Dawi as kin – fine folk taken from Karak Azul in a raid years past. This is a fell deed that demands vengeance! However, Ironhammer knows it is not a grudge he can right on its own; King Kazador of Karak Azul still broods on this outrage and so must be informed at once. Belegar doesn't hesitate and sends his shield as his oath.	false
missions_localised_description_wh3_main_ie_qb_dwf_grombrindal_armour_of_glimril	A group of Rangers make contact with the White Dwarf to relay a message – that none other than the greatest Brewmaster himself, Josef Bugman, is in need of the White Dwarf's aid. After Grombrindal makes the long journey to the legendary brewery, Bugman recounts to him a tale of woe and fell magicks that has all the hallmarks of the Ruinous Powers. It seems a Chaos Lord is loose in the Reikwald, performing fell rituals that corrupt Beastmen tribes to his will and saturate the Cloven Ones in Dark Magic, making them an even greater threat than normal. So far the umgi of Sigmar have proven no match for these corrupted warherds. It is time for the Dawi to take matters into their own hands.	false

However, the Dwarfs shall not lie meekly in the frost and ice – they are led by the White Dwarf, who has placed an oath upon his axe. Only when this legion of the damned is slaughtered will the many entwined runes upon Grombrindal's weapon burn with power again! 	false

The rune is now in place and the location of the Undead has been revealed. Although the cloak has been drained of its usual properties, they will no doubt return when this grudge has been settled! The White Dwarf must purge this Undead incursion into the Karaz Ankor at once! 	false

The White Dwarf appears at the forefront of such struggles, as he has done throughout history. His Rune Helm – forged in the glorious forges of Zhufbar – glows, replenishing lost Dwarfen courage, a commodity that is rarely lacking in the first place, of course. With the help of none other than Gotrek Gurnisson, the Waaagh! finds itself isolated by Grombrindal’s throng, unable to sustain itself. Grombrindal lures the beleaguered Orcs to a battlefield of his choosing, using a simple bait and switch manoeuvre with volunteers from Karak Azul. And so it is that Rune Helm will glow bright once more, instilling Dwarfs with heart and courage at Thundering Falls!	false

missions_localised_description_wh3_main_ie_qb_dwf_thorek_klad_brakak	For such a long time has Thorek smashed his way through the dense jungles of Lustria that the powerful runes embedded within his mighty hammer have slowly begun to fade. For truly powerful replacement runes to be forged, however, they must be made in the old way, with ancient, powerful reagents. And there is one clear way to get them: hunt down the biggest, meanest creature in all of Lustria! Thorek's expedition crashes eagerly through the jungle in pursuit of the monstrous creature they call "The Big One", knowing that the beast's inflated bladder will make a fine bellows, and any runes quenched in its antediluvian blood will add mettle to the iron of Klad Brakak. The party finally closes in for the kill, yet as triumph beckons, something else stirs within the jungle. 	false

Countless numbers of Trolls and Giants, displaced by the increased competition for food and territory, are a threat to Kraka Drak, whilst others encroach into the World's Edge Mountains and other civilised lands. It is time for a cull, and whenever there is a foul monster in need of vanquishing, there you will find the Slayers: death-sworn followers of the Slayer Cult, and therefore ever in search of the most dangerous adversaries upon which to unleash their mighty axe-craft.	false

The High King's scout reports the presence of numerous Orc and Goblin warriors engaged in some sort of ritual activity which appears to be centred around several Shamans. Given that the Pillar of Bone is known to be a nexus of arcane power, Thorgrim is determined to disrupt the ritual and orders the battle horns sounded.	false
missions_localised_description_wh3_main_ie_qb_dwf_thorgrim_grudgebearer_book_of_grudges	A dark cloud has descended over Sylvania, and in the midst of its gloom Thorgrim’s scouts stumble upon several sacked caravans, surrounded with the broken detritus of a desperate fight. Though there are no corpses, a freezing dread pervades the area. Shambling figures emerge from the fog – the dead walk Sylvania’s benighted land once more, bands of the Undead lurching northwards toward the vile fog-enshrouded marshes of Hel Fenn! Sprinkling sand on the fresh ink with which he has recorded all of this, Thorgrim slams shut the Book of Grudges, ordering the horns to be sounded and the throng armed. Evil stalks Sylvania and the axes of the Dwarfs will oppose it, and as of old, they will face it at Hel Fenn.	false
missions_localised_description_wh3_main_ie_qb_dwf_thorgrim_grudgebearer_dragon_crown_of_karaz	There are dire tidings from the south. Rangers report that a brutal Orc Warboss has arisen and that hordes of Greenskins are flocking to fight under his leadership. A mighty Waaagh! is forming and seems to be heading north toward the gateway to the Empire’s southern border: the fabled Black Fire Pass. This route through the mountains has witnessed countless titanic struggles over the centuries, many of them pivotal to the survival of the Old World, where Dwarfs and men stood together to hold back disaster, and will again.	false
missions_localised_description_wh3_main_ie_qb_dwf_ungrim_ironfist_axe_of_dargo	In his last battle, a reverie came upon Ungrim again. Whilst in the midst of slaying, he felt a discordant note amongst the otherwise perfect rhythm of battle. The Guild’s council suspect that in revealing its song to Ungrim, his axe was attempting to make itself whole once more, a feat only possible in a high place closer to the Ancestor Gods, and against an adversary of great skill in battlecraft. Thus, the Slayer King must march upon a great Ruinous host entrenched in the mountains beneath the dread banner of a mighty Lord of Chaos. As the throng travels north, the symphony rises to a crescendo and Ungrim’s axe pulses in his hands…	false
missions_localised_description_wh3_main_ie_qb_dwf_ungrim_ironfist_dragon_cloak_of_fyrskar	A message has arrived from High King Thorgrim Grudgebearer. The scroll is a long one, with well over half detailing the many enmities recorded in the Great Book of Grudges against the foul Greenskins. Now Thorgrim plans to set in motion a campaign to strike a telling blow against the urks and grobi, so that their stain might be erased from the face of the Old World once and for all. Summoning a trusted champion, Ungrim instructs him to infiltrate a Greenskin settlement and plant a scroll indicating the presence of a secret tunnel entrance in Broken Leg Gully and leading to the nearby Hold of Karak Kadrin. Such a tunnel doesn’t exist, but the dim-witted Greenskins will surely take the bait.	false
missions_localised_description_wh3_main_ie_qb_dwf_ungrim_ironfist_slayer_crown	Dark clouds have enveloped the accursed province of Sylvania. Such a spectacle has not been seen since Count Mannfred von Carstein, the Vampire Lord of that realm, was last vanquished. Now reports reach Ungrim of sinister, black-robed old men roaming the high peaks. He suspects that death has regained mastery of Sylvania and the interlopers herald the spread of its corruption to neighbouring regions. The Slayer King must act to protect his people. Ungrim's throng tracks the Undead armies down to an entrance to a great cave, where a pale figure in a black cloak stands with arms upraised, a pale nimbus of liche-light surrounding him. Eerie words of summoning drift upon the chill wind. Though the Vampire Lord seems absorbed with his rite, the dead who serve him are not.	false
missions_localised_description_wh3_main_ie_qb_emp_balthasar_gelt_amulet_of_sea_gold	A number of strange incidents have occurred within the Empire of late. Tombs have been desecrated and libraries have been broken into. The Emperor's spies report that the intrusions are connected to a magical amulet, believed to have been buried in the tomb of a powerful Lord centuries ago. Gelt's investigations eventually lead him to a location in distant Estalia. As he leads his men beneath a rough stone lintel of an ancient barrow mound, shadows crowd in upon him, dimming even the light emanating from his raised staff. Ominous sounds echo in the gloom – bone on stone, pitted blade on rusted scabbard. It seems that the loyalty of this buried king's ancient retainers remains firm even in death.	false

He has laboured long in probing its secrets, and inevitably these studies have led him towards solving the ultimate mystery of transmutation – the permanent transformation of base iron into gold. His research reveals the process of transmutation to be dangerously unpredictable, but recent first-hand experiences of the forces involved gives him an insight into an artefact that may reduce the risk. Further investigation leads him to the location of an ill-omened cave, shunned by any unfortunate enough to live in its vicinity...	false

The competition even to become a candidate is white hot. Balthasar Gelt is the Patriarch of the Gold Order and tipped to win, but a rival Light Wizard, Gottfried Orr, desperate for the position, wants rid of Gelt before they even reach the Hall of Duels. After procuring a valuable lodestone at the southern tip of the World’s Edge Mountains, Gelt retraces his steps to Altdorf, confident that it will see off Orr’s challenge.

The Celestial Wizards have been concerned by unusual eddies within the Wind of Azyr that portend doom for the Empire. Triangulating the source of the threat, it is revealed that a great Orc Warboss has arisen somewhere in the lands south of the Black Mountains. His fearsome reputation has gathered many Greenskin tribes behind him in a Waaagh! which is now headed for the main route from the Badlands into the Empire: Black Fire Pass. Whilst messengers are dispatched to alert the Dwarfs, Karl Franz prepares to face the Greenskin onslaught, aware that this is the greatest test that he has yet faced in his reign as Emperor.	false

Wards that should not open for anyone but the Grand Theogonist or the Emperor have been cracked – this is no mundane thief. A mysterious woman was seen fleeing to the east of Altdorf upon a steed of bone with a fell green glow about it, indicating she must be an agent of the Undead. Thus the hunt is directed to the historical centre of Undead activity in the area: Sylvania. After days spent tracking the Vampiress (for such she seems to be), she is brought to bay near a shrine of ill omen, where she raises an army of corpses with which to defend herself.	false

It was on one such doomed campaign that the Jade Griffon – a talisman of the Theogonist's office, said to have been blessed by Magnus the Pious himself – went missing. The Grand Theogonist senses that the time is right to go in search of this precious antiquity, but Mannfred von Carstein's Undead hordes have somehow unearthed the Jade Griffon first, Sigmar damn them!

Recently, wary villagers in Reikland have spoken of priests of the Wolf God, Ulric, besmirching Volkmar's name. Tensions between the cults of Sigmar and Ulric are often fraught, but cordial. However, ever since Volkmar and his Arch Lectors voted against the Ar-Ulric's candidate in the election for Emperor, relations have been strained. Now, the Staff of Command – the symbol of the Grand Theogonist's office – has been reluctantly taken and locked away by the Holy Order of Sigmar, such is the feeling stoked against Volkmar. The Grand Theogonist is in a rage! The slurs of Ulric's supporters must be answered.	false

With his men champing at the bit to right the wrongs perpetrated against their kin, the expedition is soon in full march, full of vim and vigour and a desire to see the Lizardmen pay a heavy price for their crimes.

In a dreamy voice he says that Gork an' Mork are pleased that Azhag has "stopped muckin' about and got stuck in ta da fightin'". They'll overlook his wearing of the humie Necromancer's crown for now. The Shaman declares that Azhag just needs one final bloodbath, one more bout of carnage, and the Great Green will enter his armour and make it properly 'Ard! Down in Bretonnia, those stoopid humies prance about on their ponies on the burial mound of Grudsnik. No wonder the gods ain't 'appy, dat's 'allowed ground. Go give 'em a big slap...	false

But it was there that Azhag found his ancient crown, steeped in Dark Magic. Ever since, the crown has provided him with dark powers and useful, if occasionally confusing, advice, allowing Azhag to seize control of the mighty fortress of Red Eye Mountain. Now the crown whispers for further power, for it is missing a piece that was left behind when Azhag first snatched the crown from the underground ruins of the ancient ‘umie city of Todtheim. The Chaos Wastes are a weird and dangerous place, but the faint whispering voice of ancient evil within Azhag’s head grows ever louder. The crown yearns to be whole again!	false
missions_localised_description_wh3_main_ie_qb_grn_azhag_the_slaughterer_slaggas_slashas	Azhag really wants to go south. Not all that unusual for an Orc brought up in Troll Country, after all, the squishiest humies and shiniest loot is in the Empire. But Azhag's top Bosses know, that's not why he wants to go south – something else is pushing him to go that way. He is prone to bouts of staring into space or arguing with his magical crown, but when he snaps out of this he is the old Azhag, intent on "fightin' and lootin'". In the Southern Badlands, the primitive Savage Orcs gather to hinder Azhag’s horde. The Slaughterer needs to dominate these tribes, so forces the Savage Orcs, led by some git called ‘Slagga’, to acknowledge him!	false
missions_localised_description_wh3_main_ie_qb_grn_final_battle_grom	For his corpulent majesty and his ravenous Broken Axe tribe, Tor Yvresse is not just another place to go for a good fight. When lolling about following his grand meals, Grom would frequently daydream and relive the joyful furor of defacing the city’s slender columns and shiny buildings, polluting the glistening fountains with blood and muck, and ripping the heads and limbs off the great statues of pointy-‘eads (and real pointy-‘eads too). To the Goblin King, Tor Yvresse represents the pinnacle of all the Greenskins’ ambitions for conquest and ruination – truly, “da biggest prize”.\\n\\nThe first time around, the prophecies of the Shaman ol’ Blacktoof had fortuitously landed Grom right on Yvresse’s shores, but this time it had been a much less easy feat. Finally, however, he is strong enough to penetrate the bothersome mists floating around the place. It is time to mobilise his Waaagh! once more; this time, Grom will see Tor Yvresse’s destruction through to the end!	false

Something is clearly brewing. Anything that might bring the stunties out from behind the doors of their mountain fastnesses has got to be good news. It turns out that a force of Chaos Warriors is approaching High Pass in the northern World's Edge Mountains. They are clearly returning north from the Dark Lands where they are known to trade with the wicked Chaos Dwarfs for items of power, angering the other stunties. With the scent of battle in his nostrils, Grimgor marches over the reporting scout, heading north.	false

Presumably, the magic choppa remains with his corpse. All indications are that the humies remain in the pass, preparing to march back up north, but they might be persuaded to stay long enough for Grimgor to have a crack at them. The Black Orc Warboss orders his mob to march on the pass, and to announce their approach by burning everything en route. The humie scum will have no choice but to stay and face a far deadlier threat than that 'pretenda' that now lies rotting in the pass!	false

Grom swiftly sought him out and, disappointed at the meek appearance of his adversary, demanded the return of his axe so he could promptly chop the git to bits with it for his impudent lies and thievery. The Night Goblin Warboss denied all knowledge of the theft, however, claiming that he was the victim of a slanderous set-up. His denials were convincing, but Grom had already gone to the effort of getting the boyz together and marching them over there, so Git Guzzler was going to get guzzled nonetheless.	false

His once-vigorous waving has become tired and listless, failing to inspire the boyz as it once did. If it were any other Goblin, they would find themselves crushed beneath Grom's rump as punishment – but Niblet had notably survived such an ordeal before, and has Grom's favour as a result.\\n\\nGrom decides instead to look for a way to restore Niblet's enthusiasm.

missions_localised_description_wh3_main_ie_qb_grn_skarsnik_skarsniks_prodder	Lately, the diminutive Goblin boss Skarsnik couldn’t help but brood – how can he impose his will if an Orc has a better reach? Maybe he needs a long stick like those wizards always carry around with them? This gives the Warlord an idea. He takes a wicked-lookin' halberd from his pile of shiny stuff which may have belonged to a humie wizard or one of them long-eared gits, planning to smear the new 'prodder' in the spent blood of stunties.

Now that is fightin’ talk! The gobbo even sends one of his followers to slay Wurzzag, but you don’t get to be Mork and Gork’s best mate if you could be so easily shiv'd! Wurrzag foils the attack with ease, but it turns out the would-be killer was merely a diversion! While the Shaman was dealing with the assassin, his mask – an important part of his mantle as da Great Green Prophet – is stolen.

Da Prophet finally emerges from his ramshackle hut, revealing they must go to Black Fire Pass, where a defensive force of the Empire intends to trap them. Wurrzag is unperturbed, even when his spies inform him that a vanguard of the Empire's heroes have sworn to bring the Savage Orc Shaman’s head directly to Karl Franz.

The beast was once a rival Shaman until magical energy arched from Wurrzag’s eyes and instantly transformed him into the Squiggly Beast that has been Da Prophet’s companion ever since. And so when Wurrzag woke from a deep trance to find the Squiggly Beast had gone missing, he was not at all pleased. It had been stolen by a Goblin Warboss known as Gashtoof, who is feeding stolen Squigs mushrooms that grow upon "glowy green rock", causing them to grow in size and become even more vicious!

Though his resolve never weakens, alas his fabled Dragon Armour of Aenarion does. A lucky strike, perhaps? Or perhaps this was the Witch King’s intent? In any event, the armour must be taken to Vaul’s Anvil, the place of its ancient forging, for repair. The smiths of the great volcano have barely begun their work when the battle horn is sounded. The Druchii legions have followed Tyrion to Vaul’s shrine, believing him trapped, helpless – and armourless. Tyrion prepares his host for war; though he is bereft of his usual protection, he will face the hated foe without fear.	false
missions_localised_description_wh3_main_ie_qb_hef_tyrion_heart_of_avelorn	"My liege, as you are all too aware, without the fortress gates in the north of Ulthuan, the Druchii would have scoured the Inner Kingdoms long ago, hollowing out our homeland. And now the Phoenix Gate comes under sustained attack. Our Dark Elf-kin hope the failing Vortex will keep us distracted long enough for them to breach it, but Avelorn lies beyond and the Everqueen herself may be put in harm's reach. She and the Inner Kingdoms must be protected – the Fortress Gate has to hold!"	false
missions_localised_description_wh3_main_ie_qb_hef_tyrion_sunfang	Tyrion’s legend wanes upon poison rumour that his prowess is an illusion and due only to Sunfang, the enchanted blade he took as his own. Tyrion could ignore such bunkum, but pride prevents it. The crusade that follows is bloody and feverish, but in its wake, none can contest his skill. Back in court, the conniving princes behind the feigned scandal share wicked smiles, for Tyrion has played into their hands. The conspiring courtiers convince the mages of Hoeth that there is only one explanation for his recent aggression – he is a puppet of the Druchii. With remorse, the Loremasters array against him. The Defender of Ulthuan regrets taking arms against fellow Asur, but the scheming princes will pay the blood price for their envy.	false
missions_localised_description_wh3_main_ie_qb_ikit_claw_storm_daemon	Ikit Claw understands very well that direct confrontation with the Lizardmen is not viable, but wiping those tiresome toads from the face of the world always remains a priority. In an effort to weaken them before drawing them into battle, he had set into motion a plan to corrupt their 'blessed' spawning pools by using a Warpstone Tractor Beam to blast the Chaos Moon, raining down fragments and supplying him with bountiful deposits of Warpstone to fuel further experiments. Irritatingly, the ever-watchful Slann Astromancers spotted the falling Warpstone on Ikit’s approach so are fully battle-ready, with additional Lizardmen reinforcements already on their way. Collecting some of the pure, fallen Warpstone from the field, Ikit repairs his deadly Warp-lightning thrower, Storm Daemon, and steels himself for the fray.	false
missions_localised_description_wh3_main_ie_qb_kho_skarbrand_slaughter_and_carnage	Skarbrand's patience, such as it is, is wearing thin. The plan was to await the encroaching Nurgle horde and then for the three Khornate forces to slaughter them in glorious carnage before the Brazen Altar. Plans! What weakness! The farmer plans for the harvest. The maiden plans her wedding. Skarbrand does not scheme! What use plans when there is rage and slaughter? The Wrathful Reaper clashes his axes together and glares at the Bloodthirsters in command of the other Khornate forces. This is their blasphemous folly, this planning and waiting. If Nurgle won't oblige, then Khorne will yet have his due. Blood for the Blood God!	false
missions_localised_description_wh3_main_ie_qb_ksl_boris_armour_of_ursun	This famous armour, said to have been bathed in the breath of the Bear God, has been claimed by Boris Ursus, yet remains inert. The patriarchs of Ursun's Cult say that to rouse the armour's blessed power its true owner must wear it while defending the Motherland from its many enemies and securing the nation's borders from any who would see its populace harmed.\\n\\nAs the Red Tzar stands fearless and resolute against Kislev's foes, then surely it cannot be long before the Armour of Ursun will prove its quality and the folk of the Motherland will find succour and safety in the wake of Boris Bokha's wrath!	false
missions_localised_description_wh3_main_ie_qb_ksl_boris_shard_blade	Carved from Norscan glaciers, and said to hold a permanent hoarfrost about its form that can cut flesh and bone better than Elven steel, the Shard Blade is a deadly polearm once wielded by the Red Tzar. It was recovered along with Boris Ursus, who was found in the ice and saved by the Motherland herself. However, the Shard Blade's latent power seems to have been affected by the Tzar's enforced hibernation. The patriarchs of the Great Orthodoxy, have studied the weapon and declared that its might will return once Radii Bokha has regained the power, influence and love of his people that he had before the fall at the River Lynsk.	false
missions_localised_description_wh3_main_ie_qb_ksl_katarin_crystal_cloak	Tzeentch seeks to weaken Kislev by strengthening the affinity between crystal and ice, thus creating a link between his realm and the Motherland. To do this, he requires the Crystal Cloak. In the confusion of Boris’ death, agents of the Changer stole the Crystal Cloak from the Bokha Palace and now it resides in the centre of the Fractal Maze – a great Tzeentchian labyrinth structured to unravel the cloak and so reveal its power.\\n\\nSoon after her coronation, Katarin sent her own spies to locate the cloak. Their intelligence has led the Ice Queen to the Fractal Maze, and a reckoning with the thieves.	false
missions_localised_description_wh3_main_ie_qb_ksl_katarin_frost_fang	Frost Fang was forged during the reign of Miska. As the blade was hammered into shape, Ice Witches cooled it with their magic, imbuing the blade with magical properties. While the sword has been held in the Bokha arsenal for generations, it is said the true power of the blade can only be invoked when used by a Khan-Queen. Now that Katarin has ascended to the throne, ready and eager to wield it in battle, it is surely but a matter of time before the Frost Fang's true power stirs?\\n\\nThe Ice Queen can awaken the blade by dominating her ancestral lands just as the first Khan-Queen did long ago.	false
missions_localised_description_wh3_main_ie_qb_ksl_kostaltyn_burning_brazier	Kostaltyn tours outlying Kislev provinces. Vast congregations of the simple folk turn out to witness the blessings, the Supreme Patriarch's fiery rhetoric filling their hearts with a rekindled determination to protect the Motherland at all costs. But this increased defiance coupled with the remote and therefore sparsely-defended locations makes these ceremonies an attractive target for Kislev's enemies.\\n\\nIn a coastal village, north of Erengrad, the peasants listen to the words of the Supreme Patriarch as he harangues their weakness and ingratitude, urging them to set aside their own petty concerns and join his crusade against the spreading influence of the Dark Powers in the Tzarina's Ice Court. Out at sea, a storm gathers, the clouds rolling toward the shore. Under their cover, dark shapes move. The Dark Elves have come, eager to slaughter and fill their holds with slaves from amongst the seemingly helpless peasantry. Above even the rising thunder, the shrieking voice of the Supreme Patriarch calls the congregation to give up their lives in defence of the Motherland. These invaders will be thrown back into the waves from whence they came!	false

The ruler of Hexoatl lately questions the ancient Saurus’ adherence to The Great Plan, and demands a brutal demonstration of loyalty. Warm-blooded Elves infect Lustria, and even now interfere with the Fallen Gates, stellar portal of the Old Ones. Who knows what blasphemies their witless tinkering might summon forth? The trespassing Asur must be met with claw and fang, and Kroq-Gar must faithfully serve Mazdamundi’s singular interpretation of The Great Plan – that lesser beings deserve only extermination. 	false

This ancient Old One weapon must be restored to its former glory, no matter the cost. Soon enough, the spear is bathed in the blood of untold foes, and the Last Defender is duly rewarded with a waking vision. Within the distant Well of Time, Tlanxla reaches though the barrier of eons, ready to touch his spear and reignite its faded flame. But others have heard the call of time’s sundering. Dark Elf invaders, curse their warm hearts, surround the Well, thirsty to harness its boundless temporal power. They must be annihilated, so that the Spear may be reborn.	false

After a mystery that spans the Great Ocean, Fellheart learns that a curse has been placed upon the Helm of the Kraken and the only way to lift it is to slay the caster of this abominable hex.

missions_localised_description_wh3_main_ie_qb_lzd_gorrok_the_shield_of_aeons	Once again, the time has come for the Great White Lizard to rid the sacred jungles of Lustria of those degenerate elements that are not part of the Old Ones' Great Plan. Itza is currently under siege from Luthor Harkon's Undead pirate crews and his army of vermin mercenaries – truly the foulest examples of the exceptionally foul Skaven race that the Great White Lizard has ever set eyes upon! As is to be expected from a hardened seaborne pirate, Harkon's force is strong in artillery and has already created several breaches in Itza's ancient walls. Now, Gor-Rok's only option is to prepare for the inevitable assault and trust that Nakai the Wanderer will arrive in time to lift the siege!	false
missions_localised_description_wh3_main_ie_qb_lzd_mazdamundi_cobra_mace_of_mazdamundi	Lord Mazdamundi, greatest of Mage-Priests, senses that the Great Plan is failing. The certain cause is the vile proliferation of warmbloods within his realm. There must come a purge! Yet in this he is thwarted, for since his awakening he is without his fabled Cobra Mace. The semi-sentient weapon of legend was long ago left to regain its fading power from the sacred rocks of the Isle of the Crimson Skull. For the purge to proceed, it must be reclaimed forthwith. Yet darker news awaits. Accursed Skaven swarm across the hallowed isle, covetous of its sorcerous stones. This outrage must be repaid – and only absolute extinction will suffice.	false
missions_localised_description_wh3_main_ie_qb_lzd_mazdamundi_sunburst_standard_of_hexoatl	Lord Mazdamundi scours ancient texts for guidance on how the Great Plan might be served, and learns that Chotec, the Old One who first warmed this world, possessed a star-hot rage akin to his own. A bond shared across time! Perhaps invoking the Ritual of Ferocity could summon the Sun-Lord’s essence, and imbue it within the City of the Sun. The chants begin – and so too do the sacrifices. Chotec’s radiance shall surely arise from the Fallen Gates of Hexoatl, the Old Ones’ cosmic bridge to this realm. The Ruinous Powers cannot permit the wisdom of their ancient enemy to return, however, and send the savage slaves of Chaos to avert it. Mazdamundi must now make his stand – or betray the Great Plan.	false
missions_localised_description_wh3_main_ie_qb_lzd_nakai_golden_tributes	Nakai the Wanderer is encamped in the jungle when his Skink attendants bring news of a disaster threatening the very beating heart of Lustria. That seemingly-irrepressible, utterly insane Vampire Admiral, Luthor Harkon, leader of the Zombie Pirates, is besieging Itza with a full assault on its outer walls. Always plotting, always scheming – like every last one of their nasty little race – his experienced Skaven mercenary contingent are assisting his efforts, using all the perfidious tricks at their disposal. Nakai knows all too well that if the First City is to be preserved – if the Old Ones' Great Plan is to remain undiverted – then swift, direct action is required, without further delay!	false
missions_localised_description_wh3_main_ie_qb_lzd_nakai_the_ogham_shard	The all-knowing, seemingly ever-living Slann have revealed the location of several ancient structures, in locations right across the World Pond, which prevent the forces of Chaos from spilling out into our dimension and marauding across the Old and New Worlds. But it has also come to light that one such 'shard' was now under direct threat from the very faction it was designed to repel. If just a single one falls, the bonds which hold back Chaos would be broken, and all hell would undoubtedly break loose. Nakai’s scouting party reports that the Chaos army have brought their Norscan puppets along for the fray too, but they will be mere fodder for his lightning-fast talons – he will strike fast and weaken their resolve.	false
missions_localised_description_wh3_main_ie_qb_lzd_oxyotl_the_golden_blowpipe_of_ptoohee	Oxyotl recently sensed a growing taint of Chaos on the maniacal Northmen, far greater than the sickness they typically exude. Upon investigation, he learnt of a Chaos-saturated artefact being passed through the Norscan tribes, and no doubt the source of the heightened taint he had detected. The relic originated from a group of Dark Elf slave traders of northernmost Naggaroth, a place of fell magic in close proximity to the Chaos Wastes. Using his mysterious senses, Oxyotl must travel ahead of the Chaos-worshipping Norscans returning to the Dark Elf trading post where the original transaction was made, where an ambush shall be set to bring about the end of this most recent infection of Chaos once and for all.	false
missions_localised_description_wh3_main_ie_qb_lzd_tehenhauin_plaque_of_sotek	The Prophet has enjoyed many victories over the Skaven, and with each pathetic ratman slaughtered and crushed, Sotek’s worldly power grows stronger and his following – the Cult of Sotek – grows greater. With Sotek’s arrival finally at hand, Tehenhauin lays an elaborate trap for the Skaven that he knows still dwell beneath the jungle floors of noble Lustria. If everything goes according to plan, the remaining Skaven host will be driven back and then herded to Gwakmol Crater, where they will be unable to escape their certain fate. Though the Skaven outnumber the Lizardmen many times over, the Prophet’s ever-growing force is empowered by their leader’s undeniable vigour, and they feel assured of victory despite the seemingly insurmountable odds.	false

Soaring above the vast and immense jungles, he caught the distinct stench of the ratmen’s fear-musk still hanging in the humid air. A large Skaven presence is causing damage to the Geomantic Web through the desecration of temple ruins in the area – likely whilst searching for the damnable Warpstone deposits, in turn explaining the weakening of the blessings upon Tiktaq’to’s Mask of Heavens. There is little else to be done but head to their last known location and slaughter every last one of the blasphemous Skaven-spawn with extreme prejudice!	false
missions_localised_description_wh3_main_ie_qb_nor_throgg_wintertooth_crown	Throgg recently became infuriated that he was missing his prized Wintertooth Crown, so headed southward into civilised lands, tearing through the villages and towns in search of it. He had heard of a vast Dwarf convoy travelling from Karak Kadrin, seen moving towards Peak Pass with one particular Runelord in its ranks known to be an infamous hoarder of treasures. Throgg’s scouts tell him that the thieving Runelord does in fact have Throgg’s crown in his possession! Frothing at the mouth in both anger and excitement, Throgg sputters a war cry at his horde to move out, and swiftly. He will eat this thief slowly and painfully, piece by piece, and take back what is rightfully his!	false
missions_localised_description_wh3_main_ie_qb_nor_wulfrik_the_wanderer_sword_of_torgald	Recently, the Gods sent Wulfrik a vision of a great and lauded Bretonnian hero atop a mighty charger. The horseman was drenched in blood, a sign that he was the next quarry. Thus Wulfrik led his army southward, viciously raiding the lands of Bretonnia's capital in an effort to draw the hero out, but he did not appear. He then learnt of a small keep in Lyonesse which contains holy relics, precious treasures, and stately heirlooms, all of which are of great importance to the Bretonnian Kingdom. Seeing the opportunity, Wulfrik has called upon his warband to immediately march south towards the venerated keep to attack it. The hero is yet to show himself, but Wulfrik will get his duel one way or another!	false

The diminutive cave-dwellers have an iron constitution which stubbornly resists Nurgle's blessings, in spite of the Plaguefather's endless experiments. What is needed is a large quantity of test subjects so that Ku'gath can divine what lies at the root of this resistance. Once this is isolated, he can formulate a new wave of plagues of such virulence that even the Dwarfs' senseless recalcitrance will crumble.	false

So when the most powerful Black Orc Warboss of the Mountains of Mourn launches a Waaagh! deep into Ogre territory, Goldtooth moves to bring him to battle on the slopes of the sacred Fire Mouth volcano. Once this usurper has been trodden into the dirt, then Greasus may wear his basin-sized crown with unassailable pride.	false
missions_localised_description_wh3_main_ie_qb_ogr_greasus_sceptre_of_titans	Greasus' mighty sceptre was fashioned by the Sky-Titans, who granted its wielder their strength. Of late, its power has waned; the spells that imbue the sceptre dull, leached of their previous power. The Overtyrant's personal Butcher has taken a good look at the sceptre, and – after trying a few practice swings at some nearby Gnoblars – has declared that the item needs to be boiled in a cauldron of fresh blood to rejuvenate its power.\\n\\nGreasus must set to work gathering the blood he needs by finding fresh prey. Only then, once the sceptre has been prepared in the unfortunates' blood and cooking juices, will the Sceptre of the Titans be restored to its full power!	false
missions_localised_description_wh3_main_ie_qb_ogr_skrag_cauldron_of_the_great_maw	As the Gore Harvester, Skrag is ever on the lookout for fresh meat for his cauldron. Long days spent wandering the under-caves taught the Prophet of the Great Maw to observe the Gorgers which haunt his every step, for their feral senses allow them to root out fresh quarry to satisfy their gnawing hunger. When the Gorger's nostrils flare and their famished eyes gleam red, Skrag knows that slaughter is close at hand, and he has learned to gauge the scale of the potential feast by the Gorgers' silent eagerness. On this day, the Gorgers have spent some time sniffing eagerly beyond the caverns, heading up out of the darkness and into the peaks with saliva stringing from their hideous teeth. Skrag's instinct is that they are on to something big and he follows them, determined that his cauldron will have the greatest share of the flesh glut.	false

However, in their haste it would appear that the scouts were somewhat careless, as they have been followed to Kroak’s location by a force of those insidious ratmen, the Skaven! They plan to destroy him, once and for all, by incinerating his physical remains that anchor him to the world. This must not come to pass – defend Kroak from harm whilst his priests awaken him!	false

Countless loyal Skaven perish as the right-claw of Lord Gnawdwell lashes out in blind fury, outraged by useless theory after useless theory as to the culprit. It is only when one follower fearfully proposes that the deceitful Clan Eshin are surely to blame that Queek stays his gore-drenched paw. The suspicion appears proven by reports that an Eshin agent has recently been sighted making for Dwarf territory. Ratkin in league with beard-things? An outrage! High in his tower, Lord Gnawdwell smiles a vicious smile and pats Dwarf Gouger with mock affection. His protégé has taken the bait: what an entertaining test of Queek’s deadly skill this shall be.	false
missions_localised_description_wh3_main_ie_qb_skv_queek_headtaker_warp_shard_armour	The tempestuous chief enforcer of Clan Mors has never let an insult lie. When a rival clan’s Warlord makes the outrageous claim that he possesses Warpstone armour far superior to Queek’s, the entire Mors war effort is instantly dedicated to ripping out his lying tongue. Any advisor who dares attempt to deter Queek from his self-absorbed path meets a messy end. After countless wasteful skirmishes all across the land, and a stream of further taunts, the vermin braggart is eventually cornered deep below an ancient ruin. At last the Headtaker will prove that there is no more lethal a rat than he – and help himself to some shiny new armour into the bargain. 	false

Tempted in by the promise of worthless trinkets, countless perished as Skrolk cackled with glee. But the greatest reward came when one of the few to reach the pyramid’s heart dared lift the cover of the Liber Bubonicus, sprouting a thousand plague-flies and infecting all those they did not strip to the bone with pox and egg alike. Lord Skrolk’s scheme had been an unqualified success – the Council would surely reward him for this most devious of cullings. First, however, he must himself descend into the Mortuary and reclaim his pestilent prize. But, deep in the dead depths, something now stirs…	false
missions_localised_description_wh3_main_ie_qb_skv_skrolk_rod_of_corruption	Where Skrolk was once the pre-eminent disciple of Arch-Plaguelord Nurglitch, of late his pestilent prowess has been thrown into doubt. Skrolk blames a weakening of his noxious Rod of Corruption, which, though it still effortlessly sloughs flesh from bone, can no longer reduce armour and blade to rust. Perhaps the solution lies with the coldbloods of Lustria who guard the strange wisdom of long-dead races? It is said that one of these is a unique red mineral, able to eat effortlessly through iron and steel. The only source of this substance is the titular relic of the Island of the Crimson Skull. Naturally, the reptiles would willingly die in their droves before parting with it. Plaguelord Skrolk is only too happy to oblige.	false

An ambitious (and foolish) ratling must have been getting help from an unknown source to do this without drawing the attention of the Thirteen. Yet disloyalty begets further disloyalty; a deserter scurries back, telling Snikch exactly what he needs to know. He warns that the traitor has called upon some powerful allies and will soon head out to meet them. This would be a good opportunity to ambush them, then meet and eliminate their new ally!	false

As he attempted to throttle a Rat Ogre to drag into his wretched Flesh Laboratory, one of the prongs on the apparatus’ business end snapped loose, becoming entirely detached. "Uurgh! Mechanical tinker-fixing is for Skryre dregs! Stupid-boring!" Throt lamented out loud as he shoved a Warpstone-laced energy bar into his mouth. He had always been suspicious of Skryre engineers, which he considered "small-brained" for being so obsessed with machinery, when tinkering with natural (and unnatural) anatomy was so much more interesting. But Warlock Engineers have the knowledge and means to restore his legendary weapon, and regardless of his cynicism for the tinker-rats, his beasts weren’t going to throttle themselves.	false

Throt’s underlings back in Hell Pit had clearly lost control of the murderous creations housed within its unspeakable breeding pits – or so he thought. Throt returned expecting to find the city's nine circles overrun by escaped and rampaging abominations, but the truth was far more infuriating: the raging hordes of Chaos blockade Hell Pit's iron and bone gates. No doubt these Ruinous whelps are seeking retribution for their previous, foiled attempt to invade Clan Moulder's carrion-adorned stronghold. Now as then, Throt will drive the spiky-things out – but not before harvesting the choicest morsels for his ghastly experiments (and equally ghastly appetite).	false

But as he prepares to coldly dispatch the Eshin assassin whose lurking reflection he glimpsed in the eye of a passing Clanrat, he notices an unusual detail. An amulet, clearly of Greenskin origin, strung around the rat’s neck... The interrogation is as short as it is horrific, and yields potent reward. A high-ranking rat of a competing Clan is indeed in cahoots with the green-things, a horde of whom intend to decimate Clan Rictus upon Tretch’s death. Protocol prevents direct retaliation against the rival Skaven Lord, but Tretch’s agents soon locate the burrow in which the Greenskins muster. They await orders from their paymasters, quite unaware that Tretch plans to land the mortal blow first...	false

In his headlong flight, he dropped his favoured Daemonic blade at the bottom of the ocean floor, and since that time he has plotted to retrieve it. Judging that the eyes of the High Elves are now elsewhere, N'Kari makes his move, but unbeknownst to him, Elven Mages set wards to scry the area and are alerted to his reappearance. As the Arch-tempter searches the seabed, he discovers an Elven host barring his path, protected from the tides by their accursed Mages.	false

The Liche King believes in one such way to achieve this – to find the long-lost Staff of Nagash, a weapon of boundless arcane might. However, it now rests in the Unliving hand of Settra the Imperishable, the false king, whose newly-empowered bone legions march upon Arkhan’s Black Tower even now. Rallying to the infernal spire’s defence, Arkhan's concern soon grows to mounting horror as rank after rank of Skaven warriors marches into view – a veritable Vermintide! Its warlord holds aloft the Staff of Nagash and laughs a repellent laugh. A subterfuge, then... This is Settra's doing! Arkhan's horror turns to dark rage. Vengeance awaits.	false

How could a mortal achieve such a feat? If Arkhan could bind that ancient king’s soul into his Tomb Blade, he could learn his secrets – and gain his power. The Liche King travels to the distant land reputed to house Alcadizaar’s lost grave, where he is met by a familiar stench – Necromancy! The reptiles of this region must have uncovered its secrets, and mean to raise Alcadizaar themselves. In order that Arkhan can harvest the Priest-King’s soul and unlock the Tomb Blade’s full potential, they must be eradicated...	false

Sure enough, her captivating voice whispers into the Warrior-Queen’s mind. Though Khalida is reassured that Asaph has not forsaken her, there is dire revelation. The cursed Lahmians have desecrated the snake-goddess’ shrine at the Springs of Eternal Life. No wonder the Staff falters so... Though the holy waters can be purified by a rite, the loathsome Vampires are now bound for the Ash River, clearly meaning to spread their Necromantic corruption further.

In his tireless quest to restore Nehekhara to its former glory, he has journeyed to the New World. Having heard rumour that the Dark Elves dabble in the art of resurrection, he follows a trail of whispers to a clandestine Druchii library. There, among the array of magical texts, one tome hums with an even stranger power. Within, its pages offer the impossible – a rite to bind a soul to a living host. A way to renew Settra and his fleshless followers… this would restore Khatep’s honour and station. The liturgy is to first be practiced deep within the Pits of Zardok – surely that way Settra will be safe from any unexpected complications…	false

Suddenly infuriated by this marble testament to the forgotten glories of his youth, the Eternal Sovereign becomes desirous to wield the white-hot sword of legend once more. As Settra draws near to its reliquary in the Charnel Valley, his scouts report activity. A glory-hunting alliance of Dwarfs and men is here in force! The fires of fury are stoked within Settra's withered heart. They dare defile this place! Settra will send a mighty tribute to the Realm of Souls this day!	false
missions_localised_description_wh3_main_ie_qb_tmb_settra_the_crown_of_nehekhara	Settra surveys the world around him and finds it wanting. All will submit to his rule; all will serve the King of Kings. But a king requires a crown, and his has been stolen by tomb-defiling Northmen as he slept away the ages. It must be recovered! His agents bring word of a place deep in the distant Ice Tooth Mountain, where Norscan savages brazenly display wit and wealth far above their barbaric station. Though they know they harbour a relic of great significance, they cannot begin to understand its true import. The Ruler of the Four Horizons will teach them – though, in death, they will not remember his merciless lesson…	false
missions_localised_description_wh3_main_ie_qb_tze_kairos_staff_of_tomorrow	Kairos' contemplation of the Well of Eternity has given him an insight which bodes ill for his master's schemes. The Staff of Tomorrow cannot exist in multiple points across the weave of fate, it will create a paradox that could blind Kairos and hamper Tzeentch's plans for the Great Game. In the moment of comprehension of this fact, the Fateweaver's two heads turn to face each other, and as their eyes meet he is drawn into a plane of existence that is not the present, yet one which lies between past and future. He must defeat both his past and future selves in order to reconfigure events.	false
missions_localised_description_wh3_main_ie_qb_vmp_heinrich_kemmler_chaos_tomb_blade	Kemmler’s forces have intercepted several warbands of Chaos Raiders, their presence suggesting some hidden purpose. He traces their movements onto a glacier in the high peaks. Lost memories return, as he recalls tales of a great Champion of Chaos slain by the hand of Sigmar himself in battle. Could this be the tomb of Krell?	false
missions_localised_description_wh3_main_ie_qb_vmp_heinrich_kemmler_cloak_of_mists	King Marbad fought alongside Sigmar himself in the great wars that saw the birth of the Empire, sacrificing himself to save the man who would unite the tribes of men. Such greatness of spirit is a noble thing for most, but to Kemmler it represents only a potential source of power waiting to be tapped. He receives word of a likely location for Marbad’s tomb in southern Middenland. Its innate power has drawn others to it, and the agent reports that a local tribe of Forest Goblins uses its summit for their rituals. However, no challenge is sufficiently daunting to deny the Lichemaster an opportunity to paw through a trove of ancient grave goods in his unending search for power.	false
missions_localised_description_wh3_main_ie_qb_vmp_heinrich_kemmler_skull_staff	The abbey at La Maisontaal in northern Bretonnia has long held Heinrich Kemmler’s interest. It is a major centre of worship for the Nature-God, Taal, and is therefore worthy of destruction in Kemmler’s eyes. More significantly, it serves as a repository for several powerful artefacts. Unfortunately, the abbey is well defended by the forces of the local duke, meaning that any straightforward attack upon it would prove costly. Fortunately the Lichemaster has put into motion a plan of pleasingly wicked deviousness. 	false
missions_localised_description_wh3_main_ie_qb_vmp_helman_ghorst_liber_noctus	Helman Ghorst is on the hunt. The Necromancer is desperate to reunite all the pages of the Liber Noctus – a book that contains even more powerful enchantments than those written in its sister tome, the Liber Necronomica. Alas, the Cult of Sigmar have caught wind of Ghorst's search and seek to thwart his efforts, tracking the pages to a site where centuries ago a Lahmian cult placed them in a sealed casket and cast them into a deep gorge to keep them out of Nagash's necrotic hands. Following their lead, Helman arrives to see them already excavating the site. The Necromancer prepares an ambush to relieve the Sigmarites of the pages as soon as they have been found!	false
missions_localised_description_wh3_main_ie_qb_vmp_isabella_von_carstein_blood_chalice_of_bathori	While on one of her forays of bloodletting, Isabella happens upon an unrivalled prize. Torn from one of the corpses of a recently slaughtered Beastman is a horn thick with pestilent blood, emanating a ghastly aura. A Ruinous Gift from the Chaos Gods themselves! To simply drink deep of its blighted fluids would surely end Isabella’s Unlife. Fortunately, a rite can purge the blood of its lethal taint, rendering the dark powers of Chaos hers to consume, but requires the defilement of a legendary warrior’s resting place. Who better than Marbad, first of the Elector Counts, ancient hero to the fools of the Empire? The innumerable zealots who guard it are all that stand between the Countess of Sylvania and power beyond all imagining.	false
missions_localised_description_wh3_main_ie_qb_vmp_mannfred_von_carstein_armour_of_templehof	During his studies amongst the scrolls of skin in the ancient city of Lahmia, Count Mannfred uncovers several references to a suit of mail imbued with great power. In ages past, the armour’s original owner, a king of Nehekhara, fell in battle. Upon dragging the reluctant spirit of the dead Nehekharan king back to the surface, Mannfred learns that he was slain by a horde of Greenskins whose Warboss, Grudsnik, stripped his corpse of the magnificent armour. Mannfred’s scouts send word that Grudsnik’s mound lies to the east of Castle Carcassonne whose duke commands a powerful garrison. Doubtless this puny mortal will try to interfere with Mannfred's plans, but no matter, for his corpse will serve the Count as well as that of any other man.	false
missions_localised_description_wh3_main_ie_qb_vmp_mannfred_von_carstein_sword_of_unholy_power	Delving within the ancient flayed skin covers of a fell tome that had come into his possession, the Count discovers an examination of binding, funnelling Dark Magic into ancient physical artefacts. When a great quantity of spirit essence is released, it can be harnessed and bound into an item through the use of magical power. Mannfred knows of such a locus, an Arcane Fulcrum of bone deep in the Badlands, where Greenskins gather to conduct their pathetic shamanic rites. Even now, they gather in great numbers around the Pillar of Bone and their Shamans are engaged in one of their primitive rituals to their gods, Gork and Mork. Mannfred fingers his sword thoughtfully then calls to his Wight King captains to ready the army.	false
missions_localised_description_wh3_main_ie_qb_vmp_vlad_von_carstein_blood_drinker	Blood Drinker thirsts. The sword has lain dormant for centuries, and so the blade has dulled – its once-golden pommel tarnished. The sword must drink, must be bathed in blood – only then will its pommel brighten and blade shine again. The sword's one true owner, Vlad von Carstein, sees it is in a sorry state and begins a campaign to quench its thirst in the blood of Sigmar's sons. Shaken into action, mankind are mustering forces and preparing to face the Undead legions of Vlad's design. Vlad is pleased – they muster to fight in an army grand-enough to appease the Vampire Count's ego. His sword shall drink deeply from the mortals gathered!	false
missions_localised_description_wh3_main_ie_qb_vmp_vlad_von_carstein_the_carstein_ring	The Carstein Ring has returned its master to Unlife once more. However, the resurrection of Vlad, first of the Vampire Counts, has proved difficult. The power of the ring now fades, so Vlad must do something about it if he is to use its benighted abilities in future. For this, he will need Warpstone mined from a seam deep in the Desolation of Nagash. A chunk of Morrslieb fell from the sky and struck the area many years back, scattering the land with more than enough of the Chaos-infused rock for Vlad's needs. A lightning strike at the mine is the best approach – anyone foolish enough to stand in his way will be obliterated or inducted into his army's ranks...	false
missions_localised_description_wh3_main_ie_qb_wef_drycha_coeddil_unchained	Within Athel Loren, Drycha’s association with the vengeful Treeman Elder known as Coeddil is no secret. His great betrayal of the Asrai has not been forgotten, and the forests whisper that his wrath will never be subdued. He has roamed imprisoned in the Wildwood with his Dryad handmaidens for several centuries, while Drycha’s wargrove has determinedly carried out his malevolent decrees in the outside world. But the time of his liberation is finally at hand. Coeddil will have his freedom – Drycha needs only to topple two of the Waystones that form the fence around his forest prison, thus freeing the great Ancient once and for all!	false
missions_localised_description_wh3_main_ie_qb_wef_durthu_daiths_sword	The Glade Scouts of Athel Loren pitch themselves desperately against hordes of Undead, who rive and shift at them in seemingly endless waves. Durthu had suspected the hand of the Necromancer Heinrich Kemmler, but instead his nefarious student is behind the Undead horde. The damp and pallid hallmarks of Kemmler are all over his protégé's work as he advances on the forest with his desiccated horde in tow. The forest must be protected, and Durthu will give no quarter in its defence. Let these dark and twisted fiends feel the full wrath of the Deepwood, with the wrathful Ancient as its instrument of war!	false
missions_localised_description_wh3_main_ie_qb_wef_orion_the_cloak_of_isha	The Cloak of Isha, much revered relic of the goddess herself, has been stolen. The Elves speak of dark omens, and even Ariel herself feels the changing of the forest as surely as she feels the shifting of the season. Orion is incensed to find out that the relic is to be secretly given to the Cult of Pleasure in exchange for the Mark of Slaanesh. A Glade Lord, sworn to the defence of Athel Loren, plots against the forest and plans to usurp it! There is no time to waste, haste must be made to confront this errant and treacherous Lord before it is too late! The forest watches with fearful anticipation; the Night Glens seem to grow darker as the hour of battle approaches.	false
missions_localised_description_wh3_main_ie_qb_wef_orion_the_horn_of_the_wild	Dark news reaches the court of Athel Loren; shadows loom on the outskirts of the forest, and the Waystone fence is threatened. Reports reach the king that a herd of Beastmen slipped through the perimeter and defiled another Waystone before slinking back into the undergrowth. Orion and his scouts detect the foul and pestilent aura of Dark Magic at the site of the Beastman raid – an aura that could belong to only one Beastman that Orion knows of: Morghur. Rallying the Wood Elves to his side, he pushes onwards to find the enemy and sate his bloodlust. As the Elves edge forward, the path closes in around them and the moment of battle draws near...	false
missions_localised_description_wh3_main_ie_qb_wef_orion_the_spear_of_kurnous	Winter grows ever closer, and with it the time of Orion's return to the Oak of Ages and to renewal. Yet there are forces of darkness that would see this path curtailed all too quickly. Having infiltrated the Oak of Ages, Anath Raema – Goddess of the Savage Hunt – plans to supplant Ariel and ascend to an Athel Loren shaped by her malicious desires. Athel Loren is in uproar; fear sets in like a deep chill, which shatters into panic when a rebel force reveals itself, advancing on the Oak of Ages. Orion's final act must be to destroy this force and put Anath Raema's destructive desires to the sword once and for all.	false
missions_localised_description_wh3_main_ie_qb_wef_sisters_dragon	The enigmatic Sisters of Twilight are masters of the wild beasts, an advantage they use with frightening effect when fighting upon the loyal flying mounts which carry them through war-torn skies: Gwindalor, the wise and even-tempered Great Eagle and Ceithin-Har, the fearless and hot-blooded Forest Dragon. To Naestra’s concern and Arahan’s seething anger, Ceithin-Har had not responded to their latest calls – the Dark Elves had captured it, but were then ambushed by some Beastmen who took the Dragon for themselves. The sisters know of one obvious place to look for the Children of Chaos; in the nearby forest enclave of Witchwood Hollow, their scouts had spotted their foul Herdstones – the only reliable evidence of a Beastmen presence.	false
missions_localised_description_wh3_main_ie_tehenhauin_lord_kroak	After a considerable amount of searching high and low right across Lustria, Lord Kroak’s Skink scouts finally locate the overgrown temple-tomb in which the ancient Relic Priest is meditating, as ever, upon the fine details of the Great Plan. However, in their haste it would appear that the scouts were somewhat careless, as they have been followed to Kroak’s location by a force of those insidious ratmen, the Skaven! They plan to destroy him, once and for all, by incinerating his physical remains that anchor him to the world. This must not come to pass – defend Kroak from harm whilst his priests awaken him!	false

Vast congregations of the simple folk turn out to witness the blessings, the Supreme Patriarch's fiery rhetoric filling their hearts with a rekindled determination to protect the Motherland at all costs. But this increased defiance coupled with the remote and therefore sparsely-defended locations makes these ceremonies an attractive target for Kislev's enemies.\\n\\nIn a coastal village, north of Erengrad, the peasants listen to the words of the Supreme Patriarch as he harangues their weakness and ingratitude, urging them to set aside their own petty concerns and join his crusade against the spreading influence of the Dark Powers in the Tzarina's Ice Court. Out at sea, a storm gathers, the clouds rolling toward the shore. Under their cover, dark shapes move. The Dark Elves have come, eager to slaughter and fill their holds with slaves from amongst the seemingly helpless peasantry. Above even the rising thunder, the shrieking voice of the Supreme Patriarch calls the congregation to give up their lives in defence of the Motherland. These invaders will be thrown back into the waves from whence they came!	false
missions_localised_description_wh3_main_qb_nur_kugath_necrotic_missiles	Ku'gath's past dealings with the Dwarfs have not gone well. The diminutive cave-dwellers have an iron constitution which stubbornly resists Nurgle's blessings, in spite of the Plaguefather's endless experiments. What is needed is a large quantity of test subjects so that Ku'gath can divine what lies at the root of this resistance. Once this is isolated, he can formulate a new wave of plagues of such virulence that even the Dwarfs' senseless recalcitrance will crumble.	false
missions_localised_description_wh3_main_qb_ogr_greasus_overtyrants_crown	Greasus is determined to stamp his authority as Overtyrant on all of the Ogre Tribes. So when the most powerful Black Orc Warboss of the Mountains of Mourn launches a Waaagh! deep into Ogre territory, Goldtooth moves to bring him to battle on the slopes of the sacred Fire Mouth volcano. Once this usurper has been trodden into the dirt, then Greasus may wear his basin-sized crown with unassailable pride.	false
missions_localised_description_wh3_main_qb_ogr_skrag_cauldron_of_the_great_maw	As the Gore Harvester, Skrag is ever on the lookout for fresh meat for his cauldron. Long days spent wandering the under-caves taught the Prophet of the Great Maw to observe the Gorgers which haunt his every step, for their feral senses allow them to root out fresh quarry to satisfy their gnawing hunger. When the Gorger's nostrils flare and their famished eyes gleam red, Skrag knows that slaughter is close at hand, and he has learned to gauge the scale of the potential feast by the Gorgers' silent eagerness. On this day, the Gorgers have spent some time sniffing eagerly beyond the caverns, heading up out of the darkness and into the peaks with saliva stringing from their hideous teeth. Skrag's instinct is that they are on to something big and he follows them, determined that his cauldron will have the greatest share of the flesh glut.	false
missions_localised_description_wh3_main_qb_sla_nkari_witstealer_sword	During his onslaught against the descendants of Aenarion centuries ago, N'Kari was driven into the Sea of Dreams by the combined might of Tyrion and Teclis. In his headlong flight, he dropped his favoured Daemonic blade at the bottom of the ocean floor, and since that time he has plotted to retrieve it. Judging that the eyes of the High Elves are now elsewhere, N'Kari makes his move, but unbeknownst to him, Elven Mages set wards to scry the area and are alerted to his reappearance. As the Arch-tempter searches the seabed, he discovers an Elven host barring his path, protected from the tides by their accursed Mages.	false
missions_localised_description_wh3_main_qb_tze_kairos_staff_of_tomorrow	Kairos' contemplation of the Well of Eternity has given him an insight which bodes ill for his master's schemes. The Staff of Tomorrow cannot exist in multiple points across the weave of fate, it will create a paradox that could blind Kairos and hamper Tzeentch's plans for the Great Game. In the moment of comprehension of this fact, the Fateweaver's two heads turn to face each other, and as their eyes meet he is drawn into a plane of existence that is not the present, yet one which lies between past and future. He must defeat both his past and future selves in order to reconfigure events.	false

missions_localised_description_wh_dlc08_monster_hunt_0_stage_1	With the appearance of giant, winged monsters, Chaos Frost Dragons are thought to be a type of Chaos-mutated Dragon that dwells in the underground passageways of the Old World’s coldest climes. Amongst the northern tribes there are tales of one such monstrous specimen called Frigustrex, Scion of the Cold-Void, which has terrorised the tundra for centuries. Witnesses say that when coming out of hibernation it emerges from the ground, in a heartbeat, to indiscriminately devour any unknowing passers-by that get too close to its territory, located somewhere at the frozen, northern end of Troll Country.\\n\\nRecently, The Tower of Khrakk and the surrounding areas north of Troll Country have been inexplicably blanketed by freakishly bad snow storms. Word also reaches you that entire tribes have disappeared from the region without a trace, reportedly perishing in the extreme weather. This is highly unusual – it is not like the hardy Northmen to succumb to the freezing elements so easily. A more likely explanation is brought to you by a few survivors who managed to escape the storm – they say that it was not the icy weather that swallowed up their fellow tribesmen, but a giant, Dragonish shadow lurking in the blinding blizzard.\\n\\nIf there is even the slightest chance that the fabled Frigustrex is out of hibernation and on the prowl, then further investigation is warranted. This could end up being a bountiful hunt indeed!	false

The influence of Chaos only enhances their bestial aspects, making the already-monstrous beasts larger and even more terrifying than they already are. One such pair of one-eyed abominations of the Beastmen are the gargantuan Cygor brothers known to men as The Salzenmund Soul-Eaters. These grotesque leviathans are not only bigger, stronger, and faster than their ordinary counterparts, but are feared even by Beastmen Bray-Shamans due to their ability to dampen the use of magic for others in their presence. To take on the mighty Soul-Eaters with limited use of magic certainly makes for a challenging hunt, but one which will potentially culminate in an impressive sacrifice to the Gods.\\n\\nFirst you must find the pair of monsters, who are always found together; a surprisingly difficult task considering their immense size. Being of the Beastmen, the Soul-Eaters dwell deep in the dark forests, navigable via the vast network of Beastpaths known only to the Beastmen themselves.

missions_localised_description_wh_dlc08_monster_hunt_2_stage_1	Dragon Ogres are living legends of carnage and destruction. Most of what the Norscans know of these god-like beasts of Chaos is from the ancient records kept by their Shamans, which has immortalised them in folklore. Amongst the more ancient tribes there survives tales of one exceptionally strong Dragon Ogre Shaggoth known as Traygard Mountain-Cleaver. His power is thought to be second only to Kholek Suneater himself, with the ability to call upon thousands of thunder bolts to rain down on his victims, striking from unpredictable arcs to maim and destroy on his whim. Traygard is indeed an excellent target for a hunt – to sacrifice such a powerful and ancient monster of Chaos would be seen very favourably by the Gods. However, the monstrous Shaggoth hasn’t been seen in centuries, or at least, nobody has witnessed him and lived to tell the tale in that time. \\n\\nNews arrives of rumours that Traygard may be active again. A Norscan tribe to the north-east, very close to the Chaos Wastes, has been burnt to the ground with almost their entire enclave of warriors slaughtered in a single night. It is certainly true that many tribes of the north frequently perish at the hands of rival warring tribes, but on the night this tribe fell, it is said that a thunderstorm as bright as day lit up the night sky.\\n\\nThis is certainly worth investigation, but you first need more information, preferably from the survivors who actually witnessed the slaughter. With the majority of the tribe dead, this is easier said than done – the few surviving tribesmen are scattered as nomads throughout the region. The hunt is on.	false

However, when they take the form of Venom Queens, gigantic in size and made up for in numbers by their hatchling swarms, most would prefer not to face one. The only real upside of encountering a Venom Queen is that there are rarely more than one in any one place at a time – killing just one is hard enough!\\n\\nRecently, harrowing stories have started circulating that gigantic Venom Queens are grouping into vast spider swarms in the lands to the south.

You have also arrived at a time of conflict between the Dwarfs and the Greenskins, who are currently fighting a bitter subterranean war over the many underground strongholds protecting the lucrative mines in the area. You can hear the faint sound of cannons and warfare emanating from the ground beneath.\\n\\nYou have no interest in this silly war between the stunties and the grobi! Besides, the men and creatures of the north are not adept at digging and navigating tunnels, preferring to fight out in the open like real men. Fortunately, the Greenskins still have several camps on the surface where it should be possible to obtain more information about the Venom Queen infestation. There won't be time for diplomacy, however!	false
missions_localised_description_wh_dlc08_monster_hunt_3_stage_3	While sacking a Greenskin camp, you manage to capture a spineless Goblin attempting to scurry away from the area unseen. The cowardly wretch says he’ll give up some information about the Venom Queen infestation for a little ‘compensation’. But there are cheaper ways to get information out of a greedy Goblin! Taking a full three seconds of a beating before spitting out the information, he reveals that Skarsnik, the self-proclaimed ‘Warlord of Eight Peaks’ had recently discovered this group of larger, poisonous Arachnaroks, and had been trying to herd them for use in his own malevolent schemes. However, he could not control the uncontrollable swarm and it had moved on, thought to have gone underground via a nearby tunnel.\\n\\nYou need to find the location of this tunnel entrance. To do so, the area around Karak Eight Peaks will need to be turned upside down.	false
missions_localised_description_wh_dlc08_monster_hunt_3_stage_3_mpc	Recently, harrowing stories had started circulating that gigantic Venom Queens were grouping into vast spider swarms in the lands to the south. The most recent spate of appearances had been in the area around Karak Eight Peaks, where they had taken over swathes of land, devouring all who came near. Your spies tell you that this is undoubtedly the work of Skarsnik, the self-proclaimed ‘Warlord of Eight Peaks’, who had allegedly discovered the group of larger, poisonous Arachnaroks, and had been trying to herd them into the area for use in his own malevolent schemes.\\n\\nYou care not for some stupid Goblin’s ill-conceived plans, but the news of this bounty can only mean one thing to a Norscan hunter – a prime opportunity for a worthy sacrifice! To find the location of the giant spider cluster, the area around Karak Eight Peaks will need to be turned upside down to find their burrow.	false
missions_localised_description_wh_dlc08_monster_hunt_4_stage_1	The Greenskins are famous for having all manner of monstrosities in their despicable ranks, including the lumbering Giants that follow them to insatiably feast in battle. Killing one for sacrifice would bring great prestige and recognition from the Gods, for what can be more impressive than slaying a legendary descendant of the long-forgotten Sky-Titans?\\n\\nYou have heard of one very belligerent Giant called Blorgar the Mad Titan, who is lumbering around the Grey Mountains being more than just a minor nuisance to the locals there. Setting out to slay the leviathan, you expect that the locals having their lands indiscriminantly flattened will be quite happy to see you, but it matters little. You're not going there to kill it for their sake – the hunt is on!	false
missions_localised_description_wh_dlc08_monster_hunt_4_stage_1b	Arriving in the Grey Mountains you find out that Blorgar is long gone, but the destruction left in his wake is evident. Buildings have been smashed to rubble, crops flattened, and people reduced to ground-smears. Although the Giant's movements are still unknown, the locals tell you of a Bretonnian herb collector who might know where the brute lives. The Bretonnian had allegedly made a fleeting appearance in the Grey Mountains shortly before the Giant arrived, claiming that he’d accidentally stumbled upon the Giant's underground lair while spelunking nearby to gather some cave mushrooms. Knowing that the Giant was approaching, he was gone almost as soon as he’d arrived, fearful of the carnage to come.\\n\\nYou must now travel to Bretonnia to search for this herb collector. There would also be no harm in indulging in a bit of raiding while you’re there, if not just to keep the troops happy!	false
missions_localised_description_wh_dlc08_monster_hunt_4_stage_3_1	The Bretonnian herb collector has the information you need, but you don't trust the backstabbing gobbos to do any sort of financial deal. A spot of subterfuge, although perhaps cowardly from your perspective, may be needed instead in order for you to obtain the hostage. You must send one of your Heroes to infiltrate their camp and steal the Bretonnian right from under their noses.	false

Having heard of one very belligerent Giant called Blorgar the Mad Titan terrorising the Grey Mountains, you set out to slay the leviathan for a great sacrifice, for what can be more impressive than bringing down a legendary descendant of the long-forgotten Sky-Titans?\\n\\nOnce you’d arrived in the Grey Mountains, however, Blorgar was nowhere to be seen. The only chance of gaining any useful information of the Giant’s whereabouts lay with a Bretonnian herb collector who’d allegedly stumbled upon an underground lair while spelunking nearby. Unfortunately this Bretonnian had been taken hostage by some nasty Goblins on a recent raid. The importance of the information known to him is crucial to complete the hunt, so a Hero was sent into the gobbos' camp to steal him back.\\n\\nYour servant dumps the hog-tied Bretonnian herb collector at your feet, along with some loot he managed to steal on his way out.	false
missions_localised_description_wh_dlc08_monster_hunt_4_stage_3a	Your messengers tell you that the greedy Goblins are asking for a near-fortune to give the herb collector up. It seems they know he must have some considerable value to you. The thought of just killing them all crosses your mind, but then you would be running the risk of them fleeing, or executing the hostage. You need this man, and you need him alive, so you decide to raise the required funds.	false
missions_localised_description_wh_dlc08_monster_hunt_5_stage_1	Forest Dragons are truly remarkable creatures, dominating the forests as all dragons dominate their habitats. For most, stepping into the woods to find one to slay is either an act of extreme bravery or hopeless stupidity, such is the fiercely protective nature of the beings who dwell there. To some, the elusive Wood Elves are as dangerous as the unpredictable Beastmen, both of whom may attack unprovoked if you trespass into their woodland territories.\\n\\nSomewhere in the trees and thickets of Athel Loren lives Radixashen, also known as the Serpent of the World Roots. It is thought to be as ancient as the forest itself, and for that, it is a highly prized bounty for sacrifice. As with all dragons, it will be very difficult to track down and kill. The first thing you must do is to travel to the famous forest of the Wood Elves.	false
missions_localised_description_wh_dlc08_monster_hunt_5_stage_2	You have arrived at the forest and now must plan a way to draw the monster out of its hiding place. Knowing that there are often strong bonds between Forest Dragons and the Glade Lords of the Wood Elves, your next course of action seems clear. If you cause enough damage to the Wood Elves’ dwellings, their monstrous serpentine ally may show up to aid them. Even if it doesn’t, at least you will get the opportunity to pillage the dwellings of those estranged forest people!	false
missions_localised_description_wh_dlc08_monster_hunt_5_stage_3	It seems that Radixashen is not interested in coming to his ally's aid on this occasion. Perhaps it wrongly assumed that they were able enough to repel your attack, but in any case, further despoilment of the forest will be needed to bait the creature. You know that there is a great tree of immense spiritual importance to the forest, located right at its heart. Known as the Oak of Ages, not only is it considered the source of the forest’s power, but is also the annual birthplace of their King in the Woods. Surely, the Serpent of the World Roots cannot ignore the desecration of such a revered and important location. It is time to raise the raiding banners!	false

missions_localised_description_wh_dlc08_monster_hunt_6_stage_1	Mammoths are important tools of war for the northern tribes, and highly valued for sacrifice to the Dark Gods. Lately there have been sightings of some particularly impressive specimens around Norscan regions, rumoured to be members of a legendary herd of behemoths known as The Great Mawherd of Bloodfjord. This herd is thought to graze on the icy slopes of the Mountains of Hel. These beasts shall be a great offering indeed – go there and seek out this herd for a dark sacrifice!	false
missions_localised_description_wh_dlc08_monster_hunt_6_stage_2	Arriving in the mountains of Hel, the elephantine beasts are nowhere to be found. Instead, it seems that there are several Dwarf warriors to the area, namely Slayers and Rangers. Clearly, they too are hunting this herd, but you can’t be sure of their motives. The nearest Dwarfholds are in the nearby Gianthome Mountains – go there and squeeze some information out of them!	false
missions_localised_description_wh_dlc08_monster_hunt_6_stage_3	You have gathered information that a large Dwarf expedition has just departed to hunt down the herd. The Dwarfs’ involvement is an interesting development, since they are not known to be avid monster hunters, nor are they known to use mammoths in their battle-ranks as the northern tribes do. There must be good a reason for them to have left the safety of their holds just to hunt down some belligerent beasts. They were last seen marching for Kislev, so some further reconnaissance will be needed.	false

missions_localised_description_wh_dlc08_monster_hunt_7_stage_1	Soaring above the eldritch plains of Sylvania there exists a rare species of gargantuan bat-like monster that is as giant and powerful as the largest of Dragons. They are known as Terrorgheists, flying nocturnal beasts of rotten flesh and withered organs exposed to the night air. Although most are guided by the will of their evil masters, some Terrorgheists are more self-serving, drawing their power and evil intent from the very soil of their Undead homeland. It is said that to bring down such a beast takes the greatest of hunters. This sounds like just the kind of sacrifice that would be seen very favourably by the Gods!\\n\\nThere is one ancient Terrorgheist known to be more terrifying than all others, with a scream that is said to break the will of any man, and eyes like black holes that suck in all manner of magical energies and light. It is known as the Abyssal Shrieker, an abominable Terrorgheist spoken about only in nightmarish tales shrouded in myth, the fragments of truth of which are unknown to most.\\n\\nIt would certainly be foolish to enter into this hunt with no knowledge of the bounty, so before setting off to find the monster, you call upon one most likely to have knowledge of the Old World’s ancient beasts – a Shaman-Sorcerer.	false
missions_localised_description_wh_dlc08_monster_hunt_7_stage_2	Delving into his vast collection of tomes and scrolls, the Shaman reveals that any records which might have mentioned the Abyssal Shrieker were so ancient that they are lost in the streams of time. With no hint as to where the monster’s lair could be, its very existence is in question. At the very least the Shaman is able to tell you that he knows Terrorgheists to be deeply bound to necromancy in the Sylvanian lands, and one particular Sylvanian family is known to be frequently mentioned in some records as having hunted the terrible beasts in the past. It’s not much to go on, but it’s a start. You must search out any remnants of this family in the lands of Sylvania.	false
missions_localised_description_wh_dlc08_monster_hunt_7_stage_3	After a short stint of raiding around Sylvanian lands, you come across an old manor known to be the former home of the Sylvanian family you seek. The house is lifeless – the line of nobility that used to live there had long ended, leaving only howling ghosts of the past that scatter into the shadows as you arrive. Searching every room, you come across a study with an old skeleton sat at a desk, a quill still in its hand. On the table is a leather-bound notebook containing a written history of the family who once lived there.\\n\\nAccording to the notebook, the former inhabitants of the house were once nobles of nearby Stirland, which was frequently haunted by The Abyssal Shrieker. The skeleton sat at the table was, in fact, a former Stirlander Lord, a renowned hunter who had once attempted to kill the exceptionally dangerous centuries-old monster himself. After a vicious battle, the great Lord failed to slay the beast and narrowly escaped with his life. Although he survived the encounter, he paid a terrible price for his defeat. The Terrorgheist absorbed almost all of his life-force and strength to make itself even more powerful, leaving the once-great hunter a sickly, weak individual, an affliction that infected his entire family and bloodline. Withered and disgraced, the noble and his kin exiled themselves to Sylvania where they eventually perished in shame.\\n\\nClearly, this pathetic Stirlander was nowhere near as great a hunter as you! He at least managed to record the location of his defeat, which you assume to be in the vicinity of the Abyssal Shrieker’s lair. All that remains to do is travel to Wurtbad to find it.	false

It is thought to be a ‘generous’ spirit, always interested in the plight of its mortal followers. Now, however, even the Crow’s generosity has worn thin.

The allure of the Serpent is highly addictive to most, but you have infuriated it by resisting the lure of its pride, arrogance, and excess. Having observed you obliterate the other petty Gods’ champions with interest, the Serpent God simultaneously writhes in disgust at your shunning. Now it sends a challenger, as charismatic as all its champions…	false
missions_localised_description_wh_dlc08_qb_chs_final_battle_tzeentch	The inconstant Eagle God knows each trivial seed of hate in man’s heart, just as it knows the ultimate fate of every star in the cosmos.

This can be none other than the Scion of the Cold-Void itself! There is only one way to see this hunt through to its conclusion, and that is to follow the monster right into the eye of the storm. It is time to claim the legendary beast for the Gods!	false
missions_localised_description_wh_dlc08_qb_nor_monster_hunt_1	You reach the edge of the forest, having taken on dozens of captives on the way. These unfortunates will serve as living bait to lure the Soul-Eaters out, who will likely be accompanied by the vicious Beastman herd they march with. The hostages are chained up and hammered to stakes upside down by their ankles, deliberately drawing their blood. The beasts will surely catch the scent, and it will be hard for them to resist the lure of injured, defenceless prey.\\n\\nFrom a safe distance you watch the doomed hostages, as their screams echo between the trees. Out of nowhere, a frighteningly large tide of Beastmen suddenly emerges from the thickets, gorily devouring the victims, ripping them piece from piece, limb from torso. Then, almost as quickly as they’d appeared, they were gone. The scene of carnage and bloodshed is immediately surveyed and two pairs of hoof marks are found amongst the gored bodies, much larger than that of even the largest Cygors ever seen. Your bounty is here!\\n\\nYou give the order to march directly into the dark, uninviting wood, following the enormous tracks. The Forest of Shadows shall give up its prize – the Salzenmund Soul-Eaters will be yours to sacrifice!	false

The slave was speaking the truth – your scouts report back that the monstrous Traygard has been spotted not far from your location, and if you move immediately you can cut him off at the Cliff of Beasts. At last! Your search may soon be at an end, and the great hunt will finally begin in earnest.	false
missions_localised_description_wh_dlc08_qb_nor_monster_hunt_3	It did not take long for the location of the tunnel entrance to be discovered. There are multiple giant spider tracks leading into the subterranean passageway, making it easy to identify as the one you seek. Being cautious, you send scouts ahead to descend into the tunnel first, who return to tell you that the tunnel leads into an even bigger network of tunnels beneath. The spider tracks are as clear as day and the herd will be found, if only you follow them. All that remains is for you to lead your army down there…	false

missions_localised_description_wh_dlc08_qb_nor_monster_hunt_6	Your scouts inform you that the crazy Dwarfs are in fact hunting the herd to settle an old grudge – revenge for the Mawherd's trampling of one of their past throng leaders. Stranger still, while you have been on the trail of this mighty mammoth herd, you have not seen any actual traces of its presence anywhere. Large herds of such gargantuan beasts are known to indiscriminately trample anything that gets in their way while on their migration routes – vegetation, settlements, people – but you’ve observed limited evidence of such activity. With the Dwarf expedition now heading towards High Pass, it is time to go and witness The Great Mawherd of Bloodfjord for yourself, if indeed it is actually there!	false
missions_localised_description_wh_dlc08_qb_nor_monster_hunt_7	The scale of the battle fought between the Stirlander Lord and the Abyssal Shrieker must have been immense. At the location of the hunter’s defeat you find swathes of land that once contained villages and vegetation that had been flattened in a massive skirmish, with the ancient remains of people and animals caught up in encounter strewn across the land. Following a trail of bones, you find the Terrorgheist’s lair in a nearby haunted forest – an obvious location for the dwelling of such an evil creature.

Many Dawi set their beards alight to rid themselves of the parasitic embuggerence or covered their beards in acrid powder, which had the unfortunate side effect of bleaching said facial hair a drastic blonde colour!

But it turns out that the kruti Knights, while gladly escorting the damsels back to safety, left the fair Dwarf maids to fend for themselves with sorry excuses about there not being enough room on the backs of their nags.

Such an atrocity is a grudge that can never be truly settled. Go and slay Greenskins to salve this open wound!	false
