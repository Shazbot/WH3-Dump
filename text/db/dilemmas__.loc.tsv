dilemmas_localised_description_wh2_dlc08_nor_confederate_generic	{{CcoCampaignEventDilemma:CharacterTargetName}}, leader of the {{CcoCampaignEventDilemma:FirstTargetFactionNameWithIcon}} tribe has been defeated; a once powerful warlord now reduced to obscurity beneath your might. For as you stand tall in victory he kneels at your side, hands in chains, his followers stood amongst yours, brought to a halt in anticipation of your next utterance. His men now see him as weak and unfit to lead any longer, this is a chance for you to take control of this faction's forces and land, as well as its followers' dubious loyalty.\\n\\nThough, while the allure of land may appear to make this choice a simple one, do not let the challenges that a larger empire creates escape you - perhaps simply killing this man and letting whatever is left of his faction fade into memory may be a more fitting end...	false
dilemmas_localised_description_wh2_dlc08_nor_confederate_generic_no_execution	The leader of {{CcoCampaignEventDilemma:FirstTargetFactionNameWithIcon}}, {{CcoCampaignEventDilemma:CharacterTargetName}}, has been defeated. His followers look on in horror, their unwavering belief in their leader dashed in an instant, even this legend cannot deny your supremecy amongst all Norscans now. Surely now is the time to seize control, bring his domain into yours, take all that was once his. Or, you may free him... as an insult perhaps, an unending torment for this foe - the choice is yours.	false

dilemmas_localised_description_wh2_dlc09_great_vortex_tmb_arkhan_the_tomb_blade_of_arkhan_stage_2	There is little left of this city's past splendour. Its crumbling edifices and dilapidated porticos are host to naught now but the desert winds. The agent scours the ruins, and eventually locates the entrance to a grand tomb, with Alcadizaar's name barely legible over the grand architrave. In front of the tomb lie the bodies of Lizardmen, entangled with mouldering remains. The blood and ichor is still wet: this skirmish was recent. Perhaps the battle still rages within? Should the agent enter the tomb and risk becoming a combatant? Or remain circumspect and tarry without for a sign?	false
dilemmas_localised_description_wh2_dlc09_great_vortex_tmb_settra_the_crown_of_nehekhara_stage_3	The raid was a success. A barbarian chief, draped in ancient gold and gem-studded trinkets, is dragged before Settra. He is larger by far than the average human and wears a growling mask of surliness, but Settra revels in the terror that lurks behind his eyes. The creature's soul is forfeit, of course; Phakth demands eternal justice, and Settra his due. What will be the manner of this insect's passing?	false

dilemmas_localised_description_wh2_dlc09_tmb_dilemma_almighty_monuments	A new monument will show the gods that their veneration is still our foremost concern. They, in turn, will strengthen our hands in this time of endless war. But to whom among our pantheon should it be dedicated?	false
dilemmas_localised_description_wh2_dlc09_tmb_dilemma_crumbling_buildings	In cities as old as the deserts it is the natural order that even the finest buildings eventually crumble and fall.

However, not everyone is a suitable candidate for such work. Who can we spare?	false
dilemmas_localised_description_wh2_dlc09_tmb_dilemma_glorious_structures	The cities of Nehekhara are without compare in their scale and grandeur. However, time ravages stone just the same as flesh and now our buildings are badly in need of restoration. Upon which of them should we focus our endeavours?	false
dilemmas_localised_description_wh2_dlc09_tmb_dilemma_liche_priest	Liche Priests should live only to serve their king's undying will. Betrayal should be anathema to their order, yet one among their number has betrayed us by conspiring with a rival Tomb King. How should we proceed?	false
dilemmas_localised_description_wh2_dlc09_tmb_dilemma_lost_tombs	During the excavation of one of our Lord's tombs, a disaster occurred; the more we dug, the more sand poured into the breach, trapping our unfortunate workers inside and re-sealing the chamber. Is the loss of a few wretched labourers sufficient reason to dig elsewhere? Or should we persevere here and redouble our efforts?	false
dilemmas_localised_description_wh2_dlc09_tmb_dilemma_scaly_sacrifice	Whilst traversing the jungles on the edge of the world, with a view to bringing them within our sphere of influence, our forces have encountered a village of tribal Lizardmen.

dilemmas_localised_description_wh2_dlc09_tmb_dilemma_sinking_pyramid	Despite the best efforts of our chief Necrotect, one of our tombs has started to sink back into the sand once more, before giving up its illustrious, arcane secrets; if we do not act quickly to shore up its entrance, we risk losing everything we have thus far gained.	false
dilemmas_localised_description_wh2_dlc09_tmb_dilemma_soulless_sphinx	One of our Liche Priests has dared approach with concerns that one of the Necrosphinxes is no longer under the control of our warriors' souls but instead is in thrall to Usekph, the destructive god buried beneath the sands.

dilemmas_localised_description_wh2_dlc09_tmb_dilemma_the_banisher	We have made a great discovery! During the course of our excavations, remains of the army that once served Alcadizaar the Conqueror, the last and maybe the greatest of all the Priest Kings of Nehekhara, have been unearthed. It would take but a little magic to raise them to our service, should we do so or give them a ritual burial in the classical Nehekharan style?	false

dilemmas_localised_description_wh2_dlc10_monster_hunt_10_stage_2	Dargoth is in the aftermath of some attack. The towers still burn even amongst the snow and ice, and the bodies of the recently-mauled litter the ground. The survivors look upon the Norse with suspicion and hostility. It is clear your force does not come to offer aid. You speak out, asking if this was the work of the immortal War Hydra. You get only silence in response...	false

dilemmas_localised_description_wh2_dlc10_qb_nor_monster_hunt_8_stage_2	This scheming Druchii trader has been surprisingly forthcoming thus far, but as you suspect, it is not long before he proposes a bargain. He is willing to hand over the extinguished Phoenix pinion, stating that it will prove useful on the hunt to come, and provide the location of the volcano in which the Mother of the Flame is reborn into this world.\\n\\nHowever, there is a cost; he has need of a favour regarding an unrelated matter. He wishes to divert you from your hunt - only temporarily - to kill one of his enemies. He claims he has bad credit with the assassins of his own race, so requires the murderous skills of your men. Once the death is certified he will hand over the pinion and the information you need to continue the hunt.	false
dilemmas_localised_description_wh2_dlc10_sword_of_khaine_lv1	You wield the power of Khaine's might. The sword strikes terror in all your enemies. On the battlefield you reap a mighty toll as foes fall before the blade with ease. Yet, nightmares torment your soul, and a sickness leeches into your lands... \\n\\nPerhaps it is wiser to relinquish such power? You will be weaker... feebler... but is it not a price worth paying to becalm your dreams?	false
dilemmas_localised_description_wh2_dlc10_sword_of_khaine_lv2	Is the sword now controlling your decisions? Your power is absolute - a force to match the gods themselves - but your moods are permanently dark, your allies lose confidence, and your followers surely plot regicide. You reign over hollow lands and a desperate folk who now despise their sovereign!\\n\\nWill you give up this power to rule the world?	false
dilemmas_localised_description_wh2_dlc10_sword_of_khaine_lv3	Through battle, the sword grows ever stronger, while at home your lands fester and become more corrupted with the passing of time. You must choose whether to continue down this darkest of paths…	false
dilemmas_localised_description_wh2_dlc10_sword_of_khaine_pick_or_not	The Sword of Khaine will always be drawn to the powerful. You have defeated its most recent owner, and even as their body cools, the sword calls to you – the power of a god bound within the blade waiting to be unleashed!	false
dilemmas_localised_description_wh2_dlc11_cst_cylostra_the_bordeleaux_flabellum_stage_4	A self-obsessed singer needs a doting audience, and Cylostra is well aware that it is the Bretonnians who appreciate her talents the most. After all, it was a Bretonnian king who once favoured her above all other court singers, frequently inviting the diva to give private performances and serenade eminent guests at important stately banquets.\\n\\nOn the other hand, Cylostra is technically still well overdue for a high-profile performance before the High Elves of Ulthuan. Many years ago, when the Lamprey succumbed to a storm in the Eastern Straits of the Great Ocean, before Cylostra’s transformation, she was on an important diplomatic voyage to sing before the Phoenix King. A treaty of great import was reliant on his pleasure in her performance, for the Elves believe good art – music in particular – to be as valuable as gems and gold. It was an important engagement, so surely the High Elves will still be waiting for her?!\\n\\nTo find an audience, Cylostra could head east from the islands of Northern Yvresse towards Bretonnia, retracing the fateful voyage which led to her transforming into the eternally-vengeful spirit she has become. Alternatively, she could head towards the southern end of the Shifting Isles, where the High Elves' Old World shipping lanes are located, following them directly into the great Elven port of Lothern and, hopefully, to the Phoenix King himself...	false
dilemmas_localised_description_wh2_dlc11_cst_dilemma_ancient_treasure	Although most entrepreneurial, our endeavours 'ave presented something of a dilemma. A large, jewel-adorned statue of sandstone has... found its way into our possession. It's far too large to take away 'ole, but its adornments would make quite the prize! It's also covered in glyphs indicating woe might befall any who mistreat it, but that's probably just flannel so less tenacious pirates leave it alone. Should we ignore the markings an' loot its jewels or be wary?	false
dilemmas_localised_description_wh2_dlc11_cst_dilemma_camp_fortune	Ahoy there! We've come across an enemy encampment devoid of life an' littered with corpses. Half-devoured bodies are scattered about the clearing. The fallen dead were elite riflemen - surely one among 'em will be of use to us? Or perhaps we should seek out the creature that caused this massacre?	false
dilemmas_localised_description_wh2_dlc11_cst_dilemma_great_golden_idol	Apparently, a great Lizardmen temple 'as been unearthed. Though most of it is dilapidated, a single statue stands at the centre of what was likely a ceremonial garden - it must be worth a fortune, but removing it will certainly cause the temple to collapse, which will surely draw somebody's ire. Should we take the idol an' ignore the consequences or be cautious not to attract too much attention - an' their cold, unforgiving bloodlust, our way?	false
dilemmas_localised_description_wh2_dlc11_cst_dilemma_great_naval_battle	A major naval battle has ended, leavin' hundreds dead on each side. Death is no barrier to continued service, as well you know - those who fell in battle would make fine new recruits. If we make haste and 'ead off at full sail, the perished could be reanimated before they're lost to the ocean. We must decide if this boon is worth the toll it would take on our crew - should we make haste or ignore the battle?	false
dilemmas_localised_description_wh2_dlc11_cst_dilemma_grim_tidings	The tides seem uneasy an' force us off course. Could this be a warning from Manann? This would not be the first time he has guided us out of danger - should we continue our course or take heed?	false
dilemmas_localised_description_wh2_dlc11_cst_dilemma_ocean_of_opportunities	'Conversations' with several captured admirals 'ave brought information to light regarding several potential targets. We'll only 'ave time to strike one, however, so must choose wisely. Which convoy should we attack?	false
dilemmas_localised_description_wh2_dlc11_cst_dilemma_pirate_haven	A rival band o'pirates 'ave requested access to some of our coves an' are willing for pay for it. Should we allow 'em to shelter in our territory or kill 'em and 'liberate' the loot they're currently carrying?	false
dilemmas_localised_description_wh2_dlc11_cst_dilemma_plan_of_action	The night sky bleeds purple! The Wind of Shyish is strong, instilling the crew with new found vigour an' strength. Now is the time for action - for conquest - an' for using this magical boon to our advantage. Should we control the seas or turn our attention to new lands? 	false
dilemmas_localised_description_wh2_dlc11_cst_dilemma_rotten_wood	The harsh weather has caused severe damage to our timber reserves, makin' it difficult to repair any combat-damaged ships at sea.

dilemmas_localised_description_wh2_dlc11_cst_dilemma_shipping_ledger	We've acquired a ledger covering much of the recently-raided area, filled with useful information 'bout shippin' routes an' cargo inventories.

dilemmas_localised_description_wh2_dlc11_cst_dilemma_shyish_wanes	Those purple Winds of Magic are strangely absent 'round these parts, makin' the bindings that tie our troops to this world an' our will tenuous at best! Should we wait for the winds to blow more favourably for us or press on regardless?	false
dilemmas_localised_description_wh2_dlc11_cst_dilemma_supplies_adrift	The sight of wrecked ships is nothing new for a seasoned pirate, but this particular one 'eralds a welcome surprise! Packed to the keel with brand new weapons, armour an' gunpowder, this ship's cargo hold is several times the size of our own. However, some supplies will 'ave to be left behind. What should we loot from the ship?	false
dilemmas_localised_description_wh2_dlc11_dilemma_neo_encounter_at_sea_1_a	The remains of a large sea beast are spotted floating in some nearby backwaters. The unidentified creature has been inexplicably ripped to pieces by an explosive force, its belly torn open and exposed. This mysterious find could prove bountiful, for who knows what devoured treasures might reside within its guts? An unidentified ship has also been spotted nearby – rival scavengers. Whoever they are, you are not one to share salvage with anyone!	false
dilemmas_localised_description_wh2_dlc11_dilemma_neo_encounter_at_sea_1_b	Your ocean scouts bring news that the bloated corpse of a massive sea monster has floated to the surface in some nearby straits. Although its carcass swells dangerously with noxious gases, you know that the belly of such a gargantuan monster can potentially yield numerous valuable treasures. A salvage mission may be a risky endeavour, however, as it is likely that other salvagers have also caught wind of the opportunity.	false
dilemmas_localised_description_wh2_dlc11_dilemma_neo_encounter_at_sea_1_c	With a gush of putrid water, the bloated corpse of an ancient sea leviathan surfaces close by. You consider sending your crew to investigate what secrets the cadaver of the sea beast will bestow, but such an expedition is not without risk. When alive, these creatures are known to host parasites the size of wolves and even colonies of needle-toothed aquatic man-things. Even so, there may be valuables to be found within its stinking gut.	false
dilemmas_localised_description_wh2_dlc11_dilemma_neo_encounter_at_sea_2_a	A convoy of trading ships carrying myriad precious goods across a nearby sea trade route have been brought low by the angry Sea-God, Stromfels, much to the chagrin of wealthy merchants and investors back at their homeports. Knowing that such a wreckage could be a highly profitable salvage opportunity, you sail towards the area but unsurprisingly, others have also caught wind of it. You could continue your approach, but this might end in a confrontation at sea…	false
dilemmas_localised_description_wh2_dlc11_dilemma_neo_encounter_at_sea_2_b	The seabed is littered with the barnacle-clad hulls of ships that once set out to tame the oceans. Recently, rumours started circulating that one particularly notable wreckage had been spotted – a partially sunken ship that was rumoured to have been sailing back to Marienburg with a hold full of mysterious trinkets looted from across the Old World before suffering Stromfels’ ire. You know its location, but there’s always the chance that others have caught wind of these rumours too…	false
dilemmas_localised_description_wh2_dlc11_dilemma_neo_encounter_at_sea_2_c	From the crow's nest come shouts that broken masts can be seen piercing the ocean's surface. The lookout has spotted a sunken ship lying in the waters amongst some distant shoals. Located far from an inhabited shoreline or any known sailing routes, it has the markings of a pirate galleon. A mysterious sunken pirate ship in this location cannot be here without good reason, and perhaps that reason involves treasure!	false
dilemmas_localised_description_wh2_dlc11_dilemma_neo_encounter_at_sea_3_a	You receive word of a wooden carcass of a ship that has been discovered strewn across a small, mysterious island. You are told that beyond the beach, gold and other trinkets can be found in abundance, surrounded by the long-dead crewmen who starved whilst waiting to be rescued. Some of your own crew whisper of curses which may be worth heeding, but such things rarely deter you when looted wealth and riches are involved…	false
dilemmas_localised_description_wh2_dlc11_dilemma_neo_encounter_at_sea_3_b	While on an ocean crossing, an island inexplicably rises out of the sea before you. As your fleet approaches, the crew hear an eerie but ensnaring song that carries over the turbulent surf; a tune that promises much, with lyrics singing of everything from the untold riches of Greasus Goldtooth to some of Nagash's secrets of Undeath. The verses foretell the attainment of great power and wealth - all you must do is order your vessel closer to shore… It is what the Syreens want…	false
dilemmas_localised_description_wh2_dlc11_dilemma_neo_encounter_at_sea_3_c	As you make your way across the sea, the ocean mists suddenly part to reveal an island which, by all accounts, is unchartered even by the Great Mapwright himself. High spars of rock jut from sea, like spikes in a trap that has ensnared some prey. Indeed, a wrecked ship lies impaled on the small island's coastline; its crew seem to have moved into the interior along with any valuables that may have been onboard.	false
dilemmas_localised_description_wh2_dlc11_dilemma_neo_encounter_at_sea_4_a	Pirate coves are some of the world’s most elusive places, where the wealth of local sea brigands is secretly kept and fiercely defended. It seems that today may be your lucky day, as your lookout in the crow’s nest claims to have spotted one – a small island cave, next to which a black ship is moored. The ship belongs to an infamous fleet of Vampire pirates, and it appears that there are Zombie Deckhands transferring treasure chests onto the ship right now. It’s an opportunity for a big payday, but these Unliving sea-dogs certainly won’t give up their wealth too easily.	false

It has prime military importance as it is home to both the Colleges of Magic and the Reiksguard Headquarters.

Their Elector Count, Alberich Haupt-Anderssen, has approached you with an offer of confederation.\\n\\nHistorically, Stirland had the ignominy of sharing terrain with the realm of the Vampires in its easternmost areas.

dilemmas_localised_description_wh2_dlc13_emp_elector_politics_1	At a recent congregation of the Elector Counts there is a lengthy discussion about the separation of the religious cults from matters of Imperial policy. There is much polarisation in the group on what is a highly-charged issue – eventually, an argument breaks out between the Electors of {{CcoCampaignEventDilemma:FirstTargetFactionNameWithIcon}} and {{CcoCampaignEventDilemma:SecondTargetFactionNameWithIcon}} who are on opposite sides of the argument, with both looking to you to lend your voice to their argument.\\n\\nYou have said little about your thoughts on the subject until now – you feel little will come of this debate, but a leader of your standing cannot be seen to sit on the fence on matters of great import such as this.	false
dilemmas_localised_description_wh2_dlc13_emp_elector_politics_10	On your advice and the promise of financial returns, {{CcoCampaignEventDilemma:CharacterTargetName}} of {{CcoCampaignEventDilemma:FirstTargetFactionNameWithIcon}} had joined you in what appeared to be a surefire investment in some merchant warehouses in Marienburg. On paper, you both stood to make prolific returns. Unfortunately, it turned out that the warehouses were inadvertently built directly above a giant rat nest – though it was not entirely clear from your business associates in Marienburg whether it was the rats or the nest that were giant. In the end, the entire site had to be levelled by a special demolition team brought in from Nuln.\\n\\nElector {{CcoCampaignEventDilemma:CharacterTargetName}} of {{CcoCampaignEventDilemma:FirstTargetFactionName}} is demanding a return on his investment, or at the very least his money back.	false
dilemmas_localised_description_wh2_dlc13_emp_elector_politics_11	Your state troops had recently been participating in joint military drills with their counterparts in {{CcoCampaignEventDilemma:FirstTargetFactionNameWithIcon}}. Attending were some of the more junior members of your personal retinue; fresh-faced recruits hand-picked for their warrior prowess but still young and impressionable men. During a night of rest and recuperation in {{CcoCampaignEventDilemma:FirstTargetFactionName}}’s capital, the men caused a drunken brawl that soon escalated into a minor riot. By dawn the next day the damage had spread across large portions of the city and included the desecration of some state monuments.\\n\\nThe behaviour of your men has caused  {{CcoCampaignEventDilemma:FirstTargetFactionName}} to look upon you extremely unfavourably. Dishing out harsh punishments may not be enough – it may take considerable resources to salvage things here.	false
dilemmas_localised_description_wh2_dlc13_emp_elector_politics_12	You find out that a cargo ship containing treasure rightfully belonging to you – plundered by your very own men from the temple-cities of Lustria – had recently arrived in Marienburg. The cargo ship was not of your state, however; its crew had claimed the plunder as salvage after your own prized transport galleon shipwrecked on some unchartered rocky islets out in the Great Ocean.\\n\\nYou send your retinue to Marienburg to forcibly claim what you consider to be rightfully yours, which will at least cover the cost of your lost galleon. Upon arriving, however, they discover the cargo ship containing your treasure belongs to {{CcoCampaignEventDilemma:FirstTargetFactionNameWithIcon}}.	false
dilemmas_localised_description_wh2_dlc13_emp_elector_politics_13	You are approached by your sharpest political advisor, who has formulated a plan to increase your standing amongst the other Electors. It will involve considerable politicking from you, however, and a great deal of time spent with each and every one of the heads of the other states.	false
dilemmas_localised_description_wh2_dlc13_emp_elector_politics_14	One of your top advisors has suggested a way to increase your political standing within the Empire. Though you do not command all military activities in faraway lands personally, it is possible to have each state’s annals updated to attribute past military victories to your own involvement and frame yourself as an inspirational military leader. To achieve this you must contact your most trusted officials in each state and pull a lot of clandestine political strings – no small feat, but the fruits of such labour could be highly beneficial to you in the long run.	false
dilemmas_localised_description_wh2_dlc13_emp_elector_politics_15	There are few better ways to attain political standing than getting the common man on your side. One possible way of doing this is a grand tour of the states, in which you schedule a cavalcade to travel from capital to capital, where you will address the masses on any and all matters that might concern them. Needless to say, organising such a tour would involve calling in a lot of favours and pulling a lot of strings to achieve.	false
dilemmas_localised_description_wh2_dlc13_emp_elector_politics_16	In the Empire, political power is often connected to economic prosperity. There is perhaps no group or organisation that has a greater effect on economic prosperity across state borders than the Merchant’s Guild, the rumours being that many of the Electors themselves are on their payroll.\\n\\nUsing your gravitas, it may be possible for you to arrange 'favours' for the patrons of the Merchant’s Guild – such as loosened regulations or tax cuts, in addition to more personal furtherances – in return for their help in advancing your political standing, all at considerable cost of course.	false
dilemmas_localised_description_wh2_dlc13_emp_elector_politics_17	Ancient stone circles have been discovered in your state, remnants of the 'Old Faith', which in a prior age may have involved a primitive form of nature worship and blood sacrifices. There is evidence of recent activity at these sites, indicating there are those who still practice the dead religion.\\n\\nThe discovery of the monoliths and their recent use is angering the recognised Cults of the Empire, who always seek to subvert any elder meaning, dismissing it as backward, regressive, and a distraction from the true religions. In the modern day, the cults have considerable political gravitas within the Empire, so their opinion should perhaps not be overlooked. What action will you take?	false
dilemmas_localised_description_wh2_dlc13_emp_elector_politics_18	The Elector Counts have started discussions about new decrees that will reduce the amount of power they wield as a group across the whole Empire, while also increasing the autonomy of each of their states. It is essentially a step towards political decentralisation, with those who oppose the planned decrees even going as far as saying that it may be the beginning of the end of the great union of the Empire.\\n\\nPutting your political efforts into preventing the decrees may be the best thing to do for the Empire, but you must be tactful in how you proceed with addressing such a highly-charged and important issue.	false
dilemmas_localised_description_wh2_dlc13_emp_elector_politics_19	You have caught wind of vicious rumours being spread about you, accusing you of being a secret worshipper of Chaos. There is no indication as to the source of these lies, which of course have absolutely no grounds in reality and are clearly political in their motivations. Though these accusations are both baseless and outrageous, your reputation is already tarnished, since many believe there is no smoke without fire.\\n\\nShould you decide to take action, it will certainly take much time and effort to reverse the damage that these lies have done to your reputation.	false

dilemmas_localised_description_wh2_dlc13_emp_elector_politics_20	It has come to the attention of another Elector that you were a target of bribery many years ago, having taken a vast payment from the Merchant Guild early in your tenure. In return, you lobbied against tightened regulations on their businesses, and were not the only head of state to ever have done so.\\n\\nThe Elector has proof of your acceptance of the Merchant Guild's gold. Although a minor blot on your past, he is threatening to reveal the evidence to the other Electors unless you give him considerable compensation. It may be ancient history, but the information will surely cause the other Electors to question your character and place amongst their number.	false
dilemmas_localised_description_wh2_dlc13_emp_elector_politics_3	The Council of States is an important group of advisors that grew from the demands of running the Empire day-to-day - there are far too many for one man or woman to keep track of. Prominent family members or nobles of each state are frequently appointed as consultants on matters of Imperial law, finance, diplomacy and military matters, amongst other things.\\n\\nA seat on the council has become available and the states of {{CcoCampaignEventDilemma:FirstTargetFactionNameWithIcon}} and {{CcoCampaignEventDilemma:SecondTargetFactionNameWithIcon}} have both put forward candidates to fill it. It is certain that your endorsement of one of them will tip the balance one way or the other, informing the final decision.	false

Elector Count {{CcoCampaignEventDilemma:CharacterTargetName}} of {{CcoCampaignEventDilemma:FirstTargetFactionNameWithIcon}} had illicitly secured a large loan of unaccounted gold, secretly withdrawn from the state treasury of {{CcoCampaignEventDilemma:SecondTargetFactionNameWithIcon}}. Though there was a ‘gentleman’s agreement’ to pay back the loan over a reasonable timeline, {{CcoCampaignEventDilemma:SecondTargetFactionName}} has now decided to call in the entire debt without warning or reason, demanding it be paid back in full immediately.\\n\\nThe two states have asked you to secretly help arbitrate this dispute without bringing it to attention of the other Electors. What action will you take?	false
dilemmas_localised_description_wh2_dlc13_emp_elector_politics_5	A rash of highway banditry across the Empire has resulted in the introduction of new decrees to tighten security measures on all merchant routes that cross state borders. With new highway curfews, tougher patrols, and more frequent spot-checks, the increased restrictions on movement are strangling some states' businesses more than others.\\n\\nSeveral merchants in {{CcoCampaignEventDilemma:FirstTargetFactionNameWithIcon}} have recently gone out of business due to the new regulations, leading to fewer marketplaces and steadily-increasing poverty. It is in your power to pull a few strings and exclude the {{CcoCampaignEventDilemma:FirstTargetFactionName}} merchants from the new decrees, should you see fit to do so…	false

Such a seedy discovery would be an immense source of shame for both {{CcoCampaignEventDilemma:CharacterTargetName}} and indeed the entire state of {{CcoCampaignEventDilemma:FirstTargetFactionNameWithIcon}}.\\n\\nUsing your less-than-savoury connections, you could offer your help to {{CcoCampaignEventDilemma:CharacterTargetName}} in ‘silencing’ this harlot, which would certainly go a long way to increasing {{CcoCampaignEventDilemma:FirstTargetFactionName}}’s support for you.	false
dilemmas_localised_description_wh2_dlc13_emp_elector_politics_7	It has come to light that {{CcoCampaignEventDilemma:CharacterTargetName}} of {{CcoCampaignEventDilemma:FirstTargetFactionNameWithIcon}} has discovered an insurrectionist plot against him by a powerful rival noble in his state. He wants Imperial assistance in quashing the plot, but fears his claims will not be acted upon without the backing of another Elector.\\n\\nUsing your political clout, you could offer your support to {{CcoCampaignEventDilemma:FirstTargetFactionName}} to get them the backing needed to investigate the plot fully and bring those responsible to justice.	false
dilemmas_localised_description_wh2_dlc13_emp_elector_politics_8	An over-zealous Witch Hunter has reportedly been terrorising the people of {{CcoCampaignEventDilemma:FirstTargetFactionNameWithIcon}}, executing dozens of citizens based on barely-substantiated evidence. Entire villages have been burned to the ground by this grim agent, who proclaims to be on an fully-sanctioned mission to proactively flush out all suspected followers of the Dark Gods in the state. Upon investigation, you manage to confirm with your connections in the Cult of Sigmar that this individual is indeed a state-issued Templar, albeit an extremely fanatical one.\\n\\nIt could be in your interest to help {{CcoCampaignEventDilemma:FirstTargetFactionName}} out of their woes by getting the Witch Hunter decommissioned.

It is a grand gesture for a head of state to extend such an invite to another, so naturally you accept.\\n\\nOn the day of the Wurstfest you are called away to lead an army against a minor uprising.

dilemmas_localised_description_wh2_dlc15_hef_grom_invasion_offer	When his dander is sufficiently up, and his vitriol is at its most vitriolic, Grom can be tempted to attack early; this is best done only when there's enough confidence in Yvresse's ability to withstand an attack, however.\\n\\n[[col:red]]Fighting Grom now will initiate the Final Siege of Tor Yvresse and cannot be reversed.

dilemmas_localised_description_wh2_dlc15_hef_imrik_confederation_caledor	Your allies in Caledor are ready to move and re-assert your control. But they report a problem. The opposing houses, though pathetically incompetent in matters of war, have proven to be adept politicians, purchasing friends and allies across Ulthuan with luxurious gifts. Cracking down on the miscreants could result in a dangerous backlash against you.\\n\\nGalling as it may be, you could seek to counter their influence by expending your own. Or you could allow the noble faction to remain in control, for now, and seek to restore order via other means.\\n\\n	false

dilemmas_localised_description_wh2_dlc16_dilemma_wef_encounter_athel_loren_bretonnians	Bretonnian forces have been spotted venturing into the edges of the forest. They are pilgrims, seeking to present an ancient relic at a chapel lost within the woods.\\n\\nThis relic does indeed have power, and could aid the healing of the Worldroots. You could let them leave their offerings – and claim them for yourself as soon as they have left – but the forest spirits are enraged at this incursion and demand a response in force!	false
dilemmas_localised_description_wh2_dlc16_dilemma_wef_encounter_athel_loren_dwarfs	Some Dwarf miners have accidentally uncovered a tendril of the Worldroots. Dwarfs, though stubborn, recognise that wrongs must be righted, and have sent an envoy. They offer compensation, and even suggest that they use their runic magics to build a seal that will protect the Worldroot.\\n\\nThe Tree Spirits are suspicious – they say that Dwarfen blood will be seal enough!	false
dilemmas_localised_description_wh2_dlc16_dilemma_wef_encounter_athel_loren_greenskins	Orcs are a frequent nuisance on Athel Loren's mountainous Eastern border. Your spies have spotted a warband entering the forest.\\n\\nThis band, however, is a rag-tag affair. They could easily be misled into leaving the forest without a fight. But the Tree Spirits want blood...	false
dilemmas_localised_description_wh2_dlc16_dilemma_wef_encounter_athel_loren_tree_spirits	A group of rebellious Tree Spirits has slain some Elves. They are willing to accept banishment to the Wildwood as punishment, but this lenience may encourage further discontent. Alternatively, you can make an example of the Tree Spirits, but they will no doubt fight back!	false
dilemmas_localised_description_wh2_dlc16_dilemma_wef_encounter_gaean_vale_druchii_v_moulder	The Skaven cannot tunnel onto Ulthuan, but they are devious and adaptable creatures. Clan Moulder has paid a force of Druchii Corsairs to ferry a small brood of mutant beasts onto the shores of Nagarythe. The Moulder beasts now head to gnaw at the roots of Gaean Vale while Corsairs pillage the Elven settlements.\\n\\nThe local Shadow Warriors of Nagarythe would be strong enough to hunt down the beasts – if they were not distracted by the pirates. Eliminating the Corsairs would be challenging, but would both end the Moulder threat and buy the favour of the Shadow King.	false
dilemmas_localised_description_wh2_dlc16_dilemma_wef_encounter_gaean_vale_high_elves	Though you have rescued Gaean Vale from the Chaos hordes, your continued control of the region has angered some of Ulthuan's denizens. The Elves gather outside the Vale, demanding you return it to the Everqueen.	false
dilemmas_localised_description_wh2_dlc16_dilemma_wef_encounter_gryphon_wood_vampires	A Strigoi Ghoul King, along with his cannibalistic retinue, have been spotted in the forest. Though monstrous in form, their tale is pitiful – persecuted by their brethren, they are fleeing in search of sanctuary, so it does not seem that they intend to stay long in the forest. By observing them from a distance, you could show your forces that they have nothing to fear from these wretches, or you could punish them for their desecration, as the forest spirits would no doubt insist!	false
dilemmas_localised_description_wh2_dlc16_dilemma_wef_encounter_heart_of_the_jungle_bowmen_v_dinosaurs	Though Oreon himself has long-disappeared, the mercenary band he led into the jungles of the Southlands endures. But in their time away they have become wild and feral, and are reluctant to follow your lead.\\n\\nTheir mercenary instincts endure, however. A substantial sum of gold might persuade them to join you. Alternatively, you could call out one of his captains to face you here. A defeat would chasten them sufficiently to join your cause.	false
dilemmas_localised_description_wh2_dlc16_dilemma_wef_encounter_heart_of_the_jungle_tomb_kings	The Tomb Kings of Nehekhara are arrogant beyond belief, and declare that we should pay them tribute. A token payment might be enough, but many feel this is demeaning. The forest spirits say that their bones will make for fine fertiliser!	false
dilemmas_localised_description_wh2_dlc16_dilemma_wef_encounter_jungles_of_chian	Demons rampage through the sacred jungles, summoned by a Tzeentchian cult for undoubtedly malevolent purposes. This cannot be allowed to stand — the damage they could do would be irreparable! Yet, many worry that the military effort it would take to repel them may prove too dangerous for our people.\\n\\nEither way, a decision must be made for the sake of these hallowed grounds.	false
dilemmas_localised_description_wh2_dlc16_dilemma_wef_encounter_laurelorn_empire	The Elves of Laurelorn frequently trade with humans of Middenland.\\n\\nSome of these traders have attempted to defraud the Elves. The courts of men are unwilling to help – maybe violence could solve the problem, however...	false
dilemmas_localised_description_wh2_dlc16_dilemma_wef_encounter_laurelorn_norsca	A call for aid from the Elves of Laurelorn: a force of Norscan raiders has penetrated deep into Empire lands. Normally such a raid would focus on the armies of men, but this group brings with them a cabal of Fimir – creatures of the mists and fog who may be able to penetrate the Forest's borders.\\n\\nThe Fimir often stray from the main group to perform profane rituals – a targeted attack them at this point would end this threat to the forest. Alternatively, you could attack the main Norscan force and perhaps gain the favour of the Empire.	false
dilemmas_localised_description_wh2_dlc16_dilemma_wef_encounter_lustria_lizardmen	The forest is approached by an unusual force – an enormous group of Zoats, accompanied by a guard of Lizardmen. The Skink says that the Great Plan insists these Zoats are the rightful inhabitants of the forest, and must be allowed to tend to it at your side. However, the forest spirits are reluctant to share power with the Zoats, whose true intentions are unknown – they urge that you slay them all!	false
dilemmas_localised_description_wh2_dlc16_dilemma_wef_encounter_naggarond_dark_elves	Morathi has long had a rivalry with Ariel. The Hag Sorceress has sent an agent to stimy the growth of the Worldroots here, and seeks to bargain. If you share with her some secrets of the forest magic, she will cease her interference, and even offer you a glimpse of her own power. The Tree Spirits insist you spurn her advances, and water the forest with the blood of her agents!	false
dilemmas_localised_description_wh2_dlc16_dilemma_wef_encounter_sacred_pools_pestilens	Many years ago, the Skaven of Clan Pestilens swarmed these pools. At the instigation of Clan Moulder, they have returned. A vast army of Plague Monks, backed by a swarm of chittering rats, threatens to descend and sully the sacred waters. But an unusual source of aid appears: a Vampire pirate, looking to test some new artillery, is willing to direct his guns at the Skaven – for a price, of course.\\n\\nHowever, if you do not hire the pirate, he might instead choose to offer his arms to the Skaven..	false
dilemmas_localised_description_wh2_dlc16_dilemma_wef_encounter_special_the_blood_fane	Deep within the Forest of Shadows lies the Blood Fane, a huge pile of skulls dedicated to Khorne.\\n\\nThis monstrous altar is guarded by a single warrior, whose duty it is to add further skulls to the pile. Slaying its guardian would be a trivial matter, but another would no doubt come to take his place. You could take the time to purge this shrine – but who knows what horrors this might draw from the forest's depths...	false
dilemmas_localised_description_wh2_dlc16_dilemma_wef_encounter_the_haunted_forest	Our revered forest has been disturbed by a band of marauding Ogres. As great as their appetites are, it's impossible to say whether they hunger for treasure or warm, fresh meat for their cook pots. Some hope they might be appeased with gold, to keep our people from becoming part of an Elven stew.\\n\\nAngrier voices argue that their blood must water the earth, to heal the land and rid the forest of their stench! 	false
dilemmas_localised_description_wh2_dlc16_dilemma_wef_encounter_vale_of_webs_spiders	The Vale of Webs is home to enormous spiders. They are a part of the natural ecosystem, but have an irritating tendency to attract Greenskin spider-cultists. You could exploit this to your advantage by channeling the magic generated by the Greenskin spider-shamans, and even send them false visions from their spider-gods to manipulate them. However, unsurprisingly, the Tree Spirits instead want to see the Greenskins purged!	false
dilemmas_localised_description_wh2_dlc16_dilemma_wef_encounter_witchwood_greenskins_v_druchii	The Orcs that lurk the mountain passes of Naggarond are not natives – they are escaped slaves who have fled the mines and gladiatorial pits of the Druchii. One such band of escapees has set up camp near your borders, and is readying itself for a final stand against the Druchii slavers who pursue them.\\n\\nSlaying the Orcs might buy you the favour of the Druchii, as well as a sizeable reward, but if the Greenskins were to be victorious over their pursuers, then other slaves within the Dark Elves' domain might be emboldened.	false
dilemmas_localised_description_wh2_dlc16_skv_throt_final_battle_dilemma	With the destruction of her precious Waystones, Ariel grows increasingly desperate and could be tempted to begin her ritual early, thus rendering her vulnerable to attack; this is best done only when you are sufficiently confident that your foul ranks will be strong enough to overcome her bodyguards, who will defend her to the last.\\n\\n[[col:red]]Provoking Ariel to begin her ritual now will initiate the final battle and cannot be reversed. Losing the battle will end the campaign.[[/col]]	false
dilemmas_localised_description_wh2_dlc16_wef_confederation_dilemma_argwylon	Your forays against the Dwarfs have been met with Durthu’s approval. Despite the past assistance your kind have given the unrelentingly stubborn mountain-dwellers, they were never going to see the error of their ways in retaining their petty grudges against Athel Loren, so had to be taught a lesson.\\n\\nThe Elder Ancient is now open to joining you in a confederation. Alternatively, you can leave him to tend to Glade and he will channel its energies to aid you.	false
dilemmas_localised_description_wh2_dlc16_wef_confederation_dilemma_bowmen_of_oreon	Ilfrun, the leader of Bowmen of Oreon, is humbled by the defeat you have dealt him. Convening with you in the wake of your skirmish, he tells you his band lost their way after their leader, Oreon himself, lost his eye in battle, along with his vitality and sanity. His ensuing madness led him to desert his warriors, and subsequently he had not been seen or heard from in many years.\\n\\nThe Bowmen of Oreon are now open to joining you in a confederation. Alternatively, you can leave them to tend their Glade and they will channel its energies to aid you.	false
dilemmas_localised_description_wh2_dlc16_wef_confederation_dilemma_drycha	It was never your desire to stoke civil war and internal strife amongst the stewards of the forest, but repeatedly bringing the Elves to battle and defeating them has gained Drycha’s attention.\\n\\nThe capricious Tree Spirit is now open to forming a confederation for the good of the Weave. Alternatively, you can leave her in charge of her Glade and she will channel its energies to aid you.	false
dilemmas_localised_description_wh2_dlc16_wef_confederation_dilemma_laurelorn	The Elves of Laurelorn have heard of your exploits against the Northmen and are grateful that the marauders' incursions into the lands surrounding their forests have subsided as a result.\\n\\nA fleet-footed messenger has approached from Laurelorn Forest to inform you that they are open to forming a confederation. Alternatively, you can leave them in stewardship over their Glade and they will channel its energies to aid you.	false
dilemmas_localised_description_wh2_dlc16_wef_confederation_dilemma_sisters	Naestra and Arahan, the Sisters of Twilight, have heard of your exploits against the Skaven, and that the ratmen’s assaults upon the Worldroots have subsided, making them much safer to traverse.\\n\\nThe Sisters send word that they are open to forming a confederation with you. Alternatively, you can leave them in stewardship over their Glade and they will channel its energies to aid you.	false
dilemmas_localised_description_wh2_dlc16_wef_confederation_dilemma_talsyn	Orion has heard of your exploits and is impressed by your show of strength. He sends word that he is open to joining you in a confederation. Alternatively, you can leave him to continue overseeing his Glade and he will channel its energies to aid you.	false
dilemmas_localised_description_wh2_dlc16_wef_confederation_dilemma_torgovann	Your attacks upon the Bretonnians have showed them who the dominant power is in the region. Throughout the Land of Chivalry, from Duke down to peasant, the reputation of the fey folk garners even more fear and respect than ever before. Lord Daith may be blind, but his lack of vision has not stilled his tongue, and it is no secret that he approves of your actions.\\n\\nTorgovann is now open to joining you in a confederation. Alternatively, you can leave Lord Daith to tend his Glade and he will channel its energies to aid you.	false
dilemmas_localised_description_wh2_dlc16_wef_confederation_dilemma_wydrioth	It was all too easy to deviate the attentions of the simple-minded Greenskins away from Athel Loren. As soon as you went to war against one mob, word quickly spread from Warlord to Warlord that the fey were venturing out of the forest in search of Orc and Goblin blood. As is their instinct, they turned their attentions to finding you, though the stupid brutes would obviously never get very far in that respect.\\n\\nLord Findol of Wydrioth is pleased with your actions and sends word that he is open to forming a confederation with you. Alternatively, you could leave him in charge of his Glade and he will channel its energies to aid you.	false
dilemmas_localised_description_wh2_dlc16_wef_drycha_ancient_bark	As the wargrove trudges through the forest you encounter a weary looking bristlecone pine tree growing amongst a sparsely populated grove, clearly of great age. At first you dismiss it as inanimate and almost dead, but as you pass by it suddenly speaks to you in a deep, booming voice. Though clearly still alive, the Treeman reveals himself to be a long-lost Elder Ancient of incredible age who has chosen this spot to relinquish his sentience and rejoin the forest permanently. Before he does so, he wishes to impart some of his wisdom to you, sensing your affiliation with the Elder Coeddil. But what knowledge will you seek from him?	false
dilemmas_localised_description_wh2_dlc16_wef_drycha_asari_awaits	A stranger of the Asrai tentatively approaches the wargrove. Before you can follow your instincts and immediately impale him with your sharpest branch-limb, he earnestly reveals he is a messenger sent from a nearby conclave of Wood Elves. He speaks of many great threats to their woodlands and how by working together they can be overcome for the good of all forests and the Tree Spirits within. What say you?	false
dilemmas_localised_description_wh2_dlc16_wef_drycha_bewitchment_enrichment	The spell that holds the Elves under the wargrove’s control is not as strong as it once was, but recently the Winds have been blowing unusually strong overhead. The Branchwraiths sense it, informing you that now is an opportunistic moment to harness the magical eddies to reinforce the Glamouring enchantment being used on your Elf units, at least temporarily. However, it can also be siphoned to invigorate the Elf souls that inhabit the wargrove’s Tree Kin, which would also be invaluable for the coming struggles. Which course of action will you take?	false
dilemmas_localised_description_wh2_dlc16_wef_drycha_corrupted_river	The soil beneath the wargrove’s buttresses emits a Ruinous stench! A nearby waterway had recently become saturated with the taint of Chaos being emitted by a source upstream, unknown in nature but worryingly powerful. The taint is now beginning to seep into the woodlands around the stream – something must be done lest Chaos permanently affects the land in worse ways than simply rendering it infertile. It is possible to magically dredge the stream of the Chaos taint which will keep it cleansed for a time. On the other hand, you also know certain aspects of dark sorcery learnt over your lifetime, and this could be an opportunity to harness the power of Chaos to redirect it at your enemies. What action will you take?	false
dilemmas_localised_description_wh2_dlc16_wef_drycha_different_green	A large horde of Orcs and Forest Goblins is rampaging through some nearby woodlands! Though it initially appeared there was no specific reason for them to have amassed in such numbers, your spies in the forest tell you the brutes are pursuing a contingent of Empire men. These men are known to you: they are a convoy of woodsmen, known despoilers of forests who you have yet to wreak revenge on for their transgressions. But the Greenskins' threat to the forest also cannot be ignored. Forest Goblins are known to wantonly strip woodlands of trees upon which certain species of fungi grow, which they use for their foul spider-taming rituals. Worse still, if the dung piles left behind by the Orcs were to seep into the ground it could render the earth infertile. Who should the wargrove target?	false
dilemmas_localised_description_wh2_dlc16_wef_drycha_hidden_lake	You have come across an enchanted lake deep within the forest. Pure and untainted, it is seemingly blessed by an unknown source of powerful magic. As you approach it, a bright light emanates from the beneath the water and a voice speaks to you in a familiar tongue. Whatever this spirit of the lake is, it requests that you not only leave the area immediately, but also that you thicken the thickets and copses around the lake so that it will not be found by others again. The Tree Spirits of the wargrove could be envigored should their roots be slaked by these magical waters, but if you decide to do as the lake spirit says there may be rewards…	false
dilemmas_localised_description_wh2_dlc16_wef_drycha_inferno	Whether by arson or natural causes, a flash fire suddenly rages through the forest! You can stem the fire’s advance but there is no time to save everything – you must choose what you wish to preserve.	false
dilemmas_localised_description_wh2_dlc16_wef_drycha_wood_defilers	As it has always been since their primitive, parasitic kind first started building their cities and polluting the lands with their presence, men of the Empire encroach upon the forest from all sides. As they tear the trees from the land and brazenly plough fertile soil that would otherwise be home to our beloved saplings, you hear the pain of the insentient flora cry out to you. In seeking vengeance, the wargrove has snatched some of these Empire men alive and they are dragged before you, screaming and terrified for their lives – just as it should be. What will you do with them?	false
dilemmas_localised_description_wh2_dlc17_dwf_thorek_confederation_karak_azul	King Kazador has made his intentions clear, reaching out to you in the hope that the vast resources of Karak Azul might be united with the strength of your expedition force. As the wretched Greenskins and Skaven close in, there is no doubt that he misses the input of his Master Runelord and sorely desires your counsel!	false

dilemmas_localised_description_wh2_main_def_names_of_power_ar_1_sacrifice	Death Night looms over the Druchii.

Those most valuable to you would make the best sacrifices - your sister, or your closest guard. Choose; who is to die on this fateful night?	false
dilemmas_localised_description_wh2_main_def_names_of_power_ar_2_caravan	Whilst travelling a dangerous and treacherous road, your entourage is set upon by a horde of Beastmen.

dilemmas_localised_description_wh2_main_def_names_of_power_ar_3_battle	A would-be usurper struggles in vain against your army. As his force falls around him, he stands resolute and delivers a challenge. Fight him, face to face, like a true warrior. Has he earned that right? 	false
dilemmas_localised_description_wh2_main_def_names_of_power_ar_4_beast	On the march, you are assaulted by a feral Manticore! It howls, singling you out for combat. How to react - attempt to slay the savage beast or try to tame it?	false

dilemmas_localised_description_wh2_main_def_names_of_power_ar_6_raid	Whilst raiding, your fleet spots a small, relatively-undefended coastal village; an attractive target.

dilemmas_localised_description_wh2_main_dilemma_treasure_hunt_spider_nest	Beneath the ruins lie a series of caverns; as you explore, you begin to notice an increasing number of large cobwebs.

Knowing that such places often contain the owner's treasures in life, you prise open its door. Inside, it is - somewhat oddly - bare, except for a large sarcophagus and an unidentified artefact, half-buried in the dirt.	false
dilemmas_localised_description_wh2_main_dilemma_treasure_hunt_trapped_survivor	As you search through the remains of a collapsed colonnade, cries for help echo through the rubble - people are trapped beneath! Although their welfare is of little interest, they may be of some use. Do you order that the area be cleared and the survivors freed, leave them to die beneath the fallen masonry, or perhaps pursue another course of action?	false
dilemmas_localised_description_wh2_main_dilemma_treasure_hunt_trapped_vault	In the tunnels below the city you find an undisturbed vault, its walls covered in Dwarfen runes. During your search you accidentally set off a hidden mechanism and before you can react, the doors slam shut behind you.	false

dilemmas_localised_description_wh2_main_hef_intrigue_court_of_the_sea	Representatives from the coastal kingdom of Cothique come before the court. Cothique Elves are hardy and weathered by the sea; they care little for the machinations of court, and so other, more 'refined' Elves gossip and giggle, not-quite out of sight. Yet the Cothiquian request is just, and their presentation courteous enough. How to deal with these other, disrespectful courtiers?	false
dilemmas_localised_description_wh2_main_hef_intrigue_favour_of_the_phoenix	The courtiers align themselves before the court, all vying for royal attention and favour. Sycophantic, but necessary. The Everqueen cares not for such pandering, and so the dispensation of favour falls to the Phoenix King. The mages of Caledor, the horsemasters of Ellyrion, and the stalwart defenders of Cothique all prostrate themselves before him and he asks you whom he should favour.	false
dilemmas_localised_description_wh2_main_hef_intrigue_in_fighting	A dispute has developed between the nobles of Saphery and Yvresse, whom the Sapherian Elves call the 'ghosts of glory'. Although the petty, clandestine squabbles of lower houses are never usually a concern for the Phoenix King, the Sapherian Elves bristle with magical power, whilst Tor Yvresse is one of the most defensible, if dangerously ill-garrisoned, cities in Ulthuan. Harmony between these two houses is preferable but, if not possible, then someone, somewhere must be appeased.	false
dilemmas_localised_description_wh2_main_hef_intrigue_life_in_the_lagoon	Courtiers are often expected to spend large stretches of time at court, living and operating under the suffocating political intrigue of Lothern. The messengers of the Phoenix King are able to weave throughout the lodgings of the courtiers, disseminating information that helps or hinders them. Likewise, the king can make life comfortable for certain courtiers, or extremely unpleasant. All is at his whim...	false
dilemmas_localised_description_wh2_main_hef_intrigue_retainer_of_power	The seneschal of the court controls the flow of information to and from the Phoenix King; he is, therefore, an important figure with great power. It is discovered that the seneschal has been choosing which information reaches the court, in order to maintain his power and reduce that of others. It is a shrewd tactic, but courtiers are only as smart as the secrets they hide. Once exposed, they are powerless.	false
dilemmas_localised_description_wh2_main_hef_intrigue_signed_sealed_delivered	It has been discovered that the Keeper of the Seal, who controls the officiating of all documents with the mark of Lothern, has been abusing his position, using the seal on menial, personal documents to enhance his power and prestige. Exposing him would condemn the man, but perhaps there are ways this can be worked to the king's advantage...?	false
dilemmas_localised_description_wh2_main_hef_intrigue_the_caledor_question	Whenever the envoys of Caledor are at court, fractious are the proceedings. They refuse to dip their flags to the Phoenix King, choosing instead to reference Caledor the Conqueror, who they say earned them the right to do as they please. Their arrogance is astounding, their insubordination infuriating, yet the Order of Vaul hail from Caledor, and their magical skills must never be underestimated, nor their loyalty imperilled.	false
dilemmas_localised_description_wh2_main_hef_intrigue_the_court_of_many_kings	Every realm of Ulthuan sends nobles and representatives to the court of Lothern. Every realm is a kingdom in itself, and their leaders kings. They approach Lothern with such a mentality; how the Phoenix King treats these egos is vital to the development and stability of all of Ulthuan.	false
dilemmas_localised_description_wh2_main_hef_intrigue_the_folly_of_youth	A young prince, impetuous and unknowing of the ways of court, has flown in the face of the order of precedence, speaking out against his elders publicly. Naturally, scandal has ensued. The Phoenix King is not required to wade into the hierarchical scuffles of the court, yet this prince shows promise - it would be unfortunate if he fell from grace due to his naive impropriety...	false
dilemmas_localised_description_wh2_main_hef_intrigue_the_hunt_and_the_hunter	The Phoenix King entertains the court to a great hunt, taken amongst the forests of Avelorn. The Elves of Chrace naturally excel at the sport, yet they are widely derided by the others for their prowess; the Master of the Hunt finds them especially odious. As one particularly mighty beast dives from the foliage, everyone lets loose their arrows. The beast is dead, a messenger reports, but it is uncertain who landed the killing blow. What do you recommend the Phoenix King tells them?	false
dilemmas_localised_description_wh2_main_hef_intrigue_the_would_be_suitor	A noble prince of Ellyrion presents himself before the court, offering the courtship of his eldest, and certainly most beautiful, daughter. It is not forbidden for the Phoenix King, once married to the Everqueen, to take additional consorts, yet to do so would send an interesting message - one that could not be easily undone. All the same, it is clear this prince wishes to curry favour, yet the entire court observes the action of the Phoenix King; what he chooses to do may have repercussions.	false
dilemmas_localised_description_wh2_main_hef_intrigue_they_who_whisper	High Elves at court partake in many manipulations to achieve their ends. A common tool is to employ lesser Elves and servants as go-betweens; whispering little birds carrying messages. This is not unexpected, but when one of these messengers is intercepted or revealed, there can be no choice but to excoriate them, to save oneself. Having one such messenger revealed, how do you advise the Phoenix King responds?	false
dilemmas_localised_description_wh2_main_hef_intrigue_wed_to_etiquette	The Phoenix King and Everqueen have received an invitation to the wedding of a court Noble. The king does not care much for them, but it would be impolite to not attend. Attending, however, requires that he bring a lavish gift for them. Whispers say that the engaged noble fancies himself a scholar, with a penchant for arcane and magical tomes. This would endear the Phoenix King to the betrothed-to-be, but there are perhaps other gifts that other guests would consider more impressive...	false
dilemmas_localised_description_wh2_main_hef_intrigue_whispers_of_the_mourning_chorus	One of the princes of Tiranoc has perished whilst hunting. He was a forthright and well-liked fellow, yet known for his streaks of arrogance and foolhardiness. His death is a terrible loss to the Tiranoc nobility, who hold themselves rigid with the starch of past glory. The Phoenix King and Everqueen are, of course, invited to attend the burial rites, yet how they participate is discussed with much fervour amongst the court.	false
dilemmas_localised_description_wh2_main_hef_intrigue_you_can_dance	At a great masque to celebrate Vaul, the Maker, the floor is cleared so that the Phoenix King and Everqueen may dance together.

All eyes are watching, even those of the Everqueen.	false
dilemmas_localised_description_wh2_main_lzd_a_deadly_price	The mystical Slann Mage-Priests have devised a new ritual to increase the speed and agility of your mighty Saurus warriors on the battlefield. However, such advances always come at a price; some of those who fall may rise corrupted, and the Unliving are an abomination in the eyes of Old Ones.	false
dilemmas_localised_description_wh2_main_lzd_a_tainted_bounty	The delving of your industrious Skinks brings to light an ancient metal ore: could this substance have been brought to the world by the Old Ones themselves? When subjected to your advanced weaponsmithing process the ore makes highly-effective arrowheads and javelin points. However, once you start to use them some of your usually-hardy Saurus warriors fall ill, raising questions over its safety and even whether it was planted deliberately by the enemies of the Great Plan. Will you continue to use it?	false
dilemmas_localised_description_wh2_main_lzd_ancient_skills	Whilst studying some newly-recovered ancient plaques, your Skinks have rediscovered long-lost building techniques that will enable the construction of high pyramids and mighty ziggurats, the likes of which have not been seen within Lustrian temple-cities for ages past. Generally, such constructions rise slowly. Will you employ these new techniques or not?	false
dilemmas_localised_description_wh2_main_lzd_blood_sacrifice	Relations with a nearby settlement have deteriorated; their interpretation of the Great Plan may be at odds with the Old Ones' intentions. Your Slann Mage-Priests inform you of a new ritual to recharge the Geomantic Web, but the price is a sacrifice. Will you raid for captives and sacrifice them or leave your neighbours be, as time may yet prove your vision correct?	false
dilemmas_localised_description_wh2_main_lzd_born_killers	This latest spawning of Saurus warriors appear to be far more belligerent than any you remember in recent times. Ferocity and resolve are called for when combating the foe, but your forces must also consider the Great Plan's higher purpose and not sacrifice themselves unduly. Will you embrace their vicious nature, or order retraining for a more balanced army?	false
dilemmas_localised_description_wh2_main_lzd_charging_in	The fervour of your great Saurus warriors to combat agents of the Ancient Enemy is admirable, though it is starting to verge on fanaticism in some divisions, risking mistakes that could allow Chaos a greater purchase on Lustria's sacred jungles and temple-cities. Is such recklessness in keeping with the Great Plan or should the Slann Lord Mage-Priests instruct their underlings to instil caution in the ranks?	false
dilemmas_localised_description_wh2_main_lzd_knowledge_regained	The discovery of an ancient plaque has revealed lost knowledge which may increase the magical effectiveness of the great Slann Mage-Priests - not by much, but even a small Geomantic advantage may contribute to the advancement of the Great Plan. However, such things are expensive to research and so must be carefully considered. Will you commit your precious resources in furtherance of the Old Ones' designs, or is such a minimal gain not worth the cost?	false
dilemmas_localised_description_wh2_main_lzd_magic_for_blades	The mystical Slann Mage-Priests have devised a new ritual to increase the effectiveness of the blades wielded by your Saurus warriors on the battlefield. However, such advances always come at a price; the ritual will siphon much-needed power from the Geomantic Web, potentially putting the Great Plan under threat. Will you use it or not? 	false
dilemmas_localised_description_wh2_main_lzd_new_blood	The signs are clear. The eternal war once again swerves in Lustria's direction; those that threaten to unmake the progress of the Great Plan gain power and prominence. Their designs must be countered. Do you wish to swell the warriors' ranks or bring forth a Saurus Hero to coldly annihilate the foe by fair means or foul?	false
dilemmas_localised_description_wh2_main_lzd_one_shot	Your Slann Mage-Priests' researches reveal the whereabouts of a distant but accessible plaque recording a ritual, usable once, which will powerfully defend your greatest Saurus Scar-Veteran against agents of the Ancient Enemy. Is it worth sending an expedition especially to retrieve this one-off advantage?	false
dilemmas_localised_description_wh2_main_lzd_out_or_in	Word comes of a new Norscan incursion; those foul servants of the Ancient Enemy, who revel in barbarism, have gained a foothold in Lustria and must be cast out! Their small coastal encampment could be easily eradicated, but many of your number are about to leave in search of a plaque of paramount import. As such, will you commit your forces to destroy the warmbloods or recover the relic and learn of the Old Ones' sacred intentions?	false
dilemmas_localised_description_wh2_main_lzd_reclaiming_the_lost_world	Your noble Slann Mage-Priests have devised a ritual that will give even ordinary Skinks increased immunity against some of the foul diseases lingering in territories overrun by the vile servants of the Great Horned Rat. However, they must still be defended against other threats in the abandoned temple-cities. Ground could be regained this way, though troops would have to be committed in the Skinks' defence.	false
dilemmas_localised_description_wh2_main_lzd_seal_or_strike	Scouts have located a minor branch of the Druchii's Black Way emerging deep in your territory. Allowing allies of the Ancient Enemy so near your heartlands is unacceptable - the spread of Ruinous corruption cannot be allowed and risks the cornerstones of the Great Plan for all time! Should you close this potential enemy conduit or use it yourself, to harry the Dark Elves all the way back to Naggaroth?	false
dilemmas_localised_description_wh2_main_lzd_skilled_forces	Rumours reach you of forces loyal to your Ancient Enemy, the Ruinous Ones, obtaining a vile, corrupted foothold on Lustrian soil. However, you have recently instituted a new spawning programme, resulting many new Lizardmen of the wrong caste. Will you send your depleted armies out or institute a fresh spawning of deadly Saurus Warriors?	false
dilemmas_localised_description_wh2_main_lzd_slann_selection	Enacting the powerful Rite of Awakening enables you to rouse one of the slumbering Slann from their restful contemplation. Nine Mage-Priests are known to you, each the master of a different magical lore. Which Slann will you choose?	false
dilemmas_localised_description_wh2_main_lzd_the_greater_good	Skinks have uncovered a fell lode that has the stench of Clan Pestilens about it. Plague strikes down all who go near it; many useful artisan Skinks have already been lost, and more are at risk. Quarantine would stop this malady in its foul tracks and frustrate the designs of the insidious Plaguelords, but the trapped artisans would be lost to the Great Plan for now. Alternatively, you could evacuate your Skinks to safety, a course which keeps their numbers high but risks the pestilence spreading elsewhere.	false
dilemmas_localised_description_wh2_main_lzd_war_babies	Recent spawnings have favoured the artisan Skinks over the Saurus warrior-caste. Indeed, workers are important to the Great Plan, but the world is threatened from within also and must be defended. You must be prepared for whatever foul ploy the vile servants of the Ancient Enemy or the Great Horned Rat may unleash next!	false
dilemmas_localised_description_wh2_main_lzd_ways_and_means	The priests of Sotek, ever mindful of the need to press the Serpent God's cause on the field of battle, are uneasy at certain technological developments you believe to be part of the Great Plan; they counsel a more martial focus if the Old Ones' designs are to be realised and the Ancient Enemy kept at bay. Will you overrule their objections or hear their reasons?	false
dilemmas_localised_description_wh2_main_lzd_which_hero	The Great Plan must be brought to fruition; as many Skinks as possible must be spawned and set to work if the Old Ones' sacred goals are to be achieved.

He is clearly weak – spurn his offering and declare your intention to claim the city, and no doubt its denizens would rally to you.	false
dilemmas_localised_description_wh2_twa03_dilemma_rakarth_rite	There are several aspiring Beastmasters within your entourage who wish to emulate your advanced mastery and empathy with the wild and feral. Though they may only dream of reaching the level of the Beastlord’s craft, it does not stop them from clamouring to do your bidding in the hope of garnering your knowledge and favour.

dilemmas_localised_description_wh3_dlc21_wef_confederation_dilemma_shanlin	Entrenched in the impenetrable depths of the humid Cathayan jungles far from the Oak of Ages, the Spirits of Shanlin are more elusive and isolationist in their outlook than any other of the forest’s protectors in this world. Nevertheless, the news of your victory against the Dragon Emperor’s forces has drawn them out of their hidden groves, though only via an emissary: a glamoured Wood Elf messenger.\\n\\nThe Spirits of Shanlin are open to forming a confederation with you. Alternatively, you can leave them in stewardship over their Glade and they will channel its energies to aid you.	false

Now the relic they guarded is ours to use as we see fit.\\n\\nOur Daemonsmiths could corrupt it for the Great Drill of Hashut, powering its descent into the core of the earth.

Snatched from under the pathetic Dawi's noses, this ancient relic of their warrior-god belongs now to the Dawi-Zharr.

If we wanted to twist the knife a little further, we could parade the relic through Zharr-Naggrund, a shining symbol of our superiority! However, if corrupted by our Daemonsmiths and used to power the Great Drill, the Blood of Hashut would be ever nearer our grasp...	false
dilemmas_localised_description_wh3_dlc23_chd_dilemma_best_trade_deal	A wealthy Chaos Dwarf wearing a golden hat (yes, really) comes to us, offering, so he claims, one of the best trade deals in the history of trade deals. Can there really be something in it or is he simply a wazzock trying his luck (and, quite frankly, risking his life)?	false
dilemmas_localised_description_wh3_dlc23_chd_dilemma_boon_of_hashut	Your actions have not gone unnoticed by your dark master, for he offers his twisted blessing. Empowered by mighty Hashut, your position among the Dawi-Zharr has never been stronger. Demand whatever you want from the Conclave of Evil; none will dare question your will now!	false
dilemmas_localised_description_wh3_dlc23_chd_dilemma_bygone_era	Deep within one of our mines, a prized relic has been uncovered; something from the time when our Ancestors first migrated to these lands, before we rightfully pledged allegiance to the Father of Darkness. Such an object is clearly of great import – what should we do with it? 	false
dilemmas_localised_description_wh3_dlc23_chd_dilemma_deal_with_the_devil	Following a great conflict in the Realm of Chaos, aspects of the four Chaos Gods appear before us in turn, offering the souls of captured Daemons, which could be used to further the development of our sorcerous creations, the K'daai. In return, they require mortal armaments, so that each may turn the tide of war against the other. Could this be a trap? What should we do?	false
dilemmas_localised_description_wh3_dlc23_chd_dilemma_embezzlement	A commander has claimed a large number of Labourers for his own purposes. At the very least, such an act is presumptuous, if not plain treachery. While he is too well connected to kill out of hand, we may be able to ensure he at least serves our purposes on a mission of our design. The only question is where to send him? 	false
dilemmas_localised_description_wh3_dlc23_chd_dilemma_fin_stabilization	An engineer has demonstrated a way with which we could dramatically improve the range and accuracy of our artillery pieces.

dilemmas_localised_description_wh3_dlc23_chd_dilemma_hidden_stash	Through our "See it, Slay It, Sorted" internal security campaign, it has become apparent that a radical malcontent within the ranks of the Infernal Guard has been squirrelling away weapons for some nefarious purpose. Perhaps he seeks, in vain of course, to challenge the natural order? As you might expect, a fitting, agonising and public example has been made of the would-be traitor, but this has slowed down our recruitment plans somewhat, though a true servant of Hashut would have nothing to fear.	false
dilemmas_localised_description_wh3_dlc23_chd_dilemma_mineral_surplus	One of the Overseers tasked with managing production in our mines has come to us with the news that, with the assistance of many (now dead) Labourers, he has extracted twice the amount of mineral wealth than his quota had demanded. What should we do we this sudden windfall?	false
dilemmas_localised_description_wh3_dlc23_chd_dilemma_misfire	Someone will pay for this – mark my words! Due to some no-doubt mortal error on the production line, our ammunition supplies are faulty, which will dramatically weaken our combat capability unless we intervene quickly. So what to do to address the problem?	false
dilemmas_localised_description_wh3_dlc23_chd_dilemma_out_of_control	An automated drilling machine has spun out of control and was last seen tunnelling towards one of our settlements. Obviously, there will be an enquiry, show trials and a round of brutal public executions later, when the, er, dust has settled, but what should we do to avert disaster here and now? 	false
dilemmas_localised_description_wh3_dlc23_chd_dilemma_raiding_expedition	The Conclave has decided that one of our senior commanders must lead an expedition to replenish our supply of Labourers. Ideally, Greenskins suit us best, for they are cowardly in the extreme and so, so stupid that they're easily dominated by the superior Dawi will. Where should we send this expedition so it is most fruitful?	false
dilemmas_localised_description_wh3_dlc23_chd_dilemma_sticky_situation	An exceptionally stupid Goblin Labourer, likely discontented with his meagre lot in life, has slipped and fallen into the machinery upon which he was working. This has temporarily slowed down production while his entrails are unwound and the mess is cleared away by his peers. Such a thing threatens to halt production entirely. What steps will you take?	false
dilemmas_localised_description_wh3_dlc23_chd_dilemma_stone_no_more	One of our adepts has come to us claiming he has found a way to stop Chaos Dwarf Sorcerers turning to stone as a result of their magical experiments in service of Hashut. Although it is clear he is probably lying, should we hear him out or just disembowel him before his peers right now?	false
dilemmas_localised_description_wh3_dlc23_chd_dilemma_towering_ziggurats	Thoughtfully, it would appear, an engineer has come to us, speaking of a new innovation for cranes, which should allow us to build even higher than ever before. But to what purpose should we put these new towers?	false

It seems the answer is clear...	false
dilemmas_localised_description_wh3_dlc23_dilemma_chd_convoy_dwarfs	A wandering Convoy of our weak-willed former kin has stumbled into our lands.

So many choices...	false
dilemmas_localised_description_wh3_dlc23_dilemma_chd_convoy_far_from_home	Signs of a troop column have been spotted ahead. Judging by the tracks, it looks as though this force has been moving without sleep or pause. Cresting the next hill, the gleam of bone and gold can be seen throughout the army. A host of Tomb Kings, richly adorned, is marching through this area. Their destination is unclear, but their opulence is not. We could descend upon them, and claim their riches for ourselves!	false
dilemmas_localised_description_wh3_dlc23_dilemma_chd_convoy_hobgoblin_tribute	An eager tribe of half-brained Hobgoblins have appeared from seemingly nowhere, intending to offer their services; Hashut only knows where they were hiding!

Yet while out on assignment, even our Convoy knows not to pass up the opportunity to attain more of the "right tools" for the job, having encountered a High Elf host from whom much profit could be forcibly reaped – both in long-limbed Labourers and loot reaped from beardless corpses.	false
dilemmas_localised_description_wh3_dlc23_dilemma_chd_convoy_offence_or_defence	A Hobgoblin Wolf Raider is being readied to ride out with a resupply of improved Hell-Forge Armoury surplus for the Convoy. While ensuring he delivers as much as his scrawny frame can carry, we also need to decide which equipment will give the Convoy the greatest chance of successfully repelling any threats.	false
dilemmas_localised_description_wh3_dlc23_dilemma_chd_convoy_ogre_mercenaries	The strength of an Ogre is unmatched anywhere! At least, that's what this group of rotund mercenaries assured us when offering to guard our trade Convoy on its route. Though the might of the Dawi-Zharr no doubt puts their claim to shame, the extra muscle wouldn't go amiss. Ogres' services, however, certainly would not come free of charge.	false
dilemmas_localised_description_wh3_dlc23_dilemma_chd_convoy_portals_part_1	While travelling through a maze of chaotic passages, our Convoy has encountered a mysterious looking portal, simply begging for further exploration. Both rewards and dangers could lie beyond its swirling vortex; is such a risk worth taking?	false
dilemmas_localised_description_wh3_dlc23_dilemma_chd_convoy_portals_part_2	Beyond the portal lay a bounty of Cargo, ripe for repossession. If someone was willing to leave it in the open like that, then surely nobody will miss it... except, of course, for the angry Daemons that greeted us upon our return, who demanded the return of their stolen horde.\\n\\nWe could fight to keep it, though simply returning it may grant an even greater reward...	false
dilemmas_localised_description_wh3_dlc23_dilemma_chd_convoy_portals_part_3_a	Who needs Cargo when you can secure the services of a party of vicious Daemons? On your generous return of the loot, two groups step forward, offering to rip your enemies into tiny, bloodstained pieces. Delightful! The bickering and chest-pounding that ensues between the groups is less pleasing. It seems you're going to have to choose...	false
dilemmas_localised_description_wh3_dlc23_dilemma_chd_convoy_power_overwhelming	Without warning, a chasm in the earth spontaneously appears in front of the Convoy forming a gaping mouth of razor-sharp teeth.

dilemmas_localised_description_wh3_dlc23_dilemma_chd_convoy_quick_way_down	A painstaking section of your Convoy’s route has required the cavalcade to lumber up an unexpectedly steep mountain, putting it behind schedule. Once reaching the pinnacle, the Convoy Master scouts a quicker route down the other side which would make up for the lost time. Given the sheer weight of the Convoy’s consignment, however, the shortcut would make for a perilous descent which may result in some damaged goods.	false
dilemmas_localised_description_wh3_dlc23_dilemma_chd_convoy_rats_in_a_tunnel	This route is endless! Our beleaguered Convoy has been travelling for what seems like forever, with no end in sight. Surely a detour through subterranean tunnels would get our goods to their destination sooner? The pernicious Skaven, however, may have something to say about it...	false
dilemmas_localised_description_wh3_dlc23_dilemma_chd_convoy_redeadify	Fog has descended around our Convoy. The smell is putrid and shuffling shapes can be glimpsed in the haze. This land around us teems with their shambling forms; we have stumbled, unwittingly, into the domain of the Undead. These creatures can be confronted head-on and the wretches put down for good or, alternatively, we can order some of our number to distract them while we make our escape, though they will ultimately have no hope against the necrotic masses.	false
dilemmas_localised_description_wh3_dlc23_dilemma_chd_convoy_the_ambush	Stealth is possibly not the strong suit of our would-be ambushers, who visibly await our Convoy from some rather questionable 'hiding' places. We could avoid them easily, of course, but it almost seems a disservice not to show them what a true ambush looks like...	false
dilemmas_localised_description_wh3_dlc23_dilemma_chd_convoy_the_guide	A guide has tracked down our Convoy, offering to lead the way to our destination in exchange for a reasonable donation to his pockets. His price is frankly extortionate, but as they say in business, time is of the essence.	false
dilemmas_localised_description_wh3_dlc23_dilemma_chd_convoy_trading_dark_elfs	A cacophony of roars and feral shrieks rings out ahead of your Convoy – a Dark Elf Beastmaster approaches! By the look of his shackled beasts, he is recently returned from an expedition into Norsca and poses little threat, his retinue of hunters visibly weary and battered from their run-ins with the Northmen and critters of the tundra. With a tired Druchii sneer, he offers the Convoy one of his creatures in exchange for some supplies. Though we care little for the Dark Elf’s plight, such a beast could be useful against future threats.	false
dilemmas_localised_description_wh3_dlc23_dilemma_chd_convoy_training_camp	The day may have just begun, but one of the scouts has already spotted a wide, flat, stone platform in an isolated area. A series of eight steps leads to an eight-sided arena, with grooves carved in the floor to drain the blood spilled. Unmistakably, this is a Khornate combat shrine: the perfect location to tutor troops and beat the weakness out of them.	false
dilemmas_localised_description_wh3_dlc23_dilemma_chd_convoy_way_of_lava	A recent eruption has created an unexpected opportunity for our Convoy; a land bridge of semi-molten rock, interspersed with fissures of lava and caustic gasses. We can traverse this rough, burning landscape and reach our destination sooner, but the heat may take the lives of some of our weaker personnel.	false
dilemmas_localised_description_wh3_dlc23_neu_ulrika_choice	Upon gaining entry into Nachthafen Castle, you discover that it indeed harbours the Vampire Ulrika Magdova Straghov and her mentor Countess Gabriella! While both are incredibly strong in their own right, Ulrika's lack of control has caught up with her, causing the two to be backed into a corner and outmatched by the adversary before them. “Let me fight them!” Ulrika snarls, her fangs bared and swords unsheathed. “I’ve bested greater warriors in single combat! I will not be found wanting for--“ Before she can continue, Gabriella swiftly steps forward to present another option: let them go, for Ulrika was turned against her will by a Vampire Countess. Gabriella continues, explaining that she was fulfilling a promise to train the young Vampiress to do no harm. The story seems genuine, but can such creatures of the night be trusted? The Sisterhood, who play the games of political misdirection?\\n\\nNo, it is clear what must be done…	false
dilemmas_localised_description_wh3_dlc24_cth_saytang_choice	The ground rumbles, for Saytang the Watcher approaches! Extending his Wind Bow in your direction, he takes his place by the side of your battle ranks in noble defence of Grand Cathay. Alongside you and the other sentinels under your command, the Dragons’ lands will be kept safe beneath his unmoving, watchful eye. Around the lofty heights from which he casts his gaze, the Winds blow strong to bring powerful blessings... yet who shall receive them is up to you.	false
dilemmas_localised_description_wh3_dlc24_dilemma_yuan_bo_start	The Winds of Magic gather, blowing through Lustria with an intensity that once harnessed, will expand the reach and power the Jade Compass exponentially. Yet the expedition to the continent has left your defences in Cathay spread far too thin. A Vampiric menace looms over Shang-Wu like a shadow; the undead scourge could strike at any moment and without proper protections, the region may fall to their greed and malice. Perhaps it would be wise to hand over rulership of the city to a trustworthy custodian, rather than attempting to fight enemies on two fronts.	false
dilemmas_localised_description_wh3_dlc24_ksl_golden_knight_choice	The Golden Knight arrives, consecrated by the Cult of Ursun and decreed by the Ice Court, a beacon of strength and an icon of Kislev. As the most feared combatant in the Motherland’s ranks, her influence on the battle lines will be immense, while her late father’s association with Boris Ursus affords her considerable bureaucratic gravitas, which could be of use to you. Which role will you give her first?	false

dilemmas_localised_description_wh3_dlc24_tze_aekold_helbras_choice	Aekold Helbrass approaches the great monolith, taking in all the power of its runes and incantations. However, he also spots something else: a carving of a Templar with a rampant Griffon upon his shield – an ancient image of a young Aekold himself, etched thousands of years prior! With confused anguish, Aekold travels further north into the Wastes until he encounters a portal atop a long flight of steps. As he reaches the top, he sees the image of himself once more… Yet this time, it steps out to destroy him! Both men strike, the young Templar’s sword slicing through Aekold’s armour and into his ribs. Aekold’s sword, however, takes the Templar’s head from his shoulders, quashing the final vestiges of humanity within Aekold’s own soul.	false
dilemmas_localised_description_wh3_dlc24_tze_blue_scribes_choice	The Blue Scribes marvel at the vast library before them, eager to fill it to the brim with all manner of destructive magic and abilities. Their bickering however, is endlessly tiresome. While one yearns to join us in our path to Ruin, destroying the mortal world, the other longs for the towering halls of your library, eager to continue transcribing their mess of jumbled scrolls in Tzeentch's honour. Though the  constant argument has been the cause of several headaches, they do raise an interesting proposition. You could lead these harbingers of Chaos into battle, where their records will be written in the blood of your foes, yet perhaps their work is better suited to your libraries, where this collection of occult power is sure to grow under their watch.	false
dilemmas_localised_description_wh3_dlc25_dwf_book_of_grudges_dilemma_faction_incurs_grudge_1	Where business booms and gold changes hands, treacherous snakes far too often rear their heads. Such was the case that after a recent successful business deal, the bulk of purchased goods destined for your storehouses was snatched by bandits-for-hire from under the cavalcade’s nose and rerouted to a new rival. Theft is not just a crime, but an act of blatant disrespect that stains the honour of all Dawi – one that must be answered for in blood!	false
dilemmas_localised_description_wh3_dlc25_dwf_book_of_grudges_dilemma_faction_incurs_grudge_2	A vile new enemy has proven themselves without honour, daring to insult the Ancestor Gods to all who will listen. In a fit of ignorance or stupidity, they proclaim our mighty forebears unworthy of worship, spitting on all Dwarfkind with their vitriol. In the name of Grungni, Valaya and Grimnir, we must punish these petulant fools; grinding them into the dirt ought to prove the divine might of our gods!	false
dilemmas_localised_description_wh3_dlc25_dwf_book_of_grudges_dilemma_faction_incurs_grudge_3	Rumours spread of a reckless fool who is loudly besmirching the quality of Dwarf engineering and mocking the failures of your past.

The Clans demand vengeance at once, and they will not rest until justice has been served.	false
dilemmas_localised_description_wh3_dlc25_dwf_book_of_grudges_dilemma_grudges_building_1	Any enemy flaunts their misdeeds, relishing in the suffering they've wrought upon our brethren, and the longer their crimes go unpunished, the more insufferable their arrogance grows.

dilemmas_localised_description_wh3_dlc25_dwf_book_of_grudges_dilemma_too_many_grudges_1	Of late, too many foes walk the land undaunted by our might. One need only glance at the Dammaz Kron to see a list of slights in need of avenging, yet the perpetrators walk free, without fear of reprisal. These grudges must be settled soon, lest we be seen as snivelling cowards by the other races. Already they whisper behind our backs, questioning our resolve.

dilemmas_localised_description_wh3_dlc25_dwf_dilemma_malakai_caravan_detoured_1	A Caravan from Grand Cathay has arrived appearing to come in peace, despite the angry demeanour of its Caravan Master indicating otherwise. The red-faced envoy huffily speaks through a breathless interpreter, ranting about his intended destination – the besieged Dwarf trade hub – where he has been sent to fetch a Dragon’s purchased goods. Having scouted the upright walking ratmen’s blockade with horror and disbelief, he had no choice but to reroute his sparsely armed cavalcade to you. This situation may need to be handled delicately, lest we cause a costly diplomatic incident…	false
dilemmas_localised_description_wh3_dlc25_dwf_dilemma_malakai_caravan_detoured_2a	It was no cheap feat, but your payment has successfully preserved the Dawi’s reputation with Cathay and its trade partners.

Swathes of Dwarf refugees have started arriving at your settlements, but far be it from you to cast your downtrodden brethren away.

The continual influx of more and more Dwarfs into your main Hold has caused some overcrowding and is stretching your resources thin, the main problem being that most of the new arrivals are still not completely self-sufficient. You must give purpose to idle Dawi hands, or send them to greener pastures lest this problem spills over into crisis.	false
dilemmas_localised_description_wh3_dlc25_dwf_dilemma_malakai_dwarf_refugees_2b	The anger amongst the homeless Dawi is palpable, for the vengeance that burns in a Dwarf’s heart never quells until final retribution is attained.

Unfortunately, Imperial 'country folk' are far more xenophobic than their slightly more sophisticated city counterparts – the nobles are being extremely uncooperative and downright rude toward the Dwarf envoys you sent to peacefully investigate.\\n\\nYou must now speak to these nobles personally. Insulting as it may be, perhaps money is one possible way around this. Another could be a not-so-gentle arm-twisting...	false
dilemmas_localised_description_wh3_dlc25_dwf_dilemma_malakai_manling_priorities_2a	The nobles are much more receptive to the language of gold, but are asking an extremely steep price for information about the Treeman attacks, which you are not willing to pay.

He feared the Daemon.	false
dilemmas_localised_description_wh3_prologue_daemons_price_2	My brother’s lifeless body fell to the ground. The Bloodthirster roared as he threw Gerik’s screaming skull onto the bridge. I crossed the Chasm, the Daemon beside me. My army wavered, yet followed, fearing my wrath.	false

Fear me.\\n\\nIt should have been a time of triumph, yet I heard my soldiers sniping behind my back!\\n\\nI ordered Gerik to round up the seditious ones. They were  Ungols who came with me from Kislev, and supposedly my most loyal. They stand before me, griping and whining about returning to the Motherland. I let them go, but stripped of everything – armour, weapons, even their boots!\\n\\nIf they cast me in the role of warlord, then I will play the part!	false

Any who opposed him were hung from the walls.\\n\\nThose that remained suffered at the hands of the savage Northmen.\\n\\nI found Kurnz's journal, hidden in his quarters. His words are evidence of heresy. Ursun's judgement will be swift. If I find him, I will kill him.	false
dilemmas_localised_description_wh3_prologue_post_altar	I approached the Brazen Altar and quenched my sword in the blood. As I withdrew it, dark runes glowed upon the blade. It was a name – one to speak at the Screaming Chasm, one to summon the Bridge-Maker. A toll would be required, and my faith, tested. Whatever trial awaited, I was ready.	false
dilemmas_localised_description_wh3_prologue_revealed_the_maze	How long did I wander? Hours? Days? Yet finally, I reached the heart of the maze. Dark runes appeared before my eyes, but the journal revealed their secrets: a way for mortals to span the Screaming Chasm and reach the Howling Citadel.\\n\\nI must go to the land of the Blood God.

A man of faith can withstand its evil and harness its power.	false
dilemmas_localised_description_wh3_prologue_the_ruins	We came upon ruins – a village of hide tents dominated by a totem of a white crow. They belonged to Northmen, enemies of Kislev, who worshipped Tzeentch. On the ground, smeared in blood, was the emblem of the traitor Slavin Kurnz. His army had slaughtered the tribe. No mercy was given, but I felt no pity. In these unforgiving lands, would the Northmen have treated us any different?	false
dilemmas_localised_description_wh3_prologue_trials	By campfire light, I read the journal. Why did Kurnz abandon his duty?\\n\\nBefore he left Dervingard, he made forays into the Chaos Wastes. He fought enemies and even gained the allegiance of tribes. He called such feats "the trials". They allowed him to navigate these hostile lands.\\n\\nIf I am to survive here, I must perform these trials. The journal tells of great rewards if I do.	false
dilemmas_localised_description_wh3_prologue_tribute	Word has spread. The tribes hear of my exploits. A Kislevite who subjugates Daemons and emerges from Tzeentch's labyrinth.\\n\\nWhere before they would have ridden out to crush us, now they send an envoy and some piffling tribute to try and buy my allegiance. Gerik urges caution, as usual, but I could turn this to my advantage. Dominate these lands, not just with war, but with words. \\n\\nThrough such base diplomacy, I can further my quest to find Ursun. All I need do is accept their gift.	false
dilemmas_localised_description_wh3_prologue_trouble_at_beacon	We searched for our kin fleeing south. We found them travelling the hidden trails to avoid open ground. Some had left Dervingard. They said the stronghold had fallen; that its commander, the Boyar Slavin Kurnz, had abandoned his post.\\n\\nYet others fled from a smaller fort they called the Beacon. They spoke of a tribal chief who thirsted for bloodshed: Skollden, the Wolf of Dervingard.	false

dilemmas_localised_description_wh_dlc03_bst_command_of_the_herd	In the herd, strength is the only qualifier. A foolish but admirable beast challenged you for control of the herd and lost.

dilemmas_localised_description_wh_dlc03_bst_dont_lick_a_toad	The lair of a Jabberslythe - a mutated and horrendous abomination - has been found, with the creature still within. We could harness this beast to bolster the herd and risk madness or leave it to its abominable rest.	false
dilemmas_localised_description_wh_dlc03_bst_gaze_of_darkness	Our devotion to madness and destruction has drawn the favour of the Chaos Gods, who wish to reward our calamitous actions with a gift. Yet we could reject it. Shall we do so? Or shall we accept this Ruinous offering?	false

dilemmas_localised_description_wh_dlc03_bst_ruinous_rituals	The Ruinous Powers look down upon us with ire, lord. Perhaps we were not diligent enough in sowing catastrophe? Perhaps you do not care? If you do, a sacrifice of warriors should appease their dark desires. If you do not, then the herd awaits…	false

dilemmas_localised_description_wh_dlc03_full_moon_preparations_lunar_eclipse	The moon is suffused with a deep, dark crimson - a sign of the rage of the Ruinous Powers, and a call for the Beastmen to see this rage manifested.

Lead them, Beastlord - seize glory!	false
dilemmas_localised_description_wh_dlc04_vmp_vlad_von_carstein_the_carstein_ring_stage_2	Vlad has kept his revivification a secret from the general populace - both mortal and living - so far, as this serves to further his machinations, but now it is time to make the Midnight Aristocracy either quail in fear of domination or flock to his banner. But how best to display such power? Through a bloody massacre or the tempting of Dark Magic and the promise to share?	false
dilemmas_localised_description_wh_dlc05_wef_asrai_asur_druchii	Carried by elegantly-hewn ships, our cousins have travelled from the distant lands of Ulthuan to visit us. After so many long years, they have finally deigned to visit their forest brethren. Is this a gracious visit, or an omen of arrogance? Do you consider this a slight or a blessing? Will you grant them an audience with the Elven Council?	false
dilemmas_localised_description_wh_dlc05_wef_children_of_eternity	The Asrai have long had a… patchy relationship with the denizens of the forest. Whilst often the two peoples get along harmoniously, there have been issues. Lately, malevolent Dryads have taken to kidnapping Elven children for fun. When brought to justice they remain unrepentant - it is their forest, they say. To burn them would anger the forest, but surely they must be made to pay for their crimes against the Asrai?	false
dilemmas_localised_description_wh_dlc05_wef_festival_of_the_equinox	Interlopers into the Trickster's Woods have been caught and brought before you to face justice. The sentence is clear: death. Yet before you can pass judgement, one of the captives issues a brazen challenge; if he can last one hour in battle with a Wardancer, then he and his friends go free. If not, he accepts your sentence. It is a... bold request, but one you have no obligation to accept.	false
dilemmas_localised_description_wh_dlc05_wef_heavens_or_the_underworld	The Asrai wish to erect a new shrine within Athel Loren, to give praise to the gods they so faithfully serve. Yet the question is posed - to whom should this shrine be dedicated? The two frontrunners are Asuryan or Khaine, yet ultimately the choice is yours. Do you wish honour the Phoenix King, Asuryan, the wise and just ruler of the Elven pantheon, or his brother Khaine; harsh and ruthless God of Battle?	false
dilemmas_localised_description_wh_dlc05_wef_shape_shifters	The Elves of the Skymark Reaches, Cavaroc, come to you with a proposal. These subjects of Lord Edrael have ever been brash; always the first into battle and the last to apologise, yet their latest endeavours are somewhat more… nefarious. They wish to subvert the Bretonnian dukedom of Quenelles by planting shapeshifting forest spirits amongst the court as Damsels. Such a sneaky scheme is sure to wreak havoc amongst the Bretonnians, which may be to our advantage. Do you wish to aid them, or not?	false
dilemmas_localised_description_wh_dlc05_wef_the_dreaming_wood	A young Glade Lord, full of hope and naivety, wishes to journey into the Dreaming Wood to recover a lost artefact. Headstrong and confident, perhaps to the point of arrogance; the Dreaming Wood is a twisted domain ruled by the Prince of Pleasure, Slaanesh - to enter is to dance with the Chaos God of madness and desire. Most who enter never return, claimed body and soul by the forces of Ruin. Yet this Glade Lord seems self-assured - do you allow them to recover this item or forbid the journey?	false
dilemmas_localised_description_wh_dlc05_wef_the_fate_of_the_body	As with all things of the natural world, a denizen of the forest has shed their mortal shell and become one with the woods. Yet the question remains of how to honour the body, now that they have passed. They could be sacrificed in the flames, immolated as Orion is each year - a warrior's pyre - or the body could be planted deep within the ground, allowing the hungry roots of the Deepwood to draw strength from the mouldering remains...	false
dilemmas_localised_description_wh_dlc05_wef_the_great_stag	The Great Stag is a revered and treasured creature of Athel Loren; renowned for its magical, ethereal properties, many say it represents the soul of the forest itself. On a hunt one day, you come across one of the majestic creatures, presenting you with a unique opportunity. It is the way of the forest to hunt, a part of the natural cycle of life. If you could claim the antlers of such a great beast, you would be honoured as true master of the Hunt. Yet there is much to be said for staying your hand, and leaving the beast in peace...	false
dilemmas_localised_description_wh_dlc05_wef_the_night_glens	Lady Morlanna and Lord Arlas have been turning a blind eye to the practises of their subjects, and hence the shadowed Night Glens are awash with forbidden and arcane magics. The Elven subjects are ever-accommodating, and invite you to join them, perhaps in the hope that you may spare them retribution, and even learn something for your trouble...?	false
dilemmas_localised_description_wh_dlc05_wef_vaults_of_winter	Arranoc lies under the eternal summer sun, scarcely knowing night.

dilemmas_localised_description_wh_dlc07_brt_confederation_artois	The forested realm of Artois has notable significance in Bretonnia’s history – it was the location of the first Gathering of the Companions, where the fourteen newly-united dukedoms were first legitimised. Emblazoned on the Heraldry of Artois is the head of the monstrous boar Morthanok, symbol of Lord Folgar, the first Duke of Artois. A renowned hunter and lancer, Folgar's skills made him an invaluable Companion Knight who fought in several Great Battles alongside Gilles le Breton. Morthanok’s image is a reminder of the inaugural feast of the Companions, for which Folgar hunted down and slew the dangerous beast.	false
dilemmas_localised_description_wh_dlc07_brt_confederation_bastonne	Prior to the Lady appearing before the Uniter and his fellow Grail Knights, the young Gilles rode out to cleanse his homeland Bastonne of the foul beasts wreaking havoc there.

To this day, the beast’s image and its pelt are revered in Bastonne, with the armour still kept and worn by the duke ceremoniously as well as in warfare.	false
dilemmas_localised_description_wh_dlc07_brt_confederation_bordeleaux	Bordeleaux is a land peacefully split over religious matters. Those residing on the coastlines assert that the Lady’s domain ends where the water turns salt – where the domain of Manann begins. The tempestuous Sea God’s tri-forked symbol is a reminder of the bond he forged with the bloodline of the Bordelen dukes, during the Tenth Great Battle, against the sea-raiders from the North.

dilemmas_localised_description_wh_dlc07_brt_confederation_bretonnia	King Leoncoeur's homeland of Couronne currently flies the heraldry of Bretonnia. The heritage of Couronne’s dukedom has ties to the original Grail Companions of Gilles the Uniter – their first duke was the heroic Carleond, saviour of the city and older brother of the most devoted Companion of them all, Thierulf of Lyonesse. As children, the two brothers were said to have miraculously slain a great lion together, which is why the heraldries of Lyonesse and Couronne – and hence, the heraldry of Bretonnia – display a lion’s image.	false
dilemmas_localised_description_wh_dlc07_brt_confederation_carcassonne	It was Duke Lambard of Carcassonne, one of the famed Companions of Gilles the Uniter, who first adopted the image of the sword for his nation’s heraldry. Although Carcassonne was one of few Bretonnian provinces that did not see a Great Battle on its lands, Lambard rode out to fight victoriously in nine of them. The blade symbolises Carcassonne’s warrior-culture, attested by their centuries-old tradition of gifting every newborn son a freshly-forged sword, which they are made to touch as soon as they enter the world. It is then ornamentally placed above their cots until it can be wielded.	false
dilemmas_localised_description_wh_dlc07_brt_confederation_lyonesse	The Heraldry of Lyonesse was originally adopted by Thierulf, the most devoted of Gilles le Breton’s Grail Companions. In the years before the Great Battles, Thierulf of Lyonesse married Gilles’ sister and became his brother-in-law’s most trusted friend. He would later be one of the two Companions blessed by the Lady alongside Gilles himself, going on to fight victoriously in all twelve of the Great Battles with him. Lyonesse's Lion-symbol represents Thierhulf’s courageous nature in battle, and also the beast that he and his brother are said to have miraculously slain as children.	false
dilemmas_localised_description_wh_dlc07_brt_confederation_parravon	Adorning the family standard of the dukes of Parravon is the pegasus rampant, the ultimate symbol of wealth for any Knight fortunate enough to acquire one. This Heraldry was adopted by Lord Agilgar, first Duke of Parravon and one of the famed Companions of Gilles the Uniter. It is said to be a likeness of his winged steed Glorfinial, lord and sire of all Royal pegasi, whom he befriended. It was atop his friend Glorfinial that Agilgar was carried into the Fifth Great Battle – the liberation of Parravon – paving his way to Companionhood by his actions that day.	false

He has use for such a warlord, and ‘requests’ you fight at his side in the war to come. Your armies shall march with his legions as he ravages the southern realms - the rewards will be great...

dilemmas_localised_description_wh_dlc08_qb_nor_monster_hunt_0_stage_2	The weather around the Tower of Khrakk is even more inhospitable than first thought. This unusually harsh climate is seemingly unbearable for most things to dwell in too long. The tundra is devoid of life, which may also be evidence that the mighty Frigustrex is nearby, usurping all other predators in the vicinity.

A slave languishing in a thrall pen up in the Goromadny Mountains is found repetitively mumbling stories about a ruthless and powerful Shaggoth with frightening power.

But most importantly, he bears a tattoo known to be the mark of the fallen tribe.\\n\\nThe slave may be able to help you find your bounty, but his owner is asking an extortionate price for what is otherwise a useless, broken man.

The armoured figure slapped his mount's neck with a mailed fist and cursed in a voice as cold as death "Weeks of searching the mountain caves and still you have failed to find what I desire. If you are wrong about the locations to the northwest and we should find no dragon's corpse to serve me into death, I shall feast upon your soul". It seems that the Undead Lord is searching for new materials for use in his foul Necromancy.
