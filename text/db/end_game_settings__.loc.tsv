end_game_settings_settings_tooltip_endgame_minor_cult_cabal	[[col:red]]WARNING: Enabling this option can eventually have a large impact on game balance[[/col]]\\n\\nWhen checked, the Cabal will be one of the potential Unusual Locations that can appear during your campaign.\\n\\nBe warned, however, that the Cabal is one of the most powerful Cults in existence and, as such, this location can eventually have a very large impact on your campaign.

end_game_settings_settings_tooltip_endgame_minor_cult_crimson_plague	When checked, the Covenant of the Crimson Plague will be one of the potential Unusual Locations that can appear during your campaign.\\n\\nBe warned that there is a chance, albeit an extremely small chance, that this Cult can cause a potentially horrific, and game ending, scenario through means of Plague.	false

end_game_settings_settings_tooltip_endgame_minor_cult_doomsphere	When checked, the Faulty Doomsphere will be one of the potential Unusual Locations that can appear during your campaign.\\n\\nUnderstandably, not everyone enjoys devastating (and unstable) weapons of mass destruction appearing in their territory, so you may disable this as a possibility if you prefer.	false
end_game_settings_settings_tooltip_endgame_minor_cult_purple_hand	When checked, the Purple Hand will be one of the potential Unusual Locations that can appear during your campaign.\\n\\nThe Purple Hand is a Tzeentchian Cult who promise powerful benefits but in return can corrupt your lands and drastically change the state of the campaign should their plans ultimately succeed.\\nBy all means trust a Tzeench Cult, go ahead, surely it will all be fine.	false
