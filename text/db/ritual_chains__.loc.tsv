ritual_chains_description_wh3_dlc25_ritual_emp_don_amethyst_artillery	[[i]]Exposed to Elspeth’s deathly touch, magical munitions can be launched across the battlefield to horrifying effect.[[/i]]	false

ritual_chains_description_wh3_dlc25_ritual_emp_don_cannons	[[i]]The Great Cannon is widely feared for the ease with which it rips apart flesh and armour alike, its simple engineering easily modified by the school’s designs to magnify its devastation.[[/i]]	false
ritual_chains_description_wh3_dlc25_ritual_emp_don_cav_guns	[[i]]The Pistoliers and Outriders of the Empire are experts at harassing enemy flanks and evading harm, skills that are aided by the Gunnery School’s cavalry wing.[[/i]]	false

ritual_chains_description_wh3_dlc25_ritual_emp_don_helblasters	[[i]]With its rudimentary central crank and multiple barrels, the Helblaster is the somewhat unreliable invention of a deranged former professor at the school, now available with new improvements.[[/i]]	false
ritual_chains_description_wh3_dlc25_ritual_emp_don_helstorm	[[i]]The Empire’s favoured solution to having more projectiles-per-second fired from a piece of artillery is the Helstorm Rocket Battery, for which the Gunnery School’s modifications do little to complicate.[[/i]]	false
ritual_chains_description_wh3_dlc25_ritual_emp_don_inf_guns	[[i]]Wielding a range of high-powered black powder weapons, the riflemen of the Empire are deadly at all ranges, and even deadlier when boosted by the Gunnery School’s standard-issue modifications.[[/i]]	false
ritual_chains_description_wh3_dlc25_ritual_emp_don_land_ship	[[i]]The original Marienburg Land Ship design was never too difficult to improve upon, with the Engineers School’s close study of the hulking War Machine offering useful areas of improvement.[[/i]]	false
ritual_chains_description_wh3_dlc25_ritual_emp_don_mortors	[[i]]The Empire Mortars’ high firing arcs make them the most difficult to operate accurately, but with the Gunnery School’s developments, the artillery’s tactical advantage can be exponentially increased.[[/i]]	false
ritual_chains_description_wh3_dlc25_ritual_emp_don_steam_tank	[[i]]The blueprints for the meticulously built Steam Tanks of the Empire are kept under lock and key in the Engineers School, including variations in the machine’s design and battle protocols.[[/i]]	false
ritual_chains_description_wh3_dlc26_kho_cloak_of_skulls_1	For centuries, Kakalekh defeated the countless champions that ventured into his corner of Nehekhara, proclaiming himself the greatest duellist of all Desert Kings. When Skulltaker called for the strongest of the Nehekharans, only the foolhardy Kakalekh answered. To this day, his skull still whispers the word: "strongest".	false
ritual_chains_description_wh3_dlc26_kho_cloak_of_skulls_10	To the Order of the Silver Hammer, the Witch Hunter was a zealous weapon gravely feared by the Empire's hidden Cultists. As Johann rooted out Daemons, he would openly challenge them to defy their inevitable deaths. Skulltaker answered.	false
ritual_chains_description_wh3_dlc26_kho_cloak_of_skulls_2	Skulltaker was destined to come for the Bretonnian Knight's bloodline sooner or later, for it carried greater strength with each passing generation. With his final breath, Dubois uttered that his successors would not share his fate. Only time will tell.	false
ritual_chains_description_wh3_dlc26_kho_cloak_of_skulls_3	After his wayward Waaagh! dissipated in the far north, Ironneck trudged alone through the Wastes non-stop for two whole years, his uncanny knack for survival and killing Marauder Chieftains becoming legend. Skulltaker needed two neck-blows to take his skull, the Orc Warboss living up to his name.	false
ritual_chains_description_wh3_dlc26_kho_cloak_of_skulls_4	Once an undefeated Tong chieftain, Mihr fulfilled a shamanic prophecy and received the power to dream the location of his forthcoming battles. Skulltaker, however, he did not foresee, and Mihr fought his fate so furiously that his severed head still spoke, even after death.	false
ritual_chains_description_wh3_dlc26_kho_cloak_of_skulls_5	Devoting herself to Naggaroth’s wars, Qintarra was a lone Druchii warrior of unmatched skill who scorned earthly accolades. Meeting Skulltaker on Blighted Isle’s shores, it took only three exchanges of word and blade for the Daemon to overcome her.	false
ritual_chains_description_wh3_dlc26_kho_cloak_of_skulls_6	Drongash called it being "well-equipped", but his hateful peers were certain only pure luck could afford a Chaos Dwarf such a long life on patrol in the Dark Lands’ most dangerous and deserted reaches. Drongash was only unlucky once, then never again.	false
ritual_chains_description_wh3_dlc26_kho_cloak_of_skulls_7	As a wordless youth who wrought havoc with his two-handed sword, Ek attracted Khorne’s gaze at the forefront of many bloody conflicts. Skulltaker challenged the youngling marauder by drawing a claw across his blade – a language Ek understood – and they 'spoke' masterfully until the end.	false
ritual_chains_description_wh3_dlc26_kho_cloak_of_skulls_8	As a decorated Empire Captain, Hans had a military career punctuated by death. Spurning promotion to maximise his time on the frontline, thousands died alongside him, but so too did his enemies. Numberless mortal wounds should have killed him long before Skulltaker’s challenge.	false
ritual_chains_description_wh3_dlc26_kho_cloak_of_skulls_9	It seemed that wherever Lord Penko sailed, despair, warfare and ruin followed, feeding the Vampire Admiral's own arcane strength and power. Such an aura and rapidly spreading reputation for belligerence may have attracted Khorne’s attention eventually, but it caught Skulltaker’s first.	false
