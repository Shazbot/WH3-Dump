unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh2_dlc09_tmb_art_casket_of_souls	At the heart of each tomb of the mightiest king there lies a casket, inscribed with hieroglyphs of malediction. Within this sarcophagus resides the tormented souls of those who have incited a Tomb King's wrath. Powerful binding inscriptions ensure that these souls cannot leave their prison until the moment when the casket is opened. When a Casket of Souls is opened, blinding light spills across the battlefield as countless souls scream into the air seeking freedom from the suffering of their confinement. These spirits plunge through the bodies of the Tomb Kings' enemies, and the hapless victims suffer unbearable agony as their life essence is utterly drained. To die thus is far worse than a physical death, for the very souls of those who perish in this manner become ensnared by the power of the casket. A Casket of Souls is a devastating weapon, for all who look upon it risk eternal damnation and imprisonment.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh2_dlc09_tmb_art_screaming_skull_catapult	The catapults of a Tomb King's eternal army are akin to the stone throwers of other races, but instead of flinging rocks at the foe, they throw volleys of flaming skulls. The Liche Priests cast terrible curses upon every one of these skulls, enchanting them so that they scream hideously as they are hurled through the air, rising to a deafening crescendo just before they strike their target. Those are the very death screams of the skulls' former owners, the wailing shrieks of those slaughtered on the field of battle and the agonised cries of prisoners captured at the moment of their execution. Many battle-hardened warriors are driven to the edge of insanity by the blood-curdling sound. This horrific ammunition bursts into hellish, ethereal flames when it is launched, and as the skulls arc through the air, they blaze an eerie trail of green-fire behind them. Most of these skulls explode on impact, sending fragments of splintered bone in all directions and engulfing those nearby in a wash of balefire. Others smash into their target with horrifying force, infernal flames spilling out of empty eye sockets as the skulls chew through armour and warm flesh alike.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh2_dlc09_tmb_cav_necropolis_knights	Necropolis Knights are elite warriors who ride atop giant snake-shaped statues. Their monstrous mounts shatter bones with every swipe of their tails and sink scimitar-sized fangs deep into soft flesh. When Necropolis Knights are awakened to serve in the Tomb King's eternal army, the Necroserpents coiled above their resting places magically slither to Unlife as well; rider and mount are animated by the same warrior spirit, and they move as one being, riding to war in perfect ranks of terrifying cavalry. Necroserpents travel beneath the ground at a relentless pace, emerging from the depths with sand cascading off their forms, warriors standing proudly upon their hooded backs with spears lowered, ready to spill the blood of their foes. Serpentine bodies weave through the battlefield, bladed, fangs and tails lashing out in all directions, leaving a trail of death and woe in their wake. There are few who can stand against the charge of a Necropolis Knight, for they are incredibly powerful and difficult to destroy. As mount and rider share the same soul, only by destroying both can an opponent truly defeat a Necropolis Knight. Few foes are equal to such a task.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh2_dlc09_tmb_cav_nehekhara_horsemen	Regiments of Undead horsemen race across the sandy planes mounted on the fleshless remains of their once-proud steeds, weapons lowered as they gallop towards their foes. These skeletal riders drive their heavy spears into their foes with bone-jarring force, using well-aimed thrusts that punch clean through torsos and rip open throats in a spray of blood. Those not impaled by the cavalry rider's razor-sharp spearheads are trampled into the ground by the thundering hooves of skeletal steeds. When the Liche Priests summon the Tomb King's army from their sandy graves, fully formed cavalry columns stride out of the pyramids at the head of the legions. When the enemy is sighted, the cavalry regiment's hornblower signals the charge and a deep unsettling discord reverberates about the desert. This otherworldly sound shakes the dust from statues, and a disquieting feeling of dread permeates across the battlefield. As one, the Undead steeds gallop towards their quarry, the skeletal riders raising their shields and lowering their spears in perfect unison. It is a brave foe indeed that does not flee as these deathless horsemen bear down upon them.	false

unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh2_dlc09_tmb_cav_skeleton_horsemen_archers	The horse archers of Nehekhara are likened to an angry desert wind, one that appears suddenly and leaves only the dead and the dying in its wake. Skeleton Horsemen Archers move relentlessly across the battlefield, firing volleys of magically blessed arrows into their foes before turning about and escaping retribution. As the Undead cavalry turn, they disappear from view, riding into the cloud of dust thrown up by the hooves of their skeletal steeds. Before the horse archers' stunned victims can recover their wits, the Undead horsemen reappear, loosing another deadly salvo. Skeleton Horsemen Archers are the outriders and scouts of the Tomb Kings' army. Whereas mortal horses need regular rest and water, skeletal steeds cross the vast tracts of open desert at a relentless pace. Even in death, the Undead horsemen maintain an innate ability to track and hunt their quarry through the shifting dunes, and no sandstorm can obscure their targets. As scouts, Skeleton Horsemen Archers hinder the movements of the enemy and harass their flanks in fleeting yet bloody skirmishes. These attacks do much to slow the advance of the Tomb Kings' enemies, pinning them in place while the Undead infantry are deployed.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh2_dlc09_tmb_cha_arkhan	Arkhan the Black, known now and forever as the Liche King, was the first and most loyal of the evil Nagash's followers. He helped lead the coup which brought the arch-necromancer to power, and he was the first, after his Lord, to imbibe the Elixir of Life. Arkhan was the most adept of Nagash's pupils in the study of dark sorcery, and he quickly rose to become the necromancer's trusted vizier and principal lieutenant. He led many armies against Nagash's enemies and was never defeated in open combat. In the end, however, the sheer numbers of the Priest Kings' soldiers forced Nagash to retreat. It was Arkhan who led the suicidal counter-attack that gave Nagash the opportunity to escape. For over an hour he held back the Army of the Seven Kings through feats of martial prowess and powerful sorcery. Arkhan finally fell, not to a hero's sword, but to a single spear hurled by an unknown soldier. He stared in horror at the shaft protruding from his chest, knowing that it had pierced his heart. With his dying breath, he threatened that a terrible curse would befall any who touched his corpse, and with that, he slumped to the ground. Within seconds, dark flames had consumed Arkhan's flesh leaving behind only a blackened skeleton. Whilst the rest of Nagash's followers were beheaded and burnt, none dared risk desecrating Arkhan's remains, and so they covered them under a cairn of stones instead. Nagash did not forget his most able lieutenant, and when he returned to wreak vengeance on Nehekhara, Arkhan was reborn as the Liche King - the first of Nagash's nine Dark Lords. These foul beings were the foremost of Nagash's captains, and they brought despair and destruction to his foes.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh2_dlc09_tmb_cha_khalida	Khalida Neferher, the Warrior-Queen of Lybaras, was highly respected across all the lands of Nehekhara. Her intelligence and bravery were as legendary as her intense sense of honour and justice. Her reign was tragically short, as she was cut down in her prime, and all of Nehekhara mourned her passing. Khalida was embalmed and placed in a seated position within a specially made reliquary. There she sits unmoving, her face concealed behind a beautiful death mask created in her likeness. In times of need Khalida awakens, and the power of Asaph infuses her mummified remains. Her flesh returns to its former beauty, gradually becoming as pale and hard as pristine white marble. Gracefully, she rises from her throne and glides across the temple floor, commanding the tall heavy doors to open with a delicate motion of her hand. Her famed archer legions, buried in vast tomb pits beside the temple, arise at her bidding, marching alongside their immortal warrior-queen as they did in life, bringing death to those that intrude upon her realm.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh2_dlc09_tmb_cha_khatep	Khatep, known as the Liche Lord, is the current Grand Hierophant of Khemri, and the religious head of the Mortuary Cult's hieratic council. Khatep is the oldest and wisest of all the Liche Priest and the first member of their order to truly deny death's embrace, if not the ravages of time. He is ancient beyond memory, cadaverous and hunched over as if he carries the weight of epochs upon his shoulders. Following the casting of Nagash's Great Ritual, civil war threatened to destroy Nehekhara. Khatep therefore took it upon himself to restore order. He broke the magical seals of the Great Pyramid of Khemri and awoke the greatest of the Tomb Kings: Settra. At the end of the mighty incantation Settra arose and smote any who opposed him. Before long all bowed their heads to Settra, and though he sat once more upon the throne of Khemri, his wrath was great. Settra was angry foremost with the Mortuary Cult, believing they had whispered lies about the extent of their powers. In his fury, he exiled Khatep from Khemri and forbade him to set foot within any of the great cities until such a time as he could fulfil the Mortuary Cult's ancient promise and reinstate the golden age of Nehekhara. Thus, Khatep wanders the deserts in search of scrolls, inscriptions and relics of power that he believes will restore his beloved kingdom to its former glory.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh2_dlc09_tmb_cha_liche_priest	Liche Priests and Master Necromancers are the undying members of Nehekhara's Mortuary Cult, and they hold the secrets to Unlife. They know the rituals needed to draw forth spirits from the Realm of Souls and bind them once more into corporeal bodies. It is they who rouse the Tomb Kings and their courts from their slumber and awaken their armies for war. Liche Priests and Master Necromancers are also the keepers of Nehekhara's arcane lore. Through ritualistic incantations, they call upon the power of ancient gods to bestow blessings upon the warriors of the Tomb Kings, infusing their ancient bones with magical energy. Similarly, they cast terrible curses upon their foes, summoning vengeful desert spirits to feast on their souls.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh2_dlc09_tmb_cha_necrotect	Necrotects were the artisans of ancient Nehekhara - not common labourers, but architects of extraordinary skills whose ambitions far outpaced what could be achieved in a mortal lifespan. In death, Necrotects have lost none of their frenetic drive. They are filled with a compulsive need to pull down the inferior, vulgar cities of their enemies and supplant them with vast monuments of their own design. In life, Necrotects were stern taskmasters who oversaw tens of thousands of Nehekharans as they toiled under the blazing sun. Under their gaze, an army of masons carved huge slabs of rock out of cliff faces before vast columns of slaves dragged the stones across the desert and hauled them into position. All Necrotects were foul tempered, and they would dispense summary punishment at the slightest provocation, hating anything and anyone that threatened their art. In death, much of their work lies broken or damaged by the greed of tomb robbers and invading armies. Necrotects have been driven to a  blinding rage by the wanton desecration of their beloved masterpieces, and they have sworn to have revenge. In battle, Necrotects lead the Tomb King's regiments like the work gangs of old. They exude the same aura of hatred they possessed in life, and their mere presence instils a magical state of fury in the Undead warriors of Nehekhara.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh2_dlc09_tmb_cha_settra	Settra, known by many godly titles such as Settra the Imperishable, the King of Kings, High King of Nehekhara, Lord of the Earth, Monarch of the Sky, Ruler of the Four Horizons, Mighty Lion of the Infinite Desert, Great Hawk of the Heavens, Majestic Emperor of the Shifting Sands, Eternal Sovereign of Khemri's legions, and so much more, is the mighty and absolute sovereign ruler of all Nehekhara, an ancient and powerful warrior-king who ruled a large and powerful Empire some two-thousand five hundred years before the birth of the Barbarian Hero Sigmar Heldenhammer and the founding of the Empire. Settra is as ruthless and tyrannical a ruler as can ever be, whose thirst for conquest and power is only matched by that of Nagash himself. His power is far greater than any other Tomb King, and his unyielding will is such that he never needs to return to his sarcophagus to rest. The immortality he lusted after in life is now his, and the civilisations that flourished in his absence will soon known the full wrath of he who founded the first.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh2_dlc09_tmb_cha_tomb_king	Tomb Kings are the ancient, long-dead rulers of Nehekhara. Their mummified corpses have been awakened by magical incantations, and their bodies are now inhabited by their undying, vengeful spirits. Reborn to a mocking imitation of life, transformed into hideous cadavers whose kingdoms have been plundered and lost, the Tomb Kings' rage fuels an unremitting need to conquer; they are the true monarchs of the dead, and they are coming to reclaim their rightful dominion. Revived by the rituals of the Liche Priests, a Tomb King awakens from the sleep of death possessing all the ambition and lust for power he had in life. Every Tomb King seeks to reclaim his plundered treasures and restore his ancient glory. If this means the subjugation and destruction of foreign lands, then his army, loyal even in death, rises from its rest at his command. Although it is the magic of the Liche Priests that animates the Tomb King's army, it is by the indomitable will of the Tomb King himself that they move and fight. Every Tomb King is an aggressive warlord, able to instil their warriors with their own unyielding vigour.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh2_dlc09_tmb_cha_tomb_prince	Each of the kings of ancient Nehekhara had many heirs, doubtless the result of their extensive harems, but only one could succeed their father to the throne. This was typically the second son of the king, for the firstborn were given to the gods to serve in the Mortuary Cult. The king's younger sons served as the generals and lieutenants of his armies and enforced his will over his subjects. Upon their deaths they were entombed beside the great tomb chamber of their sovereign, in an eternal council of war, waiting for the moment of awakening when they will resume command of their Undead legions.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh2_dlc09_tmb_inf_nehekhara_warriors	The Skeleton Warriors of Nehekhara are ancient and eternally loyal troops whom have willingly followed their mighty rulers unto death, forming the very core of all of the Tomb Kings' untold armies. Rising up from the dusty dunes, rank upon rank of these Skeleton Warriors stand ready to kill once more in the name of their immortal monarchs. Holding curved swords and long spears, ancient forms awake from their deathly slumbers, forming up in vast regiments with a supernatural discipline that few living warriors can hope to match. The mighty armies of Nehekhara, made up of regiment after regiment of valiant soldiers, swore oaths of eternal loyalty before the gods to serve their monarch in life and beyond into death.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh2_dlc09_tmb_inf_skeleton_archers	The Skeleton Archers of Nehekhara nock and loose volleys of arrows as they advance towards their foe without ever breaking stride. Raising their bows as one, the archers fire, reaching into quivers for another arrow before the first salvo has even reached the zenith of its trajectory. These Undead archers unleash great clouds of death that darken the sky moments before falling amidst the ranks of the enemy. Riders are pitched from mounts, and swathes of enemy infantry fall dead as bronze-tipped arrows rain down upon them and pierce their bodies. Skeleton Archers are unencumbered by the large, heavy shields of the Tomb King's other legions, allowing them the freedom needed to fire their long, curved bows. This leaves them with little protection against the swords and axes of their enemies, but any foe wishing them harm must first cross the killing ground, weathering a hailstorm of lethal arrows every step of the way. Only the most heavily armoured of foes can withstand such withering salvos. Less protected targets may instead turn and flee from the onslaught, but once an enemy has entered the sights of a Skeleton Archer, the Undead will not stop until their foes have been killed.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh2_dlc09_tmb_inf_skeleton_spearmen	The Skeleton Spearmen of Nehekhara are not mindless automatons slaved to the will of an evil necromancer. The incantations of the Liche Priests summon the spirits of long-dead soldiers from the Realm of Souls and bind them into corporeal forms. However, without the extensive mummification lavished upon their lords and betters, the spirits of these warriors do not retain the full memory of their former existence. Upon awakening from their death-sleep, the only things that every one of these Undead soldiers can recall with perfect clarity is their unswerving loyalty to their king and the ways of war that were drilled into them in life. Thus, the skeletal regiments of Nehekhara obey every command of their Tomb King without hesitation - as they served him in life, so they serve him in death.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh2_dlc09_tmb_inf_skeleton_warriors	The Skeleton Warriors of Nehekhara are ancient and eternally loyal troops whom have willingly followed their mighty rulers unto death, forming the very core of all of the Tomb Kings' untold armies. Rising up from the dusty dunes, rank upon rank of these Skeleton Warriors stand ready to kill once more in the name of their immortal monarchs. Holding curved swords and long spears, ancient forms awake from their deathly slumbers, forming up in vast regiments with a supernatural discipline that few living warriors can hope to match. The mighty armies of Nehekhara, made up of regiment after regiment of valiant soldiers, swore oaths of eternal loyalty before the gods to serve their monarch in life and beyond into death.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh2_dlc09_tmb_inf_tomb_guard	The Tomb Guard are the partially mummified remains of the king's elite guard. They are exceptional warriors, maintaining all the discipline and martial skill they had in life. In battle, the Tomb Guard form unwavering ranks of armoured warriors. They have spilled the blood of their enemies for countless centuries, and numerous armies have been dashed against their implacable shield wall. Although the Tomb Guard were rewarded with a form of mummification, the embalming rituals used were nowhere near as elaborate as the ceremonies that the Tomb Kings and Tomb Princes underwent. However, Tomb Guards have been reborn with immortal bodies far stronger and more resilient than the flesh and blood they had in life. Furthermore, Tomb Guards retain more of their former personalities than the massed soldiery of Skeleton Warriors. They awaken with memories of heroic deeds, bloody victories and the unyielding will to destroy their king's enemies still burning strongly in their mind. Above all they remember their duty to protect their Tomb King from harm, and any that threaten their charge are slain, cut down without pause.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh2_dlc09_tmb_mon_carrion	Carrion are terrifying Undead birds of prey that resemble giant, reanimated Vultures which feast upon the carcasses of those that have fallen within the lands of Nehekhara. Their broad wings, covered in feathers as black as midnight, darken the sky and spread the shadow of doom upon those dying in the desert. These Undead birds can smell blood from leagues away, and they are drawn to battlefields like moths to flame. Wherever Carrion are seen to fly, death and carnage are surely nearby. According to inscriptions, they were sacred beasts, agents of Ualatp, the vulture-headed God of Scavengers, who bore the spirits of lost warriors to the sky to fight in endless battles against the Daemons of darkness. This belief led to the Mortuary Cult burying corpses of Carrion in the necropolises, entombing many thousands within the pyramids of the Tomb Kings from the time of Nekhef I, who claimed to be the first ruler to use Carrion in his army of eternity and onwards. From these ancient corpses, the Carrion fly across the skies of Nehekhara to feast once more.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh2_dlc09_tmb_mon_heirotitan	A Hierotitan is a gigantic animated statue whose face is carved in the likeness of one of the Nehekharan deities of death. These idols radiate a sinister aura of magic, and it is said that those who stand within their shadow can hear the cruel laughter of ancient gods. Hierotitans were constructed to stand within the uppermost chambers of the Tomb Kings' burial pyramids. It was believed that they would act as spirit guides for the souls of deceased kings, responsible for ushering the eternal spirits of monarchs between the mortal world and the Realm of Souls. No expense was spared in sculpting a Hierotitan, a towering effigy whose form was lavished with gold and gems. In one hand, it carries an elaborate staff, known as the Icon of Ptra, which bears the hieroglyph of the sun god and lights the Hierotitan's path as it walks in the abyss that separates the mortal world from the Realm of Souls. This light wards away the evil spirits that dwell in the dark, Daemons who would otherwise prey on the souls of those wandering the void. The Hierotitan's other hand grasps a giant pair of scales, called the Scales of Usirian.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh2_dlc09_tmb_mon_necrosphinx	Necrosphinxes are nightmarish beasts of destruction that glide through the air in bounding leaps before falling amongst their terrified prey, scything down the living as mortals reap the wheat of the field. None can stand against such terrifying beings, and only when all before them have been butchered will they stop. A Necrosphinx is a bizarre and horrifying statue - a strange amalgamation of the mythical beasts that are said to inhabit the Nehekharan Underworld, maintaining order amongst the honoured dead. It has a torso and face of a man, and is armed with gigantic, scything blades that can sever the neck of a Dragon in a single slice. Many also have a scorpion-like tail, better enabling them to stand sentry against the predations of evil. Finally, sprouting from the statue's back are a pair of ornate wings which mimic those of the falcons that circle the highest levels of the Underworld, keeping watch so that the souls of the damned may not escape.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh2_dlc09_tmb_mon_sepulchral_stalkers	Sepulchral Stalkers are massive, reanimated sentinels created by the ancient Nehekharans to delineate the borders of a king's realm. Over the centuries, they have been swallowed by the shifting sands of the desert, and they now lie hidden beneath the dunes. Sepulchral Stalkers are statues that have the body of a snake and the upper torso of a man. Atop the statues' curved spines sit inhuman skulls, inside which glow eerie, baleful lights. Lying beneath the surface of the desert, they wait for intruders to pass by before launching a devastating ambush. When the trap is sprung, several horrifying, snake-like forms burst from the ground to surround their prey. The Sepulchral Stalkers impale their foes on ornate staves before they even realize they are under attack. However, it is not for the skill with which they wield these weapons that Sepulchral Stalkers are so feared, for those who gaze into their eyes are turned into pillars of sand, standing as still as statues until a gust of wind blows them apart and scatters the grains into the desert. To literally look upon a Sepulchral is to look to your own death.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh2_dlc09_tmb_mon_tomb_scorpion	Tomb Scorpions are powerful creations of the Mortuary Cult, formed from a combination of stone, metal, lacquered wood and fused bone. Burrowing beneath the surface of the desert, they attack suddenly and without warning, exploding into the fray in a shower of sand. They are lethal foes, for a Tomb Scorpion's tail carries a potent sting that can incapacitate the largest foes, and they have powerful pincers that can slice a man in half. As they scuttle forward on eight segmented legs, they hack apart anything in their path. When the Tomb Kings go to war, the Liche Priests send out their magical call and summon the Tomb Scorpions into wakefulness. Those Tomb Scorpions that respond to the incantations will travel for leagues beneath the ground before clawing their way to the surface and falling upon their enemies with razor-sharp claws and stinging tails. It is a truly terrifying sight to behold the sands parting to reveal the monstrous form of a Tomb Scorpion, and very often, last thing that their enemies will ever witness.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh2_dlc09_tmb_mon_ushabti	The Ushabti are large, guardian statues carved into the likeness of the gods and goddess of ancient Nehekhara, statues that stand guard and protect the perimeters of the necropolises and within the passageways of the great pyramids of the Tomb Kings. These Ushabti are imposing monuments to Nehekhara's former power, and all who pass through their shadows tremble under their unnerving and imposing sight. In times of need, the Liche Priests awaken the Ushabti with powerful incantations, and with the sound of cracking stone, the Ushabti step down from their plinths and daises, silent and ready for war. In ancient times, the living warriors of Nehekhara took great strength from the fact that the Ushabti fought alongside, for who could fail to be inspired by the physical representations of their gods marching into battle at their sides.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh2_dlc09_tmb_veh_khemrian_warsphinx	Khemrian Warsphinxes are giant leonine statues that wade through the ranks of their foes, crushing them underfoot as if they were nothing more than bothersome insects. Almost impervious to harm, their stone-hard hides protect them from all but the truest strikes; anything less than a direct hit from a war machine is likely to glance harmlessly away. Atop each Khemrian Warsphinx is an ornate howdah in which several Tomb Guards ride. These elite warriors direct their mount's actions as if it were an extension of their own mummified bodies, laying into the foes below with great, double-handed spears. Khemrian Warsphinxes are terrifying foes the face, and enemies that do not flee before them are swatted aside by stone claws or torn apart by fanged jaws. However, this is just a fraction of their full destructive power. When a Khemrian Warsphinx rears up above its prey, those lurking in its shadow are doomed. As the leonine monster crashes down, it smashes its boulder-sized limbs into the ground with appalling force. The resultant shockwave knocks foes off their feet, pulping organs and splintering bones. Those that survive this earth-shattering impact find themselves in a crater of broken, twisted bodies. However, there can be no hope for anything caught directly underneath the point of impact. All that remains of these crushed unfortunates is a fine, red mist that sprays over the victim's stunned comrades.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh2_dlc09_tmb_veh_skeleton_chariot	The pride of a Tomb King's army is his charioteer legions. Their advance is heralded by a cloud of dust thrown high in the air as they drive across the sands. Moments later, units of these deadly machines crest the dunes, their wheels whirring as they careen towards their foe. The legions impact with bone-shattering force, wave after wave of chariots crushing bodies beneath heavy wheels as their Undead crew lay about the disorientated foe with lethal effect. Ever since their invention, chariots have been the chosen means of transport for the kings of Nehekhara. Upon awakening from their deathly slumbers, the Tomb Kings continue to lead their armies to war from atop these ancient machines. Not only does a chariot have an armoured carriage to protect them from harm as they slay their foes, it also provides an elevated platform, granting the Undead monarchs a superior view of the battlefield, enabling them to better witness the movements of enemy fortifications and direct their own troops to inflict the most damage.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh2_dlc09_unit_long_text_skv_cha_tretch_craventail	Tretch began his rise from anonymity when his Clawpack was leading a long line of Night Goblins back to Crookback Mountain. Ostensibly, the Clawleader had chosen Tretch to carry key items of the scavenged loot as a reward for his idea to spike the Goblins' fungus beer, but it is more likely he was chosen because he was deemed too scrawny to usurp the Clawpack. This proved untrue, as Tretch used a small keg of distilled Mad Cap mushrooms, the stuff that turns Goblins into deranged, spinning lunatics, to great effect. With impeccable timing, Tretch turned his line of slaves into whirling death-dealers just as the Clawleaders and Chieftains were convening to argue over which tunnel to take. The effect of multiple Fanatics chained to each other and attempting to twirl madly in a packed tunnel was spectacularly bloody. After that incident the Clawpack needed a new leader and Tretch was first to scurry into the gap. Since those days, he has led countless ambushes and proven himself a master survivor. It was Tretch that found the hidden path to attach the flank of the Dwarf gunline at the Battle of Black Crag; Tretch who led the raid that tunnelled beneath the camp of mighty Black Orc Warlord Dagbad and every single Goblin out from underneath the Scourge of the Dark Lands; Tretch who was the only Skaven to escape the sinking of the Imperial Galleon captured on the River Aver. The detractors who jealously eye his rapid rise begin to get tail-twitchingly excited when they see Tretch's Clawpack flee the battle, wreathed in the fireball of a Weapons Team malfunction, or mauled by enemy formations. However, time after time, Tretch reappears, having left his doomed brethren and popped up elsewhere to accomplish some notable feat.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh2_dlc10_unit_long_text_def_cav_doomfire_warlocks_0	When Malekith first learned of the Prophecy of Demise, his initial wrathful blow fell against the Doomfire Warlocks of Hag Graef. Fearing their rebellion, the Witch King cursed them with hollowness, and their souls have teetered between the mortal world and the Realm of Chaos ever since. Thus, whilst other Elves fear Slaanesh as a potential fate, Doomfire Warlocks feel the Dark Prince's grasp on their souls grow with every passing day. As the grip tightens, dark runes blaze in to life on their flesh, an unholy fire that creeps slowly across the skin.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh2_dlc10_unit_long_text_def_cha_crone	Crone Hellebron is the most ancient of the Hag Queens and second only to Morathi in Khaine's sight. However, while the youth and beauty of Morathi never fades, Hellebron's is now almost expended, for the Hag Sorceress deliberately withheld from her the deepest secrets needed to use the Cauldrons of Blood. Therefore, ever more sacrifices are needed to fill Hellebron's cauldron each year, and yet the rejuvenating effects last for a smaller length of time on each occasion. Ugly and worn as she may be, Hellebron remains the greatest of the Brides of Khaine. Her mastery of the many ways of murder eclipses even that of Morathi - who is often too distracted by her sorcerous pursuits - and far outstrips the skills of the other Hag Queens. It is she who leads the Lord of Murder's unholy rites and dictates the holy creed that all Witch Elves must follow. She is so steeped in the ways of death that her merest touch can kill, and a single whispered word from her withered lips can open up old wounds to bloody life. Wherever Hellebron treads, the gaze of Khaine follows.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh2_dlc10_unit_long_text_def_cha_supreme_sorceress	Chief amongst the magic-wielders of Naggaroth are the sisters of the Dark Convent of Sorceresses, gathered in the great fortress of Ghrond. Competition for positions in the Dark Convent is bloody and fierce. Those that survive their sisters' ambitions learn some of the most powerful magic in the world. They can call upon ancient daemonic entities to devour their enemies, hurl storms of wicked shards at their foes or engulf them in dark energy. The Dark Magics of sorcery are but one of the disciplines studied by the Sorceresses of Ghrond, and they can call upon the Lores of Battle Magic with just as much skill as the stiff-souled mages of Ulthuan.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh2_dlc10_unit_long_text_def_inf_sisters_of_slaughter_0	The Sisters fight as they live, moment to moment, with every gut-spilling swipe and viper-quick slash unplanned until the second it is unleashed. Those who have not seen the Sisters of Slaughter at their quicksilver trade mock their talents, refusing to believe that mere instinct - however finely honed - could replace discipline and training. Such doubts last only until the naysayer witnesses a lone Sister hack her way through a trio of captured Daemons, or sees a handful of gladiatrixes fell a raging Chimera with an attack patter that is as sublimely artistic as it is impossible to predict.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh2_dlc10_unit_long_text_def_mon_feral_manticore_0	Dark Elves hold no creature in higher esteem than the Manticore, for they believe it to be one of the thousand incarnations of Khaine; daring Beastmasters venture as far north as the Chaos Wastes in search of young Manticores to sell at auction. Manticores can be tamed enough to take a rider, though they remain feral. Even if a steed occasionally ignores its rider's commands and pitches them into unfavourable fights, a Dark Elf considers this a minor risk compared to the fear and respect brought about by bringing a fearsome mount to the fray.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh2_dlc10_unit_long_text_def_mon_kharibdyss_0	The Kharibdyss is a loathsome beast of the uncharted depths, goaded to war by the Dark Elves. It is brutish and slow-witted at heart and simply rampages wherever hunger leads it. It is one of the most formidable weapons under Druchii command. Its slimy body, adapted to resist the pressures of the ocean, is unstoppable on land, possessing colossal strength and incredible fortitude. Smaller foes are simply swept into its maw by its crown of flailing tentacles. Larger foes are entangled and held fast whilst razor-sharp teeth feast upon their succulent flesh. 	false

unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh2_dlc10_unit_long_text_hef_cha_alarielle	Since the Golden Age, the Everqueen has served as Isha's chosen priestess in the mortal world. Whilst the tradition of the Phoenix King is relatively new, a mere six and a half thousand years in age, there has always been an Everqueen. Alarielle is the eleventh Everqueen to rule since the time of Aenarion. Her flowing hair is like a golden cloud, and it is said that so great and timeless is her beauty that it can move even the immortal gods to tears. The Everqueen's power is that of nature itself. Where Alarielle walks, the fields start to blossom and flowers spring forth from the ground. As a servant of light and nature, the Everqueen is opposed to corruption in all its forms. More importantly, her presence is anathema to tainted creatures of all kinds.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh2_dlc10_unit_long_text_hef_cha_alith_anar	Tradition maintains that the folk of Nagarythe chose Alith Anar as ruler after Malekith fled into the west. The Lord was the last heir of a great line, his forebears slain by the Witch King’s minions. In the following dark days there were many Druchii still hiding in Ulthuan, so Anar took to their eradication. Those not slain in battle were crucified upon trees - grisly monuments to the vengeance of Nagarythe’s Shadow King. He became a revenant who sought the death of every traitor-kin who dared live in the Sundering’s wake. Even now, thousands of years later, the Shadow King still hunts, and will not rest his bow until Malekith’s death.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh2_dlc10_unit_long_text_hef_cha_hand_of_the_shadow_crown	The Shadow Warriors, Alith Anar’s masters of irregular warfare, are the elite warriors of the Elven race. From among their number, the Shadow King raises up the greatest warrior with the greatest grasp of strategy and tactics to be his ‘hand’, who advises him and carries out his will with a furious precision. On those occasions where Alith Anar’s force must split into two, the Hand of the Shadow Crown leads the second contingent, bringing death to the Dark Elves with the same ruthless efficiency as his unswerving liege.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh2_dlc10_unit_long_text_hef_cha_handmaiden	Highest ranking of all the Sisters of Avelorn are the Handmaidens of the Everqueen. They are paragons of Elvenkind, as peerless in artistic pursuits as they are in the bloody business of battle. Should a Handmaiden grace the battlefield with her presence, she is treated with reverence by the High Elves that fight at her side. To serve as a Handmaiden is a great honour most commonly bestowed on those Sisters of Avelorn, who have proven their swiftness with blade, precision with bow and, above all, an unswerving loyalty to the Everqueen, many times over.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh2_dlc10_unit_long_text_hef_cha_shadow_walker_0	The Shadow Warriors, Alith Anar’s masters of irregular warfare, are the elite warriors of the Elven race.

unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh2_dlc10_unit_long_text_hef_inf_shadow_walkers_0	Bands of Shadow Warriors are often led by the most capable of their kin, known as Shadow-walkers. To reach the rank of Shadow-walker an Elf must have hundreds of years in the field under his cape and have proven to be utterly dedicated to Nagarythe’s cause. Compared to other High Elves, they are merciless, cold and callous - almost indistinguishable from the Druchii they hunt. They are unquestioningly loyal to their king, and as such, will form Alith Anar’s elite retinue on occasions when he is forced into open battle.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh2_dlc10_unit_long_text_hef_inf_shadow_warriors	The Shadow Warriors are masters of ambush and guerrilla warfare, and are elite warriors even among other Elves. They strike swiftly and noiselessly from concealment with deadly accurate volleys from their longbows, before charging forth to slay any survivors with a flurry of blades. Even at times when the populace of Ulthuan does not consider itself at war, there is no respite for the Shadow Warriors. Weary and grim, they constantly patrol the barren shores and bleakest hills of Nagarythe. They keep a constant vigil against approach of the evil Druchii who sank their homeland beneath the waves.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh2_dlc10_unit_long_text_hef_inf_sisters_of_avelorn_0	Sisters of Avelorn are keen-eyed archers, Elf maids chosen from the ranks of the citizen levy by the Everqueen's personal decree. By tradition, only the most gifted are welcomed into the Sisters of Avelorn for, just as the Everqueen embodies all that is ideal and unblemished in the Elven race, so too must her chosen guardians; not only in mind and body, but also in pursuit of the spiritual. Such measures serve to raise the warriors of the Maiden Guard above the petty intrigues that often pervade the Everqueen's court, ensuring that they remain incorruptible.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh2_dlc11_unit_long_text_cst_art_carronade	Many ships of the Undead fleets are equipped with broadside cannons known as Carronades or ‘smashers’, so named for the quick, splintering work they make of even the toughest ship hulls when brought within range. They first incapacitate their target before the zombie hordes board, murder, and loot according to their master’s will. As they sail off, another round of broadside cannon fire sends the ransacked ship and its blood-soaked decks to a watery grave. Carronades are comparable in size and power to the Great Cannons used in the field by the Empire, capable of causing a similar scale of devastation upon living targets and even reducing solid walls to rubble from afar. As with the armies of the Empire, Undead pirates drag their artillery onto the battlefield, with the hisses and cracks of smaller, handheld black powder weapons commonly preceded by the thundering booms of Carronade fire.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh2_dlc11_unit_long_text_cst_art_queen_bess	The infamous artillery piece known as Queen Bess is a monstrous cannon, so heavy and powerful that it requires constant maintenance due to the forces involved when firing it. Despite its cumbersomeness, its lethality makes it the pride and joy of any pirate fleet that manages to bring it into its possession, living or dead. The exact heritage of Queen Bess is uncertain, but it closely resembles a Hellhammer Cannon – a class of massive artillery originally designed by the mad alchemists of the Empire. Despite being utterly devastating, they were far too heavy to move on land – by mortals, at least – so ended up being used on Imperial Wargalleys. It is said that Luthor Harkon himself managed to steal one, refining and improving it in one of his more lucid moments to produce Queen Bess, one of the most powerful pieces of black powder artillery to ever grace a battlefield.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh2_dlc11_unit_long_text_cst_cav_deck_droppers	When Undead pirate fleets attack on the open ocean, the first thing their victims commonly see are the hideous, flying horrors known as Deck Droppers, appearing in advance of their masters’ ships to pepper enemies with bullets from above. A Deck Dropper comprises of a bloodthirsty Fell Bat and firearm-wielding zombie ‘rider’, or more accurately, a zombie being unwittingly suspended from the Fell Bat’s talons, slightly disorientated but not without the wherewithal to fire its hand cannon. Before an attack, the Fell Bats hang in a dormant state from the topmost spars high in the rigging of Undead fleets until stirred by the anticipation that the coppery tang of blood is about to fill the air. Diving amongst their own ranks to grab a zombie, they swoop above the bedlam of battle as their passenger uses their better vantage point to fire round after round into the groups of enemies below.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh2_dlc11_unit_long_text_cst_cha_aranessa_saltspite	Amongst the most feared of all the pirate captains of Sartosa is the Queen of Tides, Aranessa Anja Saltspite. Rumour has it that she is the daughter of the Sea-God Manann himself; that she rose fully grown out of the waves in a froth of gore, with seawater flowing through her veins instead of blood. To others, she is simply a mutant who cut off her own fishtail after being cast out of her Norscan tribe as a child. Whatever her origins may be, her skill at a ship’s helm or with a weapon in hand is such that none can dispute her lethality in a sea battle. Having absorbed all there is to know about the art of sailing over her lifetime, she now leads the crew of her mighty square-rigged galleon known as the Swordfysh, hunting down the wolf-ships of the Norscan fleets with a cold vengeance that makes even her own crew invoke the sign of Manann for protection.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh2_dlc11_unit_long_text_cst_cha_cylostra_direfin	Cylostra Direfin is the vengeful spirit who commands the Lamprey, a cursed ship that oft appears in the raging tempests of the open sea. Many decades ago, Cylostra was the favourite court singer of Bretonnian royalty, a prima donna of considerable size and temper who never accepted anything less than getting her own way. Cylostra was a passenger on the Lamprey during an important diplomatic voyage to perform for the Phoenix King. The galleon went down in a vicious storm, drowning everyone on board. As the Lamprey sank down beneath the waves, her futile, pitch-perfect notes turned to shrill, gurgled screaming. Those who know the legend of the ‘Siren of the Storm’ flee in terror at the sight of her ghostly, barnacle-strewn galleon, for it is said that when it appears, her songs of death paralyse all unfortunate enough to hear them, right before her Undead crew – the Drowned – appear to drag them down into a watery grave.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh2_dlc11_unit_long_text_cst_cha_fleet_admiral	The Vampires that lead the ranks of Undead mariners typically have centuries of experience. As long-living admirals, they can become a warship’s heart and soul – being Undead, however, those are two things they themselves lack. With the help of their Necromancy they are capable of impressive and sinister feats, driving their reanimated hordes forth in any confrontation, whether on land or at sea. The hiss of their orders can spur a crew to scramble and shamble to enact their master’s will and change the course of the warship – and perhaps, if the fates will it, the course of history. The first few Vampire Admirals were likely Sylvanian outcasts banished for one reason or another, or simply left Sylvania by their own accord after growing tired of the von Carsteins, enticed to take to the seas by the notorious successes of great Vampire Admirals such as Count Noctilus and Luthor Harkon.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh2_dlc11_unit_long_text_cst_cha_fleet_captain	Fleet Captains are not only formidable fighters armed with the finest equipment aboard their vessels, but are also powerful Vampires who use dark forms of magic to hurt their enemies or regenerate their Undead minions. Like their Vampire Admiral counterparts, some trace their origins back to Sylvania or were once seafaring swashbucklers who now fight in service of the Undead. Although typically associated with a Vampire Admiral, Fleet Captains are subordinate to no-one and are driven by the same base instincts as all other Vampires. Their immortality means they have had extensive time to hone their skills, making them feared combatants. In the swirling melee of battle they are first into the fray, often seeking out opponents to duel in single combat. As mayhem rages all around, the clank of their cursed cutlasses chime out as they surge forward – after all, to a bloodthirsty Vampire, there is no surer way to cripple the morale of an opposing crew than to leave their master dead and bleeding.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh2_dlc11_unit_long_text_cst_cha_gunnery_wight	As most Necromancers know, it is notoriously difficult to get a reanimated minion to use a firearm with any level of effectiveness due to their limited dexterity. Some men are so adept in the use of their weaponry during their lifetimes, however, that the Winds of Magic imprint those skills upon them so they may also manifest after death. The rifle-wielding Gunnery Wights are examples of this phenomenon, carefully animated from the corpses of high-ranking marksmen and artillerymen to be as obsessed with gunpowder in death as they were in life. Most were skilled mercenaries, part of the constant stream of brigands from the Empire, Kislev, and lawless places such the lands of the Border Princes, taking to the oceans in search of riches and adventure.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh2_dlc11_unit_long_text_cst_cha_luthor_harkon	The region of the New World known as the Vampire Coast owes its name to Luthor Harkon, a Vampire of unknown origins who established a realm on the northeastern stretch of the Lustrian shoreline after becoming stranded there many years ago. As leader of a pirate fleet crewed by the dead and the damned, he holds sway over a sea region proven to be incredibly treacherous to unwary vessels, swelling his horde of Undead mariners with shipwrecked unfortunates. While on a fateful quest to augment his might, he attempted to use Dark Magic to enter ancient chambers sealed with powerful glyphs, which retaliated and started to drain his lifeforce. Luthor managed to break free but the damage had been done – his connection to the Winds of Magic was severed and his mind shattered, leaving his personality fractured into a dozen different facets battling for dominance. In the years since, the only common goal that Luthor’s various personalities have been able to work towards is that of finding a cure for his condition, seizing the Lizardmen's artefacts in the hope that their power can heal his damaged psyche.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh2_dlc11_unit_long_text_cst_cha_mourngul_haunter	Mourngul Haunters are feared above all other dangers that haunt the bleak, empty places of the Old World. From the cold wastes of Norsca to the lofty heights of the Grey Mountains, dreadful tales are told around huddled fires of those lost in the white killing cold of mountain winters, driven mad by famine and pain, devouring their own companions and former friends for meat and the warmth of their fast-flowing blood. For these damned souls, there is no salvation. When bodily death overtakes the stranded and desperate, such is their anguish and malice that it lingers on, and the most destructive Winds of Magic are drawn to coil around their spirits to taint and saturate them. With their cadavers becoming warped and twisted into inhuman proportions, they transform into something neither ghost nor revenant – a monstrous, razor-thin shadow of cold, dead flesh and frostbite-cracked bone, with a gaping maw of needle-teeth and a cavernous stomach that hangs open like a dreadful wound.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh2_dlc11_unit_long_text_cst_cha_noctilus	The infamous admiral known as Count Noctilus is leader of the Dreadfleet – a malevolent gathering of Undead warship captains who bring ruin and damnation to living seafarers. As a former member of Sylvania’s aristocratic dynasty of Vampire Counts, he once went by the name Nyklaus von Carstein but had a markedly different vision from his squabbling peers of how he would achieve Necromantic supremacy. After studying the countless charts which map the ebb and flow of magic across the world, he realised that by mastering the art of seafaring he would be able to harness the magical gales that whirl and cascade across the oceans. This newfound route to power eventually led him to translocate himself and his Undead minions to the bone-choked morass of the Galleon’s Graveyard, a fell, sea-based realm of the Unliving between the tangible and intangible worlds which entraps the shipwrecked vessels of the world’s seas. It was in this mysterious place that Nyklaus von Carstein founded his darkling empire and renamed himself Count Noctilus.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh2_dlc11_unit_long_text_cst_damned	Many decades ago, Cylostra was the favourite court singer of Bretonnian royalty, a renowned performer for kings, rich nobles, and eminent stately guests. Her sense of self-importance could not be understated – whenever she travelled across the lands of chivalry to give her performances, she did so with a huge entourage made up of servants and attendants who would cater to her every whim. Part of this accompanying group were the unfortunate Knights and Paladins assigned to protect her on her travels, a job typically given as punishment for a misdeed or any unchivalrous behaviour that was not quite worthy of execution. Now long-dead, in life these formidable horsemen could not save Cylostra from her ultimate fate of drowning in the sinking Lamprey all those years ago, but her vengeful soul sometimes calls upon their spirits to return from the afterlife to serve her in the tangible world once more.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh2_dlc11_unit_long_text_cst_inf_deck_gunners	Clunky, cumbersome, and with bone-shattering recoil, it takes the heftiest of crewmen to operate the mounted swivel guns commonly seen mounted on the decks of warships and pirate ships of the world’s seas. In the field, they are seldom used by the armies of the living, since very few mortals possess the strength and bravery required to carry and use a firearm which for all its destructive advantages, is prone to explosive failure due to imperfect castings or poorly mixed black powder. For the zombies of the Undead pirate hordes, however, the prerequisites of bodily strength and bravery are no hindrance, since the reanimated possess supernatural motor functions and mindlessly carry out the will of their masters. So it is not uncommon to see Deck Gunners of zombie pirate crews haul their massive volley guns into a land confrontation in two-zombie teams, frenziedly firing directly into crowds of ill-fated victims.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh2_dlc11_unit_long_text_cst_inf_depth_guard	Depth Guard are the most feared soldiers of the zombie pirates’ fighting dead. Like their land-based counterparts, the Blood Knights, they are elite, Vampiric sentries clad in ancient, eldritch armour and bolstered by the Vampiric curse. Unlike the mobs of Undead crewmen, Depth Guard are not raised from the rabble who died on the oceans, and instead are hand-picked warriors who were given the Blood Kiss before being taken aboard pirate warships to serve their masters closely. The indefatigability of the Depth Guard means that any normal blow or bullet that strikes them has little chance of stopping them in a fight. They will trudge forward and fight unrelentingly until their bodily remains are utterly obliterated or their master’s control over them is broken.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh2_dlc11_unit_long_text_cst_inf_syreens	In the dark, dingy taverns of filthy, pirate-infested places like Sartosa, tales are told of the ethereal horrors that haunt the most cursed corners of the oceans. The Vampire Coast is the most notorious of such places, and around its perilous shores and rocky outcrops where many a galleon has met its end, there lurk the ghostly Syreens. With howls that can turn even the bravest men stark white, spearing their souls like a lance through the heart and causing them to die of shock, they are like the Tomb Banshees of the Old World – tortured souls of evil Sorceresses who fear crossing the void to face whatever punishment awaits them for their malevolence. A single Syreen is a horrific thing to encounter, but it is not unheard of for the Necromantic Lords of the sea to bind them into terrifying groups to serve their nefarious purposes.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh2_dlc11_unit_long_text_cst_inf_zombie_deckhands	Reanimated from corpses of drowned seaman and other unfortunates who perish at sea, Zombie Deckhands serve the eldritch admirals of the world’s oceans to make up the bulk of Undead pirate hordes. Festooned with rusty and corroded cutlasses and polearms, they are controlled with dread enchantments which enable them to be competent as crewmen as well as fighters, making them ideal for piracy. As with all warriors reanimated from the dead, however, they tend to be clumsy combatants, with their advantages mostly being in the fact they have no will of their own so will continue moving forward regardless of injury or futile odds. Nevertheless, the tempestuousness of the Winds of Magic that blow across world’s oceans means that despite their apparent mindlessness, some vicious spark of personality resides deep within the Deckhands’ rotten souls, making them all the more formidable in combat.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh2_dlc11_unit_long_text_cst_inf_zombie_gunnery_mob	Zombies are clumsy, drudge-like combatants, so more potent forms of magic are usually required to give them the dexterity required to operate firearms. Fortunately for seafaring Necromancers, all those who perish on the ocean are touched by the powerful magic of Galleon’s Graveyard – an oceanic realm of the Unliving that exists between the tangible and intangible worlds, sucking in the world’s shipwrecked vessels and the drowned corpses of their passengers and crews. The weapons of those reanimated from the depths may be rusted and sodden, but many zombies cling to the guns they held so dearly in life and use them with additional help from residual muscle memory. Wielding a shabby collection of black powder weapons long past their best, the Zombie Pirate Gunnery Mob appear to gain a small spark of the satisfaction they enjoyed in life through the random discharge of noisy, indiscriminate firepower.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh2_dlc11_unit_long_text_cst_mon_animated_hulks	An Ogre risen from the dead is amongst the most powerful of minions a Necromancer can control, and a most terrifying abomination to face in battle. The nomadic brutes sometimes take passage aboard ocean-going vessels on their worldly travels, but most are too dim-witted to understand the risk the ocean poses to them, since their dense bellies and hulking frames make them some of the worst swimmers in existence. Whether an Ogre dies by drowning or meets its end by some other means at sea, once its massive, waterlogged corpse spends a prolonged period floating in the briny water it becomes invaluable to seafaring Necromancers. Attributed to the mysterious effects of Galleon’s Graveyard which touches everything that perishes at sea, the reanimation process applied to dead Ogres often yields unpredictable results, sometimes amalgamating their huge bodies with ship parts, or even sprouting limbs and additional heads of hideous sea monsters.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh2_dlc11_unit_long_text_cst_mon_bloated_corpse	A troop of zombie pirates is as macabre a sight as any Necromancer’s ghostly, rotting horde. The bodies of those brought back into existence as Unliving automatons continue to rot once they are reanimated, so Necromantic admirals tend to raise crewmen from the freshest victims possible. Sometimes a corpse may have spent weeks floating in the ocean before it is raised, however, becoming swollen with noxious gases over time, its tissues seeping from rotten and tattered skin which blisters and turns to a greenish hue. In reanimating such a grotesquery to fight in their horde, a Lord essentially has a walking time bomb in their ranks, and a volatile one at that. It is far preferable to fight against such a creature at a distance, for when attacked, their tortured forms may suddenly disintegrate in a poisonous shower of decomposing internal organs and diseased fluids.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh2_dlc11_unit_long_text_cst_mon_mournguls	Travellers, hunters, and outcasts unlucky enough to get lost and endure slow starvation amongst the killing cold of mountain winters risk exposure to the most insidious effects of the Winds of Magic. Even the most steadfast men can turn into monstrous shells of themselves known as Mournguls – insatiable, razor-thin creatures of frostbite-cracked bone who dwell in the high, chill barrens feasting upon all who encounter them. Considered neither living nor dead, it is notoriously difficult to subjugate these ghastly spectres, but some who undergo the twisted transformation are forced into enslavement by those with the right Necromantic knowledge. When the Winds surge and arcane storms scream across the world, powerful binding scrolls can be fashioned to exert control over the walking nightmares, making it possible to create small bands of lesser Mournguls to do one's bidding. Such creatures are less autonomous, but no less ravenous or able to kill.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh2_dlc11_unit_long_text_cst_mon_necrofex_colossus	The unhallowed form of the Necrofex Colossus is one of the most terrifying anathema known to arcane lore. Varying in composition, they always hold true to the same basic form – a monstrous humanoid shape akin to a giant, fashioned upon a frame of galley-torn timber, iron, or bone, onto which the ‘flesh’ and musculature of the dead has been bound and shaped, with scores of corpses used in their creation. These gargantuan monstrosities fear neither pain nor injury, for they are walking vortexes of deathly energies around which the souls of the damned howl and against which few mortals can stand. With so much unholy power concentrated in their forms, a Necrofex Colossus is no mere mindless thrall, but possesses a deathly will and dark appetite of its own, often outlasting its creator or even proving their undoing should its master’s control slip even for a moment.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh2_dlc11_unit_long_text_cst_mon_rotting_leviathan	A living Leviathan is truly a sight to behold. With the appearance of an immense crab typically measuring at least thirty feet across, its seaweed-strewn carapace is said to be as strong as steel. With beady eyes searching upon stunted stalks, it hunts for prey to grab with its claws and shove into its gaping maw. Although there was once a cult dedicated to worshipping them, Leviathans are thought not to be creatures of Chaos, just naturally destructive ones. Scholars believe that the few which exist live on the deepest sea floors, only ever rising to the surface to wreak havoc on passing galleons. In any case, it is notoriously difficult to control a living Leviathan – only once felled and killed can a Necromancer hope to bring one under their command with the appropriate incantations, a feat only achievable by the most learned magic-users.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh2_dlc11_unit_long_text_cst_mon_rotting_prometheans	There are many wondrous and dangerous creatures that dwell beneath the world's waves. From fire-breathing Sea Dragons to the ravaging Kraken of the Great Ocean, the sea’s bounty is truly as varied as that of land-going life. Once dead, however, even the most belligerent creatures become infinitely more controllable to the seafaring Necromancers that terrorise the oceans. The Lustrian coastline is home to many such useful sea monsters, including the crab-like Prometheans which scuttle across the more shallower regions of the continent’s surrounding ocean floors. Standing as tall as fully-grown men, and with pincers that can dismember a man like giant scissors, they are distant cousins of the much larger and rarer Leviathans. Being relatively common in their known habitats, Prometheans are often targeted by Undead pirate fleets to be killed, reanimated, and brought into their fighting ranks, either as mounts or as monstrous combatants in their own right.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh2_dlc11_unit_long_text_cst_mon_scurvy_dogs	Scurvy Dogs are vicious, Unliving beasts, herded into rabid packs by Undead pirates for use in their midnight raids. Most were wild strays from the filthy hovels of Sartosa, taken pity upon by drunken pirates and brought aboard ships as affectionate, if somewhat noisome companions. They are kept in a vicious state through pit fighting, entertaining the crewmen during the occasional prolonged periods of inaction. The dogs are rarely allowed to fight each other all the way through to death or crippling injury, however – their murderous abilities are saved for raids and boarding actions – but the accumulation of scars enhances their menacing appearance, making them ideal raiding companions who serve their masters beyond the death of both. As reanimated pets, they are much less affectionate and a whole lot more noisome, not that a bite from a Scurvy Dog is anything for an Undead pirate to worry about!	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh2_dlc11_unit_long_text_cst_mon_terrorgheist	Amongst the impassably jagged rocks of the world’s most inhospitable ocean shorelines, the flying scourges of the sea known as Death Shriek Terrorgheists make their homes within hidden caves. Like their Sylvanian equivalents, they are titanic, Dragon-sized bats that can only be controlled by Necromantic means once killed, which is no easy feat to begin with. All Terrorgheists are ambush hunters, but the marine varieties are set apart from their land-haunting cousins by the difference in their habitat. The lack of land features which would usually facilitate the Terrorgheist’s element of surprise has resulted in it adapting its Death Shriek to be a much more powerful weapon. With a piercing scream that paralyses the passengers and crew of any ship it encounters, it swoops down to gather its prey directly from the decks, scooping them up within its talons before returning to its lair to glut itself on warm blood.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh2_dlc11_unit_long_text_cst_sartosa_free_company	The 'Decadent Pirate Principality of Sartosa', known more politely by its swashbuckling inhabitants as the 'Free City of Sartosa' or simply the 'City of Pirates', is an anarchic pirate island-stronghold located on the southern reaches of war-torn Tilea, off the coast of the Tilean city-state of Luccini. A notorious haven for criminals, it harbours all manner of pirates, brigands, lawless mercenaries - anyone wanting to avoid the various legitimate powers of the Old World. It is a tremendously dangerous place, where drunken pirates press-gang unsuspecting individuals, brawls and duels are an hourly occurrence, and thieves ply the dirty, crowded docks looking for easy marks. Despite the risks, however, it is a place where someone with the toughness and willpower to survive can not only live but thrive, far from the yoke of unfair taxes, overbearing noblemen, and stringent laws. From Sartosa to Araby in the south, the Border Princes to the east, and the mainland past the Great Ocean, exotic lands await. In short, Sartosa is a perfect place for finding fame, plunder and endless adventure!	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh2_dlc11_unit_long_text_def_cha_lokhir_fellheart	Some Dark Elves take to the seas in search of plunder or revenge, but many more do so to escape the dangers of Naggaroth. Not so Lokhir Fellheart, who was born to ply the rolling seas, bringing fire and terror to foreign shores. Putting to the sword any target he sets his attention to, Fellheart is the latest in a line of doom-bringing admirals to have commanded the formidable Black Ark known as 'Tower of the Blessed Dread', leaving countless ports and coastal cities ruined and ablaze in his wake. His deeds have not only earned him more glory than that of all his forbears combined, but also wealth beyond measure – slaves and treasure flow into Karond Kar as never before, earning him the grudging respect, if not quite the loyalty, of the city’s masters. The best plunder he keeps, but there is always plenty more for lavish rewards and bribes.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh2_dlc12_unit_long_text_lzd_cav_ripperdactyl_riders	Ripperdactyl Riders are amongst the most fearsome warriors to ever soar across the skies of Lustria. Though Skinks found training Terradons relatively easy, turning Ripperdactyls into sky mounts proved far more difficult. While sustaining many losses, Skinks learned that hatched Ripperdactyls could be bonded with and trained, assuming they weren't eaten alive as soon as the ravenous creature hatched. Skinks who survive bonding with their Ripperdactyls are bold, elite warriors. Once mounted atop their mounts, they forego javelins and blowpipes, for their blood-hungry beasts cannot be stopped from plunging down upon foes. The razor-sharp talons of a Ripperdactyl can decapitate foes — their furious attacks leaving strewn innards and lopped-off limbs behind them.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh2_dlc12_unit_long_text_lzd_cha_skink_chief_red_crested	Within Lizardmen society, the quick-witted, swift-moving Skinks are the administrators and craftsmen – the workers, you might say. As is common among the Slann, certain spawnings are – for reasons unclear – faster, stronger, sharper and brighter than their peers. Such is the case of the Red Crested Skinks, who first emerged at the temple-city of Chaqua before it was attacked and overrun by a particularly vicious horde of plague-bearing Skaven, and it was the Red Crested Skinks who subsequently heeded Tehenhauin’s call and flocked to the Prophet’s banner in service of the coming Serpent-God, Sotek. As the survivors of the slaughter and the plague that followed it fanned out across Lustria, they brought word of the Prophecy of Sotek to all Lizardmen, urging them on to total war against Skavenkind and proclaiming that the sacrifice of any rat spawn would invoke the Serpent-God and hasten his blessed arrival.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh2_dlc12_unit_long_text_lzd_cha_tehenhauin	The greatest of the Red Crested Skinks, Tehenhauin has a zeal for slaughtering Skaven very rarely seen among the ranks of the dispassionate Lizardmen. It seems impossible for a short-lived Skink to attain such a lifespan, but it is whispered that as a snake sheds its skin and is renewed, so too does Sotek’s Chosen. On the battlefield, he triumphantly grasps the Plaque of Sotek as he leads his apostles into the fray, commonly attacking in the manner of his twin-tailed deity: forked assaults. A serpent strikes quickly and so too does Tehenhauin, focusing his army’s venomous energy on the enemy’s weak points. 	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh2_dlc12_unit_long_text_lzd_cha_tiktaqto	The cagey but death-defying Skink Chief known as Tiktaq’to has proven himself peerless when it comes to aerial combat and leading bold hit-and-run attacks from the sky, leading his squadron from atop his Terradon, Zwup; a keen sense of when and where to strike has led TikiTaq’to to countless victories against forces many times greater than his own. Those among his foes who know his reputation attempt to shoot his force out of the air as soon as they come within range – a feat easier said than done, since the Master of Skies leads his formations in such breath-taking aerial manoeuvres that they can evade clouds of arrows and emerge unscathed to deliver their own lethal attacks.	false

unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh2_dlc12_unit_long_text_lzd_lzd_cha_kroak	Lord Kroak may have been the eldest of the fabled First Generation. The mysterious Old Ones taught Kroak about the Winds of Magic and shared the secrets to unwinding time’s delicate threads. So ancient are they that it was Kroak and his peers who taught the first Elves to wield magic. These things and more has Kroak seen; he is fated to endure until the universe’s very last moment. Making the most profound of sacrifices during the Great Catastrophe, his indomitable spirit simply would not concede defeat. In the wake of Itza’s defence, Kroak’s loyal Skink attendants lamented their master’s death. His body was scattered far and wide, so they diligently collected every last scrap of that ravaged body and, with great reverence, the remains were swathed in resin-soaked wrappings; thus was created the first Relic Priest…	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh2_dlc12_unit_long_text_lzd_mon_salamanders	Salamanders are giant, predatory reptiles that stalk the swamplands and estuaries of the Lustrian jungles. Propelled by four thickly-muscled legs and a powerful tail, they are fast-moving creatures whether on land or in water. Once within range of their prey, they launch a burst of highly-corrosive liquid from their gullets, a substance so volatile that it bursts into flames upon contact with the air! The burning pitch-like substance sticks to victims, burning them alive and beginning the digestive process. The creatures' neck-frills and back sails provide a cooling mechanism, ensuring the cold-blooded creatures do not expire in the heat generated from their own bodies.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh2_dlc12_unit_long_text_skv_cha_ikit_claw	Chief Warlock Ikit Claw has taken Skryre’s blend of science and sorcery to entirely new levels. He was tall and white-furred before a failed experiment exploded and mangled his body, so an intricate iron mask of his own invention now covers his hairless skull and a cunningly wrought exoskeleton aids his withered left side. The iron contraption is run by a Warp-generator, a masterpiece of engineering that siphons the Winds of Magic to also power Ikit’s devilish inventions. Whirring cogs hiss and vent steam as the Chief Warlock moves, clanking like a fully armoured knight. Like all Clan Skryre Warlock Engineers, Ikit has continued to tinker, adding countless upgrades. He wields the crackling blade Storm Daemon, a modified halberd wrapped with copper wire coils set with glowing Warpstone, energised with barely suppressed power drawn from his Warp-generator.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh2_dlc12_unit_long_text_skv_cha_warlock_master	The Warlock Engineers of Clan Skryre are perhaps the most ingenious minds in all Skavendom; insane, diabolical scientists who combine arcane sorcery with mad science to create some of the the greatest technological marvels of mayhemic destruction. They are the artificers of Skaven society, producing black-market weaponry for any able to pay for it. Under the ever-watchful eyes of their Warlock Masters, whose role it is to oversee and, well, steal any credit that may be due, Warlock Engineers are the very pinnacle of Skaven technomancy. They combine well-known weapons with heavy armour to make highly-experimental devices which do not always function flawlessly - many have met their doom as the result of an exploding Warp-power accumulator!	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh2_dlc12_unit_long_text_skv_inf_ratling_gun	The Ratling Gun is perhaps the most powerful weapon Clan Skryre has ever invented, a large, multi-barrelled death-dealing machine with the potential to change the very face of warfare in the Skaven's favour. Though a relatively new and often unreliable design, the gun has nonetheless proven itself so successful that Clan Skryre simply cannot make enough to satisfy Warlord Clans' greedy demands. Powered by Warp-steam and the prodigious working of a hand crank, the six-barrelled Ratling Gun starts to spin before unleashing its deadly payload of Warpstone bullets. Commonly, the gun requires two Skaven; one to hold and crank the Warp-steam while another aims the gun forward.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh2_dlc12_unit_long_text_skv_inf_warplock_jezzails	Warplock Jezzails are specialised teams of marksmen bearing weaponry of the same name - long-barrelled muskets requiring a two-rat Skaven team to fire and reload. This is because their barrels are extraordinarily long, giving them the capability of hitting targets at far greater distances than conventional bows or black powder firearms. When fired, a single bullet made of refined toxic Warpstone is unleashed, striking with a force capable of penetrating even the thickest armour. The bullets leave a faint green vapour trail in the air, which generally exposes the team to enemy fire. For this reason, a protective pavise shield, designed to screen themselves from retaliatory arrows, bolts and bullets, is also carried.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh2_dlc12_unit_long_text_skv_veh_doom_flayer	The Doom-Flayer is a motorised iron ball of whirling blades that was first deployed during the merciless underground battles against the Dwarfs of the World's Edge Mountains. Various incarnations of this Skaven killing machine with spinning, stabbing and slashing blades were used to assail the Dawi's subterranean strongholds. The first few Doom-Flayers were largely Skaven-powered, as the pushing crew generated much of the impetus needed to drive the whirling weaponry. The Skaven crew, protected by a scrap-barrier of old shields, metal-reinforced planks, and even the patched-together armour plates of fallen enemies, could just about avoid incoming missile fire and steer the device to plough into enemy lines.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh2_dlc13_unit_long_text_emp_archers	Archers have been fielded by the Empire since time immemorial. Archer units are often irregular bands of hunters and trappers grouped together to form their own regiments, ready to answer the call to arms at any given moment, where their tracking, scouting, and advanced archery skills will be put to best use. Armed with bows and swords, these warriors are adept at luring their quarry into lethal ambushes so the full might of an Imperial army can utterly destroy them. Archers are adaptable, often forming a loose skirmish screen before falling back behind their army’s ranks when the enemy approaches.	false

As a young doctor he used his gift for medicine to save countless lives in a budding career as a highly-skilled surgeon.\\n\\nThe van Hal surname marks him as being part of a renowned lineage of Witch Hunters. Curiously, Hertwig himself shuns the association with his ancestry, considering the shame of their progenitor Baron Frederick van Hal to be too much to accept. In a previous age, the evil baron had been an extremely powerful and notorious Necromancer associated with Vlad von Carstein. Frederick's terrible acts at the command of vast armies of the Undead compelled many of his descendants to take the Witch Hunter oath to atone for his sins.\\n\\nNot all those descendants fulfil that destiny as a choice, however. Hertwig’s own path into the unyielding role of a van Hal Witch Hunter is a journey that has taken him from bustle of Altdorf to the tropical danger of Lustria.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh2_dlc13_unit_long_text_emp_cha_hunter_jorek_grimm	The Master Engineer known as Jorek Grimm is a secretive individual who lives amongst the Spine of Sotek Dwarfs of southwest Lustria. Not much is known about him other than the fact that he frequently goes on solo forays into the Lustrian jungle using advanced, custom-built equipment to survive in what is an extremely hostile environment for anyone, let alone a Dwarf. He is eccentric – even by Dwarfen standards – but brilliant, with most of his devices being one-of-a-kind, designed and assembled himself. Like many Dwarfs, he seems to carry a heavy burden from his past which he refuses to talk about.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh2_dlc13_unit_long_text_emp_cha_hunter_kalara	Kalara is the paradigmatic Waystalker; solitary and at ease in the wild, be it the enchanted forests of Athel Loren or the entangled jungle canopies of Lustria. Her skill with a bow is matched by very few, for she possesses an ability to find a target’s weak points with frightening, supernatural aptitude. As with all Waystalkers, she shuns sedentary society and chooses to constantly prowl her hunting grounds. Despite her melancholy demeanour, Kalara is a savage huntress who stalks her prey with unrelenting steadfastness and courage. She seems to have a thirst for hunting that consumes her – after all, not many would willingly choose the untamed lands of Lustria for their hunting grounds. Kalara is just as equipped for taking on the continent’s beasts as anyone, however.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh2_dlc13_unit_long_text_emp_cha_hunter_rodrik_l_anguille	The Bretonnian swordsman Rodrik l’Anguille may have the appearance of a Questing Knight, but his disposition is that of a downtrodden man with a complicated history. His escapades prior to his arrival in Lustria are unknown, but like all Paladins he must have proven himself with a great feat of arms at some point in the past. Against all the odds, he survived a doomed foray into the treasure-seeker’s death trap that is Xlanhuapec, though at the great cost of losing his entire retinue. Regardless of how little is known of his past, Rodrik has survived for months alone in the Lustrian jungle, where others would barely survive for hours, marking him out as a most resilient soldier indeed.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh2_dlc13_unit_long_text_emp_crossbowmen_ror	State troops are paid as full-time professional soldiers, ready to answer the call to arms at all times. In addition to forming a standing army to repel enemy attack, they also serve as city guards, the fire watch and the enforcers of the law. However, most of the time these soldiers spend their days drilling and training with various weapons to the barked instructions of grim-faced, veterans. Each Imperial state trains its regiments to fight together on the battlefield, so Imperial armies often march to battle with detachments of missile troops to aid them.

unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh2_dlc13_unit_long_text_emp_deathjacks_archers	The Deathjacks, renowed archers who can track a foe at speed through any forest, were initially hired to scout ahead of the Stirland army during the civil war of the Three Emperors. Since then, they have continued to fight in Imperial service, ambushing opposing scouts and finding hidden paths from which to catch the foe unaware. Used to fending for themselves, they are dubbed “mutton-stickers” or “thievingjacks” by their own comrades, as supplies mysteriously go missing whenever the Deathjacks are around. All is forgiven, however, when they return from a scouting mission, waving their banner to signify enemies ahead or blaring the all-clear on their hunting horns.	false

These men are equipped with two-handed swords called 'zweihanders' that can cleave an armoured Knight in twain with one blow. Greatswords wear Dwarf-forged plate armour, for they are expected to fight in the thick of the bloodiest, most dangerous situations. Upon induction into the Greatswords' esteemed ranks, members must swear an oath never to take a backwards step in the face of the enemy. Each regiment has its own particular punishment for those who do, but instances of such dereliction are extremely rare. In fact, Imperial history is peppered with tales of Greatswords killed protecting their lords even after the rest of their army had been butchered.	false

Originally from the village of Drakenburg, situated within the deep dark forest of the Middenland province, Markus has risen to be the Emperor’s Captain of Scouts as well as the leader of his own band of monster hunters. Wulfhart's Hunters, as they call themselves, are an elite, rag-tag group of trappers, hunters, archers and scouts from all across the Empire.

unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh2_dlc13_unit_long_text_emp_mortar_ror	Mortars are short, heavy weapons, designed to lob a hollow, explosive shell high into the air so that it drops onto its target. While a solid cannon ball may plough through several victims, a Mortar shell explodes with tremendous force, scattering razor-sharp shrapnel over a wide area and scything through whole ranks of enemy warriors. Firing a Mortar is always a tense moment, for the quality of fuses is highly variable and it is not unknown for one to burn through before the crew have finished loading the shell. As a result, Mortar crews tend to be superstitious and carry multiple good-luck charms about their persons.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh2_dlc13_unit_long_text_emp_outriders_ror	Outriders are both the commanders and drill instructors of the Pistolkorps. They are rarely noblemen, but usually veterans elevated from the ranks of state regiments who have shown an affinity for horsemanship and a talent for training new recruits. Outriders typically wear ornate armour, for nobles pay well for their sons to learn the art of war. They tend to form separate regiments to show their charges exactly how it's done, but also to display their martial skills to any noble looking for an experienced instructor to tutor their sons. As the Pistolkorps is funded in part by the Imperial Engineers School, Outriders are equipped with deadly repeater handguns, capable of unleashing devastating storms of lead at range. The Outriders' leader, inevitably the keenest among them, will often be armed with an even more outlandish weapon befitting his status.	false

Some spirited young nobles may gather their friends and form regiments of Pistoliers of their own, but most join the Pistolkorps, a military organisation funded by the Emperor, the Engineers' School and several Knightly Orders. Here, young nobles learn about horsemanship and war from grizzled veterans.

And so it has been, for Gor-Rok has fought countless battles, his heavily-scarred body a testament to myriad hard-won triumphs. He is the mightiest of warriors, the solid centre around which the Saurus battlelines advance and the rock upon which Itza’s enemies are broken.

unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh2_dlc13_unit_long_text_lzd_razordon_hunting_pack_ror	Razordons are a species of predatory reptile covered with an array of large hardened spikes made from bone that project menacingly. As a defensive protection, this razor-sharp body armour serves to deter all but the most determined of creatures, and even the most monstrous of Lustria’s many apex predators will think twice before attacking a Razordon. The Razordon’s spines are not only a deterrent, however, they are also a deadly offensive weapon. By way of powerful muscle spasms, their spines can be discharged, shooting outwards in a deadly hail.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh2_dlc13_unit_long_text_lzd_sacred_kroxigor	Kroxigor form one of the core species of the Lizardmen race, created by the Old Ones to be strong, obedient construction workers, labourers and powerful warriors. In all practicality, they are essentially a larger and far more powerful relative of the Saurus. Hulking creatures, their bodies consist of slabs of rock-hard muscle and their massive jaws bristle with razor-sharp teeth. They move in silence, save for the heavy thumping tread of their feet. When enraged, they unleash their only form of speech — a blood-curdling roar that reverberates across the jungle.	false

unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh2_dlc14_skv_inf_death_runners_ror_0	Death Runners are among the elite of Clan Eshin, standing between the Gutter Runners and Assassins in rank. Most suspicious deaths and acts of espionage in Skaven society are blamed on the nefarious Clan Eshin. Such accusations are probably true, but of course there is no evidence. Much of this devastation is wrought by the Gutter Runners, Clan Eshin's black-clad death squads. Death Runners are the elite among their ranks, having excelled at the mysterious Far Eastern fighting styles for which Gutter Runners are known and demonstrated enough wherewithal and self-determination to lead. Because of their ability to bend and contort their pliable bodies with a speed and dexterity unachievable by man, Death Runners have no need for encumbering armour – they simply dodge the blows and missile of their foes.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh2_dlc14_unit_long_text_brt_cha_repanse_de_lyonesse	Repanse was born in 1990 IC and grew up as a humble and devoutly religious shepherdess in Lyonesse. In 2007 IC, a Chaos horde invaded, besieged the city of Couronne and slew King Louis the Brave as he fought in its defence. Chaos raiders soon spread out across the land, burning and destroying. At this dark moment, amid the smoking ruins of her own village, Repanse saw the Lady of the Lake, who told her to rid the land of these invading forces. Repanse donned armour from a slain Knight, grabbed the reins of a terrified warhorse, then broke open the reliquary of the village Grail Chapel and took up its ancient sword. Snatching a tapestry with the Fleur de Lys to use as a banner, she rode forth to rally the disheartened Knights of Lyonesse. When the Knights saw a mere Damsel bravely setting off to do battle with the mighty Warriors of Chaos, they were shamed and felt honour-bound to follow her to death or glory. That day, Couronne was saved and the enemy were pursued to the sea and justly put to death. In gratitude, King Louis the Young bestowed upon Repanse not only all the honours of Knighthood, but also the dukedom of Lyonesse.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh2_dlc14_unit_long_text_def_cha_high_beastmaster	The Beastmasters of Clar Karond and Karond Kar can command even the wildest creatures to do their bidding. In part, this mastery springs from their unflinching dedication to the tormentor's craft, but brutality alone would be worthless without a Beastmaster's innate empathy. All Elves share a mystical attunement with the natural world, but while most embrace this bond to gain greater wisdom and fellowship with other living creatures, Dark Elves, and Beastmasters in particular, employ it as another weapon in their arsenal of torment. It matters not whether the beast is a raging Manticore, a cunning Harpy, or the wisest of all Caledor's ancient Dragons: eventually, all submit to the Beastmaster's will, or perish under his lash.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh2_dlc14_unit_long_text_def_cha_malus_darkblade	Malus Darkblade, the Tyrant of Hag Graef, was always ambitious, even by the lofty standards of Hag Graef's warring families. For long years, he played the deadly game of politics and assassination and played it well, but finally Malus' thirst for power set him on a quest that led him deep into the Realm of Chaos. It is a testament to his determination that he not only survived his journey, but at last arrived at the temple of Kul Hadar. Alas for Darkblade, the great power within the temple was something not easily bent to mortal will. Centuries before, the Daemon Tz'arkan had been bound within Kul Hadar, and Darkblade now unwittingly allowed it to escape. Blinded by avarice, Malus was possessed by the Daemon. In that instant, his life and soul were forfeit. There is but one way to escape his fate – to find five artefacts of power to fully free Tz'arkan and restore Darkblade's soul. Failure, of course, would mean remaining in the Daemon's thrall for eternity.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh2_dlc14_unit_long_text_def_cha_master	Dark Elf Masters are the nobles of Druchii society. However, theirs is a ladder with very greasy rungs, and more nobles perish in the climb than ever reach the heady heights of becoming a Dreadlord. To alleviate the understandable paranoia engendered by the Dark Elves' treacherous society, a rigid code of etiquette has evolved. The lowborn classes may not approach within three sword lengths of a noble without being summoned. A retainer may stand as close as two sword lengths whilst a trusted retainer, such as a bodyguard, may stand just outside a single sword's length. The closest, most intimate space is reserved for lovers, playthings and mortal foes (the latter being far more trustworthy within reach than not).	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh2_dlc14_unit_long_text_def_mon_bloodwrack_medusa	Bloodwrack Medusae are horrid half-snake creatures that have served the whim and desires of Morathi, the Hag Queen of Naggaroth for many thousands of years. It is said that they were Sorceresses of Ghrond who used their magics and blood-feasting rituals to become more beautiful than even the gods. In so doing, they came to the attention of the goddess Atharti, Goddess of Pleasure, who is vain beyond measure and suffers no mortal competition. In retribution, she stripped the upstart mortals of their beauteous forms and caged them in pain-wracked, serpentine bodies. Even this punishment she deemed insufficient, and so reduced their minds to be little more than those of beasts. Atharti left only one sliver of awareness in her victims, enough that they might always remember with torment the beauty and power they had once possessed.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh2_dlc14_unit_long_text_def_mon_harpies_ror	Harpies are rare winged predators almost entirely unknown in the Old World. They make their lairs in the mountains and cliffs near the sea, where prey is more readily available. Their wings are leathery, resembling those of a bat, though their forms often sprout black feathers. Their lower bodies end in scale-covered bird’s legs and jagged talons. It is their torsos that likely cause such speculation about Harpies, for they have the upper body of a voluptuous female with a savage and feral beauty. Their appearance has led to many arguments among scholars; some conclude that they are little more than mere beasts, others that they are touched by Chaos. Harpies will frequently try to attack with surprise and in large numbers. They put their wings to good advantage, using hit-and-run tactics on land-bound foes.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh2_dlc14_unit_long_text_def_veh_bloodwrack_shrine	When a great campaign beckons, the Hag Sorceress sends warriors into the caverns below the Spiteful Peaks to return with Bloodwrack Medusae in tow, their claws bound and their faces masked. At Morathi's direction, the captives are chained to Atharti's great Bloodwrack Shrines and propelled by Dark Magic to the very forefront of the assembled armies. A Bloodwrack Medusa's gaze is a fearsome weapon; should a victim's eyes lock with hers for even a second, his lifeblood violently rebels, flooding from every pore until his body collapses into a pool of its own gore. It is to guard against this that the shrinekeepers wear masks polished to a mirror-like sheen. Worse still, all who fight nearby find their minds twisted by an echo of the Medusa's endless despair. All save the Dark Elves, that is; to them, the scent of suffering is akin to the finest perfume – a heady brew when mixed with the tang of freshly-spilled blood.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh2_dlc14_unit_long_text_def_veh_scourgerunner_chariot	Beastmasters are always eager to find fresh subjects, for the many perils of battlefield, gladiatorial arena and neglect ensure that stables suffer a high rate of attrition. Small bands of Beastmasters roam the wilds in Scourgerunner Chariots, searching fen, crag and cave for suitable prizes. Armed with barbed nets and harpoons attached to strong chains, they snare and immobilise their prey. Once captured, the beast is trussed securely, yoked to the back of the chariot and dragged back to Clar Karond where a life of slavery and torment awaits – if the creature survives the journey at all. Scourgerunner Chariots are a common sight on the battlefield, where they search for suitable 'recruits' amongst the enemy ranks. If no fitting candidate presents itself, the Beastmasters vent their frustration as best they can, cutting down foes with lash, blade and harpoon before claiming the twitching bodies as fodder for their hungry charges.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh2_dlc14_unit_long_text_skv_cha_deathmaster_snikch	Deathmaster Snikch is the Chief Assassin and prime agent of Lord Sneek, Lord of Decay and Nightlord of Clan Eshin. His infamy is only exceeded by the mystery which surrounds his whereabouts at any particular time. Lord Sneek ensures that this is the case – as long as no one knows Snikch's location no one can truly feel safe. Deathmaster Snikch has appeared all over the Old World at one time or another, seldom being seen but always leaving his distinctive symbol traced in blood beside the decapitated heads of his victims. No one truly knows what horrors the Deathmaster has perpetrated during his long and mysterious existence. It is only on the battlefield that the Deathmaster's presence can at least be felt, stalking his victims, concealed beneath the magical Cloak of Shadows, its ensorcelled power strong enough to make a mockery of the most intricate defences. Where the stealthy tread of Deathmaster Snikch falls, no prince or warlord is safe from his blades.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh2_dlc14_unit_long_text_skv_cha_eshin_sorcerer	The Art of the Silent Death wasn’t the only thing Clan Eshin brought back when they returned from Cathay. A few Skaven delved into the black arts of magic. Blending what they already knew of the Warp with the techniques used by Cathay Sorcerers, they developed a new lore, one that serves to enhance their clan’s power and mystique. Eshin Sorcerers are mysterious, rare, and keep to themselves; they are well aware that the Grey Seers brook no competition from other Skaven spellcasters.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh2_dlc14_unit_long_text_skv_cha_master_assassin	Skaven assassins are so adept at hiding in the shadows that many suspect magic at work. The final tests in their training are death missions assigned by Clan Eshin's ruling council, presided over by Lord Sneek, clan leader and one of the Lords of Decay. If he survives the mission, the Assassin is considered an acknowledged master of the arts. It is thanks to their fearsome reputation that the Council of Thirteen often employ Eshin Assassins in their day-to-day affairs. When the Skaven hordes march to war, they are sometimes accompanied by Clan Eshin's finest hiding amongst their numbers, posing as regular rank-and-file troopers until the moment is right, before casting off their disguises and leaping into position. Fighting with poisoned blades in each paw, an Assassin can unleash a murderous flurry of attacks more than capable of striking down an enemy leader. At other times, an Assassin will operate alone, working to wreak havoc behind enemy lines, setting timed bombs or using poisoned shurikens to slay targets of opportunity.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh2_dlc14_unit_long_text_skv_inf_eshin_triads	The Assassins of Clan Eshin represent the culmination of years of training and ruthless murders. All Eshin warriors are trained to learn these defining skill-traits, but only the Assassins have the skill and experience necessary to undertake the highest tier of training. It is then that the secret arts are taught, some of which are ancient techniques studied in the Far East, but many more are unique fighting styles of the ratmen's own design. By the end of the long initiation, an Eshin Assassin can jump many times its own height, hurtle over obstacles or back-flip a great distance. He can run faster than a galloping horse and climb up smooth surfaces with ease. In motion, an Assassin is a blur, able to rain blows upon a foe or pluck arrows out of mid-flight. An Eshin Triad is a unit of three Skaven Assassins tasked with hunting down and killing vulnerable individuals and even small units.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh2_dlc14_unit_long_text_skv_inf_poison_wind_mortar	The Poisoned Wind Mortar is a form of light-artillery that allows a small team of Globadiers to lob a much larger payload of Poisoned Wind Globes at a much greater range than a lone Globadier could ever hope to achieve. This two-Skaven team requires one of its member to strap on the mortar upon his back while a second Skaven would load the ammunition inside the mortar itself. Additionally, with some hastily-squealed directions, a Poisoned Wind Mortar has the ability to fire on the go or indirectly at the enemy. Such a situation, where hurting the enemy without risking their own lives has always been an appealing idea to any Skaven.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh2_dlc14_unit_long_text_skv_inf_warp_grinder	A Warp-Grinder is a smaller and more portable version of a much larger drilling machine first devised by Clan Skryre as a means to tunnel far more quickly than a horde of slaves could ever hope to achieve. Some of these massive constructs are larger than the grandest ships of the Empire's navy. These huge devices combine great drills with Warp-Energy to vaporise broken debris as the machine bores. These rare machines are seldom, if ever, seen, but a portable version can be often found on the battlefield. The more portable Warp-Grinder opens up tunnels, pulverising stone and leaving a narrow and smoking passageway in its wake.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh2_dlc15_unit_long_text_grn_cha_grom_the_paunch	Grom the Paunch is a huge and powerful lump of a Goblin Warboss, a superlatively-sized individual whose looming presence and ferocity make him a living god amongst other Goblins. His prodigious size was caused by him once having consumed a portion of uncooked Troll meat, an act of gluttony that means he must relentlessly eat copious amounts of food to keep constantly digesting the regenerating flesh lest his massive, protruding belly eventually bursts. It is said that Grom has not seen his legs since consuming the foul meat, yet his frightening size means that he no longer needs to and can, instead, order others to see them for him if he wishes. Following countless successful raids across the Old World, his grandiose reputation has grown as much as his bloated frame. In the past, Grom’s Waaagh! had seen hundreds of different Greenskin tribes flock to his standard, held aloft by his Night Goblin standard-bearer, Niblet. In battle, the self-styled Goblin King often rides with his attendants upon a chariot suitably sized for his expansive proportions, charging into battle with devastating momentum only achievable due to his obscene weight.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh2_dlc15_unit_long_text_grn_cha_river_troll_hag	Giant River Troll Hags are repulsive and bitter creatures, far larger and more dangerous than their common Troll kin. Steeped in hateful, deathly magic absorbed over the ages into the stagnant mudholes where they lurk, they lay spiteful curses upon all who walk in nearby dry places beneath the hated sun. With a crudely-wrought net stuffed with all manner of dead things slung over its shoulder and a gnarled tree stump in the other hand, a River Troll Hag will readily use both devices to inflict mighty blows upon its prey before making it dinner. When the Winds blow especially strong, Hags have been known to answer the summons of Shamans who would bind them to their will, or Orcs who have lured them out of their lairs using live Goblins hung on the ends of long fishing lines as bait. Once their bellies are full, they happily accompany Greenskin hordes onto the field of battle where their fearsome nature, massive strength, and ability to cast myriad curses and hexes upon their foes make them terrible enemies indeed.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh2_dlc15_unit_long_text_grn_mon_river_trolls	As with all Troll varieties, the River Troll’s hunched appearances belies its powerful nature. Having physically adapted to their environment of bogs or untamed riverbanks, their skin often combines features seen in other trolls being warty, slimy, and scaly all at the same time. They are truly one of the foulest examples of the diversity amongst Trolls, partially submerging themselves in swamps or brackish ponds in order to sneak up on their prey and ambush them. The only chance their victims may have is that they absolutely reek of rotten fish, meaning their presence can sometimes be smelled before attacks take place. In times of war, they happily haul their smelly masses out of their waterholes to follow any Warbosses promising them a chance to gorge their bloated bellies on man-flesh – or any other sort of flesh for that matter.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh2_dlc15_unit_long_text_grn_mon_rogue_idol	Crushing armoured Knights, city walls, and just about anything else that gets in their way, Rogue Idols are the living embodiment of the spirit of the Waaagh!, gigantic stone effigies built in the shape of the Greenskin gods and driven by their arcane power. Arrows and broadswords break and shatter on their rocky bodies as they smash a brutal path of destruction through an army, near impervious to the blows being rained upon them due to lacking muscle and sinew to damage or blood to spill. Crudely fashioned from heaped stones and battlefield debris, Orc Shamans animate them with the help of obscene glyphs and slogans they daub upon them, though their control over the rocky behemoths is tenuous at best. On the battlefield, Rogue Idols loom over most things, striding implacably forwards with limbs the size of tree trunks and a malevolent grin carved into their leering faces. 	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh2_dlc15_unit_long_text_grn_mon_stone_trolls	Despite the lanky limbs that most varieties of Troll possess, they are all remarkably strong, with most of the species known for being able to regenerate flesh and regrow limbs almost as quickly as they are damaged. Stone Trolls differ slightly in this respect because they have extremely damage-resistant hides of rock-hard skin in the first place. This is due to the natural magical inertia of the large quantities of stone they consume in their diets, which also makes them naturally resistant to most types of magic. Living in underground caves or mountainous regions, they are most prevalent in and around the World’s Edge Mountains where they wander the slopes and passes until inevitably falling in with the various tribes of Orcs or Night Goblins commonly seen there.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh2_dlc15_unit_long_text_grn_mon_wyvern_waaagh	The scaled hides and general appearance of Feral Wyverns often result in them being mistaken for small Dragons. Though the voracious predators do share several similarities with their larger cousins, they are much less intelligent and notably have a distinct lack of forelimbs – the sort of detail that is easily overlooked when one is running for their life as fast as possible in the other direction. Usually inhabiting dark caves high in the most barren mountains, the flying monsters do not only emerge from their lairs just to feed, but also to seek out ill-tempered mischief. It is this tendency which often draws them into the belligerent frenzy of a Greenskin Waaagh! in which they either get wrangled into mounts by Orcs brave (or stupid) enough to attempt to break them, or are just used to wreak havoc amongst the enemy battle lines they are haphazardly directed towards.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh2_dlc15_unit_long_text_grn_veh_snotling_pump_wagon	The devilish contraption known as the Snotling Pump Wagon is no ordinary chariot, but more of a primitive fighting platform on wheels. They are built and crewed by the pea-brained Snotlings, smallest of the Greenskin races and cousins to the much larger Orcs. It is a great wonder of the world that they can build such war machines, since the runts barely know how to use tools and often struggle to even pick their own noses. It seems that Snotlings are particularly affected by the strange energies that drive Waaagh! events, scuttering together at such times to hastily assemble their Pump Wagons, and later providing the momentum to drive them forward with primitive cranks and belts. The various killing-contraptions often fitted to the front of the crudely constructed wagons help inflict fatal injuries as they roll over any foes (or crew) that fall before them.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh2_dlc15_unit_long_text_hef_cha_eltharion_the_grim	Eltharion the Grim is truly one of the greatest of all Ulthuan’s generals. His past exploits of driving attackers from the shores of Ulthuan, including the first legendary Waaagh! of Grom himself, saw him elected as the Warden of Tor Yvresse, and in previous years he has taken his blade overseas to the Old World in an attempt to scour his arch enemies – the Greenskins – from the land. Though he managed to slaughter countless Warbosses and topple many Orc fortresses that theretofore had survived earthquakes, Bretonnian crusades, and Dwarf sieges, he eventually learned that the attentions of the belligerent Greenskins could never be abated. Returning to Tor Yvresse, Eltharion decided with grim determination that he would use his tenure to train the city’s armies and fortify its defences as never before. When the city comes under threat, the Warden of Tor Yvresse uses any and all means to protect his realm. Though his methods may be questionable to his peers, the dour ruler is dearly loved by his people and feared by his enemies, taking to the skies upon his Griffon Stormwing in times of war to cut through foes like a wind of blades.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh2_dlc15_unit_long_text_hef_cha_imrik	Despite having a measure of pride that some might consider arrogance, Imrik is the most noble of the Dragon Princes, whose surety of deeds and martial judgement are said to border on the supernatural. Now a silent realm, Caledor’s scattered Princes are considered by many of the Asur to be dangerously haughty, never making a secret of the fact they think themselves superior to Ulthuan’s other soldiers to the point of having nothing remarkable in common with them at all. Imrik is no exception to the audacity of his kin, though in his case it is justified. Hailing from the bloodline of the Phoenix King Caledor himself, Imrik is the last Dragon Prince to fight in the traditional manner of his house, atop a mighty Fire Drake known as Minaithnir. Though Imrik may be accused of having an unhealthy disdain for weakness, he has always fought nobly in defence of his homeland and indeed of all Ulthuan, continually proving himself a stalwart bastion of strength and an unbreachable wall against the foes of the High Elves.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh2_dlc15_unit_long_text_hef_inf_mistwalkers_faithbearers	Moranion, Eltharion's father, perished in Grom's destruction of Athel Tamarha, but not all of his household were slain. A few Elves, their courage overcome by the sheer size of the Waaagh!, escaped into the woods, leaving their home to its fate. Though these Elves soon reclaimed their valour, and harried the Goblin army as it advanced on Tor Yvresse, they ever blamed themselves for Moranion's death. Since those days, they have fought at Eltharion's side as the Athel Tamarha Faithbearers, hoping to erase their guilt for the father by offering service to the son.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh2_dlc15_unit_long_text_hef_inf_mistwalkers_griffon_knights	Princes of Yvresse dislike fighting from the skies, for their homeland is swathed in a mist that makes flying a very dangerous proposition indeed. However, there were always those to flout convention. The Knights of Tor Gaval were one such group, having trained their entire lives to fight atop winged steeds amongst Yvresse's thick mists. Some rode Griffons, others Eagles – a few had even purchased Skycutters from the navy of Lothern. Thanks to the challenges of training in their murky homeland, the Knights of Tor Gaval were rightly said to be amongst the most talented of wingmen in all Ulthuan.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh2_dlc15_unit_long_text_hef_inf_mistwalkers_sentinels	When Eltharion set sail from Ulthuan, he was loath to take any Mistwalkers of Yvresse, for their Daemon-hunting expertise would be greatly needed if Ulthuan was to endure the onslaught of the Chaos Gods. However, Tyrion argued that one band of Mistwalkers, more or less, would make little difference to Ulthuan's fate, but might spell the difference between victory and defeat for Eltharion's expedition. Knowing wisdom when he heard it, Eltharion accepted the service of the Sentinels of Astaril, the very company with which he had honed his own skills as a youth.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh2_dlc15_unit_long_text_hef_inf_mistwalkers_skyhawks	The Skyhawks are Mistwalkers of Yvresse, tied by tradition to the heirs of Argalen, son of Moranion. When Anaran and Anarelle resolved to defend the Blighted Isle, the Skyhawks were battling creatures of the Annulii on the border between Yvresse and Eataine. Abandoning the fight to the Eataine militias, they marched northwards at incredible speed, reaching the Blighted Isle some hours before Malekith's vanguard. Though weary from their journey, the Skyhawks stood ready to fight beside Argalen's heirs – to the death, if necessary.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh2_dlc15_unit_long_text_hef_inf_mistwalkers_spireguard	Originally formed as an honour guard by the Warden of Tor Yvresse to protect his tower, the tallest spire in the kingdom's majestic capital, the Spire Guard have since become the city's foremost defenders – the anchor around which the army of Tor Yvresse now forms. Time and time again, the Spire Guard have turned the tide of battle by stubbornly holding the line, pouring arrows into their foes to buy time for their kin to regroup and counter-attack.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh2_dlc15_unit_long_text_hef_inf_rangers	High Elf warriors who hail from the more remote parts of Ulthuan do not train together in the regimented manner of the spearmen and archers of the cities. Instead, they hone their personal fighting skills in smaller training bands, coming together in times of need to fight alongside their metropolitan counterparts. Thus the skillset and garb of the High Elf Ranger differs from most, often donning lighter armour to enable swifter movement across terrain and to facilitate the greater freedom of movement required to wield two swords at once. Often coming from more insular communities, High Elf Rangers can be bitter, haughty, and proud, but have a well-deserved reputation as some of the most steadfast warriors of the Asur.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh2_dlc15_unit_long_text_hef_mon_arcane_phoenix	The Arcane Phoenix is a majestic and fearsome creature, with a wingspan typically as great as any of the mighty war-eagles of the High Elves. They are cloaked in blazing feathers that can turn the sharpest arrow, their true power bound to their nature as a creature of spirit and fire; the living embodiments of the destructive and purging Wind of Aqshy. Flames dance across their pinions to sear their prey whenever they attack, a long pair of feathered tails leaving a spray of blazing sparks and embers in their wake as they swoop across the battlefield. Wizards go to great lengths to bind Arcane Phoenixes to their will whenever they appear, both to command their considerable power as well as to keep their destructive wrath out of the hands of their enemies.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh2_dlc15_unit_long_text_hef_mon_war_lions_of_chrace	Of all the beasts that prowl the mysterious forests of the Elven realm of Chrace, the white War Lions are perhaps the best renowned. They are deadly, muscular-framed hunting cats, almost as tall at the shoulders as an Elven steed but far stronger, able to break bones with each sweep of their claws and shatter even helmeted heads with a single chomp of their fanged maws. When preparing for war, it has been known for High Elf Mages to bind War Lions to their will, though such a gesture is not without risk. When armoured for battle, War Lions maintain their lethal predatory instinct, constantly ready to pounce should danger present itself in the form of an enemy. It is clearly with the greatest measure of pride that the White Lions of Chrace, personal guard of the Phoenix King since the time of Caledor the First, took their name.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh2_dlc15_unit_long_text_hef_veh_lion_chariot_of_chrace	The ranks of the White Lions, the personal guard of the Phoenix King, are made up of warriors who have not only displayed considerable valour and skill upon the battlefield, but have also completed the traditional rite of a Chracian warrior to hunt and kill a white lion. Sometimes such hunts lead to the discovery of cubs which, with expert care, can be raised to form a close bond with the Chracian hunters that foster them and later serve in Ulthuan’s armies. Those able to form such bonds inevitably end up riding to battle upon white-timbered chariots drawn by a pair of the snarling beasts, whose savage killing power is belied by their appearance of feline grace and elegantly plaited manes. The Lion Chariots of Chrace have a well-deserved reputation as the bane of even the most determined shield wall.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh2_dlc16_unit_long_text_skv_cha_chieftain	A Warlord cannot be everywhere at once and so must build up a cadre of enforces – loyal (for the moment) Chieftains that can ensure that a Warlord’s word is law and that he has a paw in all profitable ventures. These commanders are more powerfully built than the warriors they ruthlessly command, using their advantage to claw their way to promotion. In reality, mere physical prowess is not enough to sustain control without manipulation; the ability to set rivals upon each and muster support are skills needed to keep hold of power, as even the fiercest fighters become worn down by the constant challenges of Skaven life.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh2_dlc16_unit_long_text_skv_cha_ghoritch	Like many devoted to the Blood God, Ghoritch was once a frenzied Marauder Berserker who loved the thrill of battle and the tang of fresh blood upon his tongue. He served Archaon throughout the Storm of Chaos, but the creed of his true master ran strong in his veins, causing Ghoritch to lead a foolhardy attack on an Empire artillery train despite express orders to the contrary. Though he slew a score of men that day and lived to tell the tale, Ghoritch's tribe were cut down almost to a man. For his insubordination and failure, Archaon sent him to the Master Mutators of Clan Moulder for their unholy experiments. Even shackled and bound, Throt the Unclean could see Ghoritch was of exceptional stock, singling him out for the climax of a series of experiments and successfully transplanting the Berserker’s mind into the body of a heavily modified Rat Ogre without driving him mad in the process. The resulting combination of intellect and strength was perfect for quelling rebellious troops, and it was not long before Ghoritch had worked his way up to the rank of Chieftain. Naturally, Throt is less than pleased at the meteoric rise of his creation, and he hopes to one day create something better to bring about his dangerously-ambitious Chieftain's downfall.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh2_dlc16_unit_long_text_skv_cha_packmaster	The mutated fighting beasts made by Clan Moulder are whipped forward into battle by Packmasters, specially-trained experts who goad the charges of their ferocious, half-mad creatures that are always at risk of turning against their handlers without warning. For this reason, Packmasters themselves are cagey and fierce warriors, or if they are not, they quickly end up as another meal for their merciless packs. The whip is a favoured weapon and beast driving tool of the Packmasters, who quickly learn to become adept at using them to direct feral packs, or, when engaged in combat, to snap the weapon at the enemy, attacking over the heads of Giant Rats or between hulking Rat Ogres. It is common practice for Clan Moulder to sell both beast packs and Packmaster handlers, allowing them to leave Hell Pit to serve under Warlord clans across the globe.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh2_dlc16_unit_long_text_skv_cha_throt_the_unclean	Throt’s status as one of Hell Pit’s most feared Lords is evident from his ability to create and lead to battle vast numbers of bloodthirsty creatures. Exercising more control over his minions than even the most adept Packmaster, it is no surprise that he is a forerunner in advancing Clan Moulder’s status, joining many Skaven battles accompanied by his packs of warbeasts. Whenever Throt personally joins a fight he wields Creature-Killer, a modified things-catcher of his own design that can grab and throttle even beasts the size of a Rat Ogre. Additionally, Throt carries a special whip made from Minotaur hide and cured in Troll digestive juices. Even the hunchbacked and mutated things that scuttle through the warrens of Hell Pit with senses dulled fear its stinging pain.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh2_dlc16_unit_long_text_skv_mon_brood_horror	When Clan Moulder spawns a pack of Giant Pox Rats, there is occasionally one among them who will brutally devour the rest of the brood, growing fat and bloated in both strength and savagery, the twisted forms of its kin still visible as they writhe and claw at their fleshy prison. The so-called Brood Horrors are highly prized by the Master Mutators, who trade them with the wealthier Skaven clans for use as as war-mounts for especially powerful or ostentatious Skaven warlords, or goad them into battle to flail and crush the foe beneath their razor-clawed limbs.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh2_dlc16_unit_long_text_skv_mon_wolf_rats	The ravenous, monstrous Wolf Rats are neither rat nor wolf, but an aberrant amalgamation of the two that is both lean and insatiably hungry. When used in battle, their slavering packs are unleashed ahead of other troops since the beasts will readily charge headlong into an enemy, so eager they are to feast upon flesh. Fearless enough to dash into a hail of arrows, they will pounce and rip out an archer’s throat before he has had time to draw his bow for a second shot. Then, tensing back on their long muscular limbs, they will leap hungrily into the ranks behind to take their fill of the bounteous feast laid before them.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh2_dlc16_unit_long_text_wef_cav_great_stag_knights	Great Stags are magical beasts that are closely connected to the most ancient forests. It is said that when one emerges from its dark arboreal shelter, it signals the onset of portentous times and that great deeds are at hand. Creatures of such noble presence can only be tamed for brief periods and never truly mastered. Despite this, they sometimes serve as war-steeds for particularly bold and noble Elves and especially those of righteous cause. To ride a Great Stag is to charge into battle with unsurpassed grace, for they are kings amongst beasts, natural spirits of the world made manifest.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh2_dlc16_unit_long_text_wef_cha_ariel	Before the Elves embraced Athel Loren as their home, Ariel was foremost among the Elven magi living on the forest’s fringes. It was she who first spoke through the art of tree-singing, paving the way for the complex alliance with the powerful forest-spirits. In the wake of the devastating Winter of Woe, when the forest had barely survived attacks from both Dwarfs and Greenskins, Ariel acquired the aspects of Isha, the Goddess of Nature, through the strange magic of the Oak of Ages. Together with Orion, she presides over Athel Loren, weaving enchantments to mislead intruders or lure them to their doom, and like Orion, Ariel’s immortality is linked to the seasons – she hibernates each midwinter to emerge the following year.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh2_dlc16_unit_long_text_wef_cha_coeddil	Coeddil the Cunning was one of the three Elders of the Treeman Ancients who survived the first coming of Chaos. For long centuries it was he who directed the forest’s wrath against its despoilers without the need of the Asrai’s assistance. Coeddil had never agreed with the decision to allow the Elves to make their home within Athel Loren, eventually betraying them in a bloodstained attack. For his treachery, the powerful Mage Queen Ariel imprisoned him deep in the Wildwood and encircled with magical Waystones. Now, with his newfound freedom, the future of the Asrai and their alliance with the great forest is shrouded in uncertainty...	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh2_dlc16_unit_long_text_wef_cha_drycha	Drycha, the Briarmaven of Woe, is a powerful spirit of Athel Loren. Long ago, she held court amongst the roots of Addaivoch, the once-glorious creature known in recent times as the Tree of Woe. Most believe that Drycha lost her mind when Morghur’s death tainted that ground forever, but in truth she was capricious and malevolent for many long years before that tragedy. She remembers well the days before the coming of the Elves, and has ever rued the folly that tied the forest to their fateful whims. She rarely converses with others, even the Dryads who serve her as handmaidens, but instead chants a mantra of the names of all those fellow spirits whom she believes have been failed by the Elves. As old as Drycha is, she still possesses a crystal-clear memory, though it is doubtful that she will ever reach the end of her tally; new names are added with every battle between Athel Loren and the outside world.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh2_dlc16_unit_long_text_wef_cha_sisters_of_twilight	Arahan and Naestra are Ariel’s heralds of mysterious origin, who first appeared during the long years of the Mage Queen's self-imposed exile from the mortal realm. Amongst the fey folk of Athel Loren the Sisters of Twilight are notable for an other-worldliness of spirit and manner, and such qualities are evident when they take to the battlefield. Any weapons the sisters touch become infused with a portion of their nature. Those wielded by Naestra become anathema to creatures of anarchy and discord, whilst Arahan’s tools of battle inflict great harm on beings with noble souls. They seldom fight from the centre of the battle line, but are instead carried through war-torn skies by one of their loyal steeds – Gwindalor, descendent of the King of Eagles, and Ceithin-Har, as hot-blooded a Dragon that has ever been flown into battle. 	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh2_dlc16_unit_long_text_wef_inf_bladesingers	Sometimes known as Shadow Dancers of Loec, Feast Masters, Bladesingers, or Deathdancers, Wardancers roam Athel Loren in tightly-knit troupes, treading paths and secret ways that few others know or dare use. Other Wood Elves regard them as wild and unpredictable, and not without cause, for they are the servants and worshippers of the Elven Trickster God, Loec. The Wardancers lead the Elves in music and rejoicing, and perform the intricate dance rituals that re-enact the history of Athel Loren, a form of storytelling more important to the Wood Elves than the more conventional method of writing. Wardancers are sublime warriors, made even more deadly through their war dances. For these, the favoured rituals of the Trickster God, no rhythm is called nor are orders issued. Instead, the dancers instinctively enact a pattern of lethal movements, complementing the dances performed by the rest of the troupe. Each Wardancer leaps and pirouettes through the enemy ranks to music only she hears, gracefully evading her opponent's clumsy blows and ending his life with an impossibly swift strike of her own.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh2_dlc16_unit_long_text_wef_mon_cave_bats	The bat species that inhabit the darkest reaches of the forests are known to be some of nature’s most noisome and nasty assailants. When compelled to do harm, they appear from the shadows in a hail of claws and teeth to cause fatal injury to any caught in their deadly swarm. Out in the wild they are as any other flying carnivore with a taste for fresh blood, often thriving near the top of a territory’s food chain, at least for a time. Those familiar with forests of the Old World know to stay away from unfamiliar caves in the middle of woodlands rich in smaller fauna, for it is likely they are being inhabited as roosts by the foul, flying monsters.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh2_dlc16_unit_long_text_wef_mon_giant_spiders	There are many sub-types of Giant Spider, such as Tilean Greybacks, Drakwald Mancatchers, and the Scarlet Deathheads of the Great Forest, to name just a few. All are poisonous and have steely, pincer-like mandibles that can punch through platemail to deliver a toxic bite and administer a venom that can paralyse prey if not kill outright. While often not as fast as wolves or horses out in the open, these spiders can move at speed through the most dense patches of woods. In the forest they can grow to an enormous size, large enough to completely suck the life juices from their victims to leave behind only skin-husks and bones.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh2_dlc16_unit_long_text_wef_mon_hawks	Just like their close relatives the Great Eagles, Great Hawks have lived among the peaks since long before the rise of the lesser races. From the vantage points of their high eyries, they keep close watch on the world and their forest habitats below, carefully observing the deeds of ground-dwelling creatures. It takes considerable centuries to earn the trust of these noble creatures, and so thus far only those with a close relationship with the forest such as Elves and Tree Spirits have managed to do so. If shown that an alliance lies in their interest, Great Hawks need not always be bound by sorcery, but any bargain struck with them must be adhered to unless the bargainer wishes to find themselves on the wrong end of their deadly talons.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh2_dlc16_unit_long_text_wef_mon_wolves	The Forest Wolves of the Old World have oft been the subject of mythology and folklore, foreboding beasts of the wild that those who get lost in the woods pray they never encounter. The common wolf was once widely distributed across the world, but hunting and culling left only the toughest and most vicious of the species still roaming in the wilds. Once set upon by a pack of wolves, it is unlikely one will outrun them – their long legs, large feet, and deep but narrow chests make up an animal built for stamina and travel. Combined with its keen senses, large canine teeth and powerful jaws, it truly is one of the most feared natural predators of the forest. 	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh2_dlc16_unit_long_text_wef_mon_zoats	Massive, mace-wielding, and aggressively territorial when encountered up close, Zoats are in fact highly magical creatures that prefer to avoid detection in the wild. Instead they will rouse the trees and undergrowth to crush and strangle interlopers before taking any direct action. Their magical abilities are used in an instinctive manner not gained through study or ritual, enabling them to imbue a forest with a reputation so dreadful that even marauding Orcs and rampaging warherds will give the area a wide berth. When eldritch storms erupt upon the world, it is possible to draw the creatures out of their reclusive forest homes to bind them into service. On the battlefield a Zoat can knock swathes of enemies down with a single sweeping swing of its weapon while simultaneously using its innate connection to the Winds of Magic.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh2_dlc17_unit_long_text_bst_cav_tuskgor_chariot	The muscular, shaggy frames of the Tuskgor are usually seen on the battlefield in pairs, pulling the large, wooden chariots of the Beastmen behind them. Their brutish strength and crooked horns make them formidable opponents in their own right, running riot through enemy lines, while the axes and whips of their riders cut through any left standing. Charging across the field of battle, the Tuskgor Chariots of the Beastmen are carnage incarnate, inflicting catastrophic damage and leaving only corpses in their wake.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh2_dlc17_unit_long_text_bst_cha_doombull	As the savage Minotaur Lords of the Beastmen, the Doombull charge their enemies head on. Their vicious horns skewer all in their path, and anything left standing will feel the devastating brunt of their dual-bound chains. Though lacking in intelligence, these Bloodcallers make up for it with sheer animal strength, and a brutality of nature that drives them to gore and trample their foes with unbridled, bloodthirsty abandon. 	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh2_dlc17_unit_long_text_bst_cha_taurox_the_brass_bull	Once a domineering Minotaur chieftain, Taurox ravaged the land with blood and carnage in every direction, before he devoured the head from an emissary of the fell powers and the madness that took hold of him expanded the slaughter tenfold. Reborn with a shining body of brass and a heart gripped by endless rage, the Bloodbeast will never tire, and his rampage of indiscriminate butchery is bloody and unending.  	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh2_dlc17_unit_long_text_bst_cha_wargor	As leaders among the Beastmen, the Wargor demonstrate an intelligence sorely lacking in the Doombull, yet their might and brutality is no less prevalent. Driven by an insatiable lust for battle, they wade into the thick of the fight with mace in hand, and relish in crushing the skulls of their foes. Cruel and ruthless, the Wargor lead with a total disregard for all but the kill. When they ride to war astride the menacing Tuskgor, the enemies of the Beastmen can only tremble with fear.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh2_dlc17_unit_long_text_bst_mon_ghorgon	The Ghorgon devour all. Their endless hunger has twisted them with mutation, transforming them into savage, many-armed monstrosities, feasting on the flesh of enemy and ally alike. When capably channelled towards a common foe, the Ghorgon rampage through their ranks, brutally slaughtering their victims and consuming them whole. Their hunger however, is never sated. Should the well-spring of enemy flesh run dry, their ravenous focus is likely to shift, and those they once warred beside may soon become their next meal. 	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh2_dlc17_unit_long_text_bst_mon_jabberslythe	The horrifically hideous countenance of the Jabberslythe is sure to make even the most inspiring of leaders falter. An aura of madness surrounds the winged, toad-like creature, tugging at the sanity of all who witness it and warping their feeble minds. From the Jabberslythe's gaping jaws launches a grotesque, clawed tongue, spitting acidic bile from its throat. Foes quake in their presence, as likely to receive a spray of poisonous blood as they are to be caught in their claws, and dragged into their cavernous mouths whole.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh2_dlc17_unit_long_text_dwf_cha_thorek_ironbrow	Wheeling forwards atop the storied Anvil of Doom, the legendary Runelord Thorek Ironbrow works amidst the roar of battle, hammering powerful magic into the ancient runes of the Dwarfs. Harsh and unyielding, he will accept nothing less than victory. Bearing the runed weapons he has forged — with potent magic woven expertly into their blades — the soldiers who war beside him trust the masterful swing of his hammer will lead them to glory.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh2_dlc17_unit_long_text_lzd_cha_oxyotl	To survive in the Chaos Realm requires cunning and skill, both of which Oxyotl possesses in abundance. An ancient Chameleon Skink of unparalleled experience, he has seen the turn of thousands of years, and the witnessed the very origins of Chaos in the world. Now, he hunts the dark forces of corruption. A figure in the dark, he strikes with a dart from his blowpipe, then slips back into the shadows once more. Wherever the forces of Chaos rise, Oxyotl is always sure to follow.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh2_dlc17_unit_long_text_lzd_cha_skink_oracle_troglodon	Riding into battle on the backs of the fearsome Troglodon, the Skink Oracles keep foes at a distance with the venomous spit of their mounts. Blessed with a small fraction of the Slann's foresight, they sense danger mere moments before it descends, riding instantly to combat it. Unleashing the full force of their magic, they cast their protection over allies, and rain devastating strikes of mystical energy down upon their foes.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh2_dlc17_unit_long_text_lzd_inf_chameleon_stalkers	From seemingly nowhere will spring the sudden barrage of the Chameleon Stalkers, who stand invisible on the battlefield but for the moment they fire. Their stealthy approach is neither seen nor heard by the enemy as they follow their prey, waiting for the opportunity to strike. Swift and agile, they move as one, stalking the battlefield. With their precise aim and deadly subterfuge, the Chameleon Stalkers' service is invaluable to the Great Plan.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh2_dlc17_unit_long_text_lzd_mon_coatl	The long, feathered wings of the Coatl spread high above the field of battle, casting shadow over the forces of Chaos and raining magical fury down on their ranks. With the head of a Dragon and a scaled, serpentine body, the Coatl forms an intimidating silhouette before the sun. Blocking the rays of light above its own forces, the Lizardmen army in its shadow is obscured, shielded from the eyes of their enemies.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh2_dlc17_unit_long_text_lzd_mon_troglodon	Without Skink Oracles to command them, the Feral Troglodon are even more vicious in their own right. Unburdened by a rider, they streak at the enemy with speed and power, firing their venomous spit at every foe before them, their poison sinking deep into the skin. As mounts, they are quick and able protectors, yet as a unit of their own, the Troglodon are as wild and unpredictable as they are fierce.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh2_main_unit_long_text_def_art_reaper_bolt_thrower	Reaper Bolt Throwers are used at sea to clear the decks of enemy vessels, and on land to scythe down ranks of enemy warriors. A mechanism of counterweights and cords allow the Reaper to shoot a hail of bolts, or a single missile with force enough to pierce a Dragon's hide. The bolts are barbed and difficult to remove from the wounds they inflict. Those injured - but not slain - by such a shot often suffer such horrendous maiming on the bolt's removal that they are worthless as slaves, and are therefore left to bleed to death or given over to the bloody caresses of the Witch Elves.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh2_main_unit_long_text_def_cav_cold_one_chariot	Cold One Chariots are sometimes given as gifts to those rare individuals who have pleased Lord Malekith with their devotion and prowess in battle. To possess such a machine is a symbol of great prestige, and is ranked amongst the highest stations in battle, even though the Cold Ones' truculent nature can often bring the chariot to a jarring halt at the most inopportune moments. Should the crew retain mastery of their chariot, they thunder across the battlefield like gods of war, wicked spears levelled and Cold Ones roaring fit to freeze the blood. In the last moment before impact, the crew goad their steeds to one last effort and the chariot crashes into the enemy ranks, crushing foes with the weight of its impact and opening flesh to the bone with the blades upon its flanks.	false

They are nobles of great wealth and ambition, whose warrior instincts elevate them far beyond the upstart cavalrymen of lesser races. Their weapons are the finest that can be bought in the great cities: long swords enchanted in such a manner as to never lose their edge, and tall lances sharp enough to pierce the hide of a Dragon. Their mounts, too, are superior to those of other lands; no horse, no matter how well-trained or carefully bred, could ever hope to match the savagery of a Naggarothi Cold One.	false

These Dark Riders wore cloaks of black feathers, invoking the raven-headed god Nethu to keep them hidden from the eyes of the enemy. During the civil war, the Dark Riders earned a more sinister reputation. They travelled ahead of Nagarythe's hosts, sowing terror and confusion wherever they rode, burning villages and driving their people into the wilds.

unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh2_main_unit_long_text_def_cha_khainite_assassin_0	Assassins are masters of a subtle and murderous magic, trained from infancy to be the chosen warriors of Khaine. They move silently and with a precision that surpasses even the standards of other Elves. Blindfolded, an Assassin can walk sure-footedly across the spears of an embattled phalanx, or strike a precise flurry of blows so that each cut exploits a different weakness of armour or flesh. Assassins are also masters of using poison, and they coat their weapons in a variety of toxins - some are deadly, others paralyse or stupefy their victim. One scratch from some of these poisons is enough to send a man into agonising paroxysms as his nerves burn, his heart explodes or his bones crack and shatter. Assassins take great pleasure in the awful demises of their victims and often keep prisoners alive for many days. Often, they extract confessions and information from captives much more quickly than the crude tortures used by other Naggarothi interrogators.	false

unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh2_main_unit_long_text_def_cha_sorceress	Elves have a natural affinity for the shifting Winds of Magic. In the ancient days, they learnt the secrets of manipulating this mystical power from the Slann, the most powerful servants of the Old Ones. Yet for all their expertise, there was always a limit to the amount of power the Elves could harness - the risk of madness and spiritual corruption prevented them from delving deeper into the power of Chaos. It was Morathi who first ventured into this forbidden territory. Through dark rituals and bloody sacrifices, she moulded the energies of Chaos to her bidding. With this sorcery - the unrefined power of magic - Morathi soon began to weave enchantments and spells whose raw power far outstripped anything the Elves had previously known. To this day, Dark Elves study the sorcerous arts, utterly seduced by the unrestrained energy it allows them to command.	false

It is a hard, dangerous life in the raiding fleets, but a successful voyage can see a captain and crew return laden down with wealth beyond the dreams of most city-dwellers. It is not uncommon for a Corsair fleet to spend years ransacking foreign lands, returning home only when their holds are bursting with slaves and plunder. As they tend to do most of their fighting in the topmasts of ships and the crowded tangle of dockside streets, Black Ark Corsairs prefer fast weapons that give them an edge in one-on-one fights. Cutlasses, punch daggers and barbed knives are common, as are repeater handbows. Corsairs eschew shields and metal armour, relying on cloaks fashioned from Sea Dragon hide to preserve them from injury. They also carry a vile array of nets, grapples and barbed chains. Such tools are not only useful for getting a grip on the slippery flank of a ship, but also for ensnaring fleeing victims, who are soon thereafter dragged to a terrible fate.	false

unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh2_main_unit_long_text_def_inf_black_guard_0	The Black Guard are Malekith's personal army, answerable to no other save he. They are recruited from the offspring of families high in the Witch King's favour, taken at birth from mothers who are soon thereafter put to the sword. With no family ties to distract them, these children are raised within the barracks of the Black Guard and taught the myriad skills of death and destruction that are required of Malekith's foremost elite. The barracks of the Black Guard are divided into twenty towers which compete against each other in contests of war and torture. The Witch King grimly encourages competition between the towers and each year, at the beginning of the Season of Blood, a tournament is held to determine which tower will hold dominance over the others for the coming year. The leaders of these factions are the Tower Masters, veterans of the Black Guard so inculcated with death and battle that they choose to continue in Malekith's service after their two centuries of duty have been completed. These hardened warriors rule their underlings with a will of iron, determined that their tower shall not be shamed by lack of discipline - or worse, a glimmer of mercy - on the part of their charges.	false

Most such warriors are conscripted into service, but a few muster willingly, having identified some manner in which the battle will play to their personal advantage. All Dark Elves are arrogant beyond tolerance, but Bleakswords far outstrip even other Naggarothi in this regard. Each believes himself to be the greatest warrior of his age, needless of aid and heedless of danger. Bleakswords forsake the spear and the repeater crossbow, deeming the former a peasant's weapon and the latter a craven armament. Instead, they wield slender duelling blades that flash past an enemy's guard to slit his throat or pierce his heart.	false

Through blood spilt and shed, they have learnt the strength of discipline, of the locked shieldwall bristling with wicked spearpoints. Dreadspear regiments are therefore the reliable bastions around which a Dreadlord can form his battleplan.

Countless victims are brought here to be sacrificed upon Khaine's altars. It was in Har Ganeth that the first ceremonies of execution were held. In the wake of a great victory over the High Elves, the guards of Har Ganeth led thousands of captives to the pinnacle of the temple and beheaded them with full ceremony and ritual. Such was the Dark Elves' delight when they beheld the bloodied heads tumbling down the steps that, from that day forth, executions became a regular feature in Har Ganeth society and a punishment for all manner of diverse crimes. Every Executioner carries a draich, the ceremonial weapon of his calling, forged by its wielder under the supervision of the armourers of Khaine's great temple. As an Executioner learns his bloody skills, he also refines his weapon so that the two are as one. Some Executioners prefer a heavy axe-like blade, others a slender sword, depending upon their own abilities and preferred method of killing. Regardless of design, these weapons are fearsome in battle, able to cleave through armour, flesh and bone with but a single, flawlessly placed strike.	false

In Naggarothi lore, Harpies are considered to be an omen of good fortune, and it is claimed that if they ever deserted Karond Kar, the city would fall soon after. Harpies are similar in temperament to the Dark Elves, for they delight in tormenting their victims.

Their observances to the Lord of Murder are blood-slicked affairs. Still-beating hearts are ripped from victim's chests and hurled into fires, writhing flesh is daubed with gore-red runes and altars are decorated with the entrails of dying captives. Yet ceremonies are but a part of the Witch Elves' worship - their truest observances take place upon the field of battle. On the eve of war, Witch Elves drink blood laced with poisonous barbs, driving them into a divine frenzy. Whilst in this god-touched state, they give no thought to their own defence, and seek only to hack foes apart in a blood-drenched orgy of slaughter. There is little grace to such an assault, merely a whirling storm of venom-coated blades that slash at the foe with maddened fury. Those enemies unfortunate enough to survive their wounds are rounded up by the Witch Elves at the battle's end. These poor souls are torn apart in wild victory celebrations, their blood offered in libation to the ever-thirsting Lord of Murder.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh2_main_unit_long_text_def_mon_black_dragon	Dragons once ruled the skies of the world. Now, their race is but a shadow of its former power and majesty. When the Old Ones arrived, the greatest Dragons found the world too warm for their liking and hid from the bright sun, while more still stole into caverns and the ocean deeps with the coming of Chaos. A Black Dragon is capable of slaughtering entire armies with its claws, horns and fangs. With expulsions of noxious gas from its maw, it can wither the lungs of its victims and desiccate their flesh. The thick hide of a Black Dragon protects it from even the weightiest blows. Perhaps the greatest weapon of all is the overwhelming Wyrm-dread that fills the enemy upon sighting such a bloodthirsty and destructive monster.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh2_main_unit_long_text_def_mon_war_hydra_0	The Hydra is a titanic beast of the mountains, whose ill-tempered and ravenous nature has proven the doom of many an unsuspecting morsel. Indeed, so ferocious is the Hydra that campaigning armies often make wide detours to avoid intruding on such a beast's bone-strewn lair. Those that march on regardless do so either out of confidence in their battle-prowess or ignorance of the Hydra's savagery. War Hydras are notoriously difficult for their handlers to control, and a Beastmaster must be quick with his lash lest he be devoured in the enemy's stead. They are even more difficult to slay, for not only are their scaly bodies incredibly well armoured, they also regenerate damage at a frightening rate. A foe's only chance is to sever all the monsters heads in quick succession - if even a single one remains, the remainder will swiftly gross back and devour the impudent attacker for his troubles.	false

Eagle Claws can be found not only in Lothern, but throughout High Elf lands. The weapon's canny design allows its crew to alternate fire modes at will - it can loose single shots capable of disembowelling a rampaging Giant, or clutches of six lesser bolts to mow down massed infantry before they reach the High Elf lines. Such is the skill of The Eagle Claw's Sea Guard crew, and the speed with which they reload, that only seconds separate one deadly volley from the next.	false

Both mount and rider wear crested ithilmar armour whose style echoes that of the Dragons riders of old. This Dragon armour is forged in the heart of Vaul's Anvil, where ancient enchantments are bound into the cooling ithilmar, ensuring that no lesser flame than the fires of Vaul can offer harm to the armour or its wearer.	false

Only when the enemy is sufficiently weakened do the Tiranoc Charioteers crash into the press of melee in a glorious massed charge, the steeds biting and kicking, the riders thrusting their spears into the black hearts of their foes.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh2_main_unit_long_text_hef_cha_alastair_0	The White Lions have served as the personal guard of the Phoenix King since the time of Caledor the First. White Lion regiments are often despatched to join the armies of Ulthuan during times of particular danger, tasked with protecting High Elf generals and mages, or bolstering the overall strength of the army. White Lions are renowned for their unflinching courage in the face of overwhelming odds and terrible horrors, protecting their charge whatever the foe and regardless of the danger to themselves.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh2_main_unit_long_text_hef_cha_loremaster_of_hoeth_0	The Loremasters of Hoeth are invariably gifted warriors, for their intellects find even the exacting disciplines of the Swordmasters almost childishly easy to master. Similarly, each Loremaster has a faultless grasp of the principles of magical lore. However, he seldom wastes time in committing more than a sliver of battle magic to memory, being more concerned with weightier and more elusive spells that are little suited to the battlefield. Within the Tower of Hoeth can be found many disciplines of art, magic and war. Most scholars confine themselves to studying but a single path, honing their skills until perfection is achieved. Even amongst the rarefied Elven ranks, it is unusual to find an intellect capable of mastering an entire path, let alone show accomplishment in several, but it is not impossible. Such is the achievement that marks out a Loremaster from a mere scholar.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh2_main_unit_long_text_hef_cha_mage	In Ulthuan, those who devote their lives to magic are treated with the highest respect and honour. Though each kingdom has its own magical traditions and methods of scholarship, Saphery is the realm most famed for its mages, and it is at the White Tower of Hoeth that Ulthuan's seat of magical learning can be found. There, the greatest collection of Mages, Loremasters and scholars in the world endeavour to perfect their mastery of the sorcerous arts. It is a place of wonders unbounded, where mages strive to harness every aspect of the Winds of Magic.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh2_main_unit_long_text_hef_cha_noble_0	High Elf Nobles are the leaders of their own respective armies and companies, warriors whose skill at arms and years of experience far surpass those of any other mortal race. The noble families of Ulthuan have led the High Elves through times of peace and conflict for thousands of years. They pride themselves on a deep sense of honour, as well as the mastery of both diplomacy and war as art forms. The High Elves believe an existence lived without precision to be hollow, and scarcely preferable to death. Any Elf noble is just at home fighting with a sword in bloody melee as he is loosing deathly-accurate arrows from afar, or even dictating the strategy of a campaign from a greater distance still. Though they are loyal to the Phoenix King even unto death, all High Elves of noble blood love intrigue and politics. Unfortunately, this sometimes means that armies are trusted to individuals based on political alignment, rather than on ability. Fortunately these instances are rare -- when the safety of Ulthuan is at stake, few Phoenix Kings have suffered such idiocy for long. There is no shortage of brave and talented commanders among the Asur, and courtly intrigue seldom prevents such individuals from harnessing their skills.	false

The fame of those twin brothers extends throughout Ulthuan and into the lands beyond. Born into one of the oldest families of Ulthuan, the brothers can trace their line back to the doomed Aenarion, first and mightiest of the Phoenix Kings of Ulthuan. It is their destiny to perform mighty deeds and shape the fate of kingdoms. Teclis is Tyrion's twin brother, but two more different siblings would be hard to find. Where the curse of Aenarion has yet to leave an obvious mark upon Tyrion, it has made his brother frail and caustic. Indeed, so feeble is Teclis that his body can only be sustained by the consumption of magical potions. Yet no-one, least of all Tyrion, sees Teclis as the weaker twin - his destiny merely lies along another path. Teclis has been blessed with a talent for magic that makes him preeminent, not only amongst the mages of Ulthuan, but in the whole world. Though it is little acknowledged in Naggaroth, the Witch King accedes that Teclis is his superior and, since the Battle of Finuval Plain, has taken care not to come into direct conflict with his younger cousin. It is even claimed that Teclis' power approaches that of the great Necromancer Nagash, so it is fortunate that he has devoted his life to thwarting the powers of Chaos and death. 	false

It is no coincidence, then, that each of the mountain passes is guarded by a massive fortress, built around equally the massive gates through which the High Elves control access to Ulthuan’s interior – Dragon Gate, Griffon Gate, Phoenix Gate, Unicorn Gate, and Eagle Gate. Each fortress maintains a sizeable garrison whose duty it is to defend their gate to the very last Elf should the Druchii – or indeed anything else – come calling with host in tow and an aggressive intent. The Gate Guards populating its garrison are highly skilled in the operation of the various traps and war engines positioned at strategic choke points around the battlements and atop the gates themselves, adept at all forms of hand-held missile weaponry, and masters of hand-to-hand combat, lest any attackers achieve the unthinkable and begin to break through the extensive fortifications.	false

Deep within lies the Chamber of Days. On its ancient walls, it is said, are the histories of past, present and future, etched in words of fire. Legend tells that any who behold that wall shall forever be cursed with the knowledge of their own death. Regiments of Phoenix Guard are always found where the fighting is fiercest and victory hardest won, for their gift allows them to see confluences and crux points upon the battlefield that lie hidden to mortal eyes. Each warrior knows his appointed hour of death, but none seek to delay that fatal moment. Whether battle brings victory or defeat, life or death, the Phoenix Guard fight on without fear.	false

Each has studied warfare and personal combat for decades, or even centuries. It is even said that the highest masters of the order can slay a foe with but a touch, or kill with a single precisely-pitched whistle. When Ulthuan marches to war, none go more eagerly than the Swordmasters of Hoeth, for only in war can they truly unleash the full extent of their deadly art. As they advance, their blades blur and weave, knocking aside arrows in mid-flight and leaving trails of bloody spray wherever Hoeth-forged steel tastes flesh. The Swordmasters' greatswords are forged beneath the Tower of Hoeth, by smiths whose secrets are the envy of even the priests of Vaul. Each elegant blade is as long as an Elf is tall, yet is balanced so perfectly that, to a warrior skilled in its usage, it seems as light as a feather. So keen is the greatsword's edge, and so enduring are the enchantments woven into its blade, that its sharpness is never dulled, no matter how many helms or skulls are cloven by its strikes.	false

The histories tell that the two races have fought in one another's cause since the time of the Daemon invasion, but legend carries the friendship deeper into the past. Indeed, in some tales, it was Talyn, King of the Eagles, who bore Ereth Khial away to the Underworld at Asuryan's command. Like the High Elves, Great Eagles are haughty creatures who long remember insults, and do not suffer foolish company gladly. When High Elf armies assemble, the noble Eagles too join the battle. They swoop down upon the crew of enemy war machines, tearing them apart with powerful talons before using mighty wings to glide swiftly away.	false

unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh2_main_unit_long_text_hef_mon_moon_dragon	Dragons are amongst the oldest of all living creatures, even predating the rise of Chaos, and rode the thermals of ancient volcanoes long before warm-blooded creatures ruled the world. They are wise and aloof, viewing those around with a perspective only the eldest creatures can share. On Ulthuan, Dragons are the subjects of legends quite different to the terrifying folk tales of other lands. Without the Dragons of Ulthuan, the High Elves would have been annihilated thousands of years ago, for the Dragons are the Elves' oldest and greatest allies. Within Ulthuan, the realm of Caledor is the home of the Dragons, and in ancient days, those noble beasts seemed almost without number. However, times have changed. Now, in colossal caverns found deep within the Dragon Spine Mountains, the Dragons sleep away the centuries. A mysterious languor that began in the earliest years of Tethlis' reign has caused more and more Dragons to enter a slumber from which only ancient Caledorian songs can rouse them. Few young Dragons are hatched now on Ulthuan. The youngest are referred to as Sun Dragons, in reference to their hot tempers and the rich, warm hue of their scales. Those that surpass the Sun Dragons in might and enlightenment are known as Moon Dragons. The oldest and most powerful are referred to as Star Dragons, for they are truly as ancient as the very stars of the firmament. While any Dragon can savage an entire regiment of warriors, tear a Manticore apart or rip the head off of a Wyvern, a Star Dragon is so physically powerful that it can battle against even the Greater Daemons of Chaos and prevail.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh2_main_unit_long_text_hef_mon_phoenix_flamespyre	The Phoenixes of Ulthuan dwell amongst the Flamespyres - great alabaster pillars of rock that stand sentinel about the Shrine of Asuryan. These constantly burn with magical flame, for Aqshy - the Wind of Fire - gusts about these rocks as it is drawn inexorably towards the Isle of the Dead. Yet Aqshy has left its mark on more than the silent stones. Over generations, the Phoenixes have become attuned to fire magic, harnessing it at whim. When a Flamespyre Phoenix is enraged, its plumage explodes into a magical flame, causing the creature to leave a trail of angry fire in its wake. Should one be slain, it explodes, leaving naught behind but a shower of flaming cinders. If the Winds of Magic ebb, the creature perishes, as all living beings eventually must. Yet if the air is sufficiently suffused with magic, the fiery fragments swiftly recoalesce; with a booming inrush of air and a flash of searing light, the Phoenix is reborn to fight anew.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh2_main_unit_long_text_hef_mon_phoenix_frostheart	As a Flamespyre Phoenix ages, its body cools, and even begins to sap heat from its surroundings. Finally the plumage that once blazed with fire grows heavy with frost and ice. Once this occurs, the Phoenix must leave the Flamespyres, for the chill that surrounds it causes agony in its brightly burning kin. Most such Frostheart Phoenixes dwell in lonely exile on crags about the Eataine Coast until their bodies finally freeze solid, to leave curious frozen statues along the crags and cliff tops. The ice that sheathes its form is as hard as glass, and its enemies find their own strength and resolve eaten away by its chilly presence. Knowing they can no longer resurrect themselves in magical fire, the Frostheart Phoenixes fight even harder in the defence of their homeland, determined to end their existence striking a final blow against the enemies of Ulthuan.	false

unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh2_main_unit_long_text_lzd_cav_cold_ones_feral_0	Cold Ones are rapacious predators, fuelled by a savage blood-lust that drives them to attack any warm-blooded creature that comes near. They hunt in packs, and are perfectly capable of bringing down creatures many times their own size. As soon as they become aware of their prey, the pack will surge forth, some of their number harrying and snapping at their quarry, while the rest of the pack swings forward to left and right. Once surrounded, the unfortunate victim will quickly be dragged down and consumed. Cold Ones can be broken to the saddle, and are used as cavalry mounts by both the Dark Elves and Lizardmen. However, breaking them in this way tempers their normally savage nature, and although still ferocious compared to most mounts, it leaves them dull-eyed and sullen compared to their wild cousins. For this reason, Wizards will sometimes bind packs of feral Cold Ones to their will with a Scroll of Binding, and then unleash them at the start of a battle to surge uncontrollably forward and savagely attack the foe. Used in this way, a large pack of Cold Ones can inflict terrible harm, while smaller packs are ideal for snapping and biting at the flanks of the opposing army.	false

A Saurus Scar-Veteran could not express why he chose a defence in depth to defeat a foe, yet he will inexorably recognise when such situations are called for and react accordingly. With only a low, grumbling growl and a final bellow, a Scar-Veteran can set an entire Lizardmen battleline in order. Once combat begins, Scar-Veterans hurl themselves into the fray with merciless efficiency. Each stroke, bite or thrust dispatches a foe, often with the enemy literally torn limb from limb by the ferocity of the attack.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh2_main_unit_long_text_lzd_cha_saurus_scar_veteran_2	Saurus Scar-Veterans, also known simply as Saurus Leaders, are the most powerful of their savage kind. More than simply eight feet of savage reptilian muscle, Scar-Veterans are perfectly designed killing machines, their martial prowess further enhanced by battle experience. To their foes, be they ancient nemesis or simply those who trespass upon the sovereign territory of their masters, the Saurus leaders are nothing less than the vengeance of the Old Ones made manifest. All Saurus Warriors are spawned with the knowledge of how to fight, and the longer each lives, the more battles he survives. The longer he survives, the more he understands the needs not just of a lone warrior, but also of an entire army.

Skinks take up weapons during their many patrols as well as to join the fighting during times of war. As troops, they range between reckless audacity and sudden panic. Their skittish nature makes them much more prone to routing than the stoic Saurus. Most commonly, the Skinks advance before the bulk of the main army, harassing the foe's advance with hails of darts. When massed together in a fighting cohort, they can bulk out a Lizardmen battleline. The volleys of javelins and darts that the Skinks can unleash are astoundingly dangerous, for they have learned to coat their weapons with lethal toxins distilled from venomous amphibians, insects and serpents that thrive in the steamy jungle and profuse swamps of Lustria.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh2_main_unit_long_text_lzd_inf_temple_guards	The Temple Guard are a revered and uncommon spawning of Saurus. They were created to protect the Slann Mage-Priests and the temple-cities in which the Lizardmen dwell. To their tasks, they dedicate every fibre of their beings, displaying a single-minded determination that will result in either the safeguarding of their charges or their own deaths. As protectors, Temple Guard are matchless. They stand sentry, silent and motionless, not even blinking their eyes. It has been known for Temple Guard to maintain such a sleepless vigil for centuries, thick layers of dust settling upon their reptilian forms - yet the ever-watchful guardians are not immobile statues, and can erupt into sudden violence should they perceive any threat to their charges.	false

unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh2_main_unit_long_text_lzd_mon_ancient_stegadon	The eldest Stegadons are the strongest of their kind. Over the ages, some of their fiery temper has cooled and, as they often outlive their Skink crews, they gradually become more accepting of new handlers. Each new team honours their beast and elder Stegadons are widely venerated. Many crews will hammer bronze or gold plates covered with glyphs into their gnarled hide, more to mark a beast's status than to provide additional protection. Likewise, on the eldest of beasts, reinforced masks are set over the creature's headcrest, and ornamental bracelets or sharp metal tips are commonly seen to cover its horns. Ancient Stegadons frequently carry fearsome blowpipes in their fighting howdahs. Each fires a cluster of darts that separates in flight to create a hail of poisoned death. It is for good reason that the Skinks name these fearsome weapons 'Sotek's String'.	false

Considered by many as the ultimate jungle hunter, with some growing nearly two stories tall, these massive reptilian beasts are powerfully built and highly aggressive creatures, with long, muscular hind limbs and a heavy tail that is used to balance their enlarged and powerful skulls. Upon scenting prey, or catching sight of even the slightest amount of movement, Carnosaurs propel themselves with enormous strides, moving with surprising speed for such large beasts. Their shortened forelimbs and sharp claws are ideal for locking hold of prey. They have massive jaws, their gaping mouths filled with dagger-like death. Their bite can hack through huge chunks of flesh on larger prey, and by twisting their thick, serpentine necks, Carnosaurs can simply rip their quarries apart piece by bloody piece. Having tasted blood, a Carnosaur is at its most deadly, for it enters a state of savage bloodlust — biting and tearing at any living creature, sometimes slaughtering its gory way through entire herds of giant reptilian without pause. Such is what they were bred to become, for the primordial jungles of Lustria only spares the strongest and most ferocious of monsters, whilst the weak are simply left to be eaten by those seeking to consume flesh.	false

When enraged, they unleash their only form of speech - a blood-curdling roar that reverberates across the jungle. During times of war, units of Kroxigors are used as shock troops to batter enemy battlelines. In combat, formations of Kroxigors and Skinks prove unusually effective, with the Skinks able to pepper foes with poison-tipped javelins before crashing headlong into combat, where they are backed up by the crushing power provided by the mighty Kroxigors.

unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh2_main_unit_long_text_skv_art_plagueclaw_catapult	It was in the Southlands that crude torsion devices first began hurling loathsome substances onto the foe during battle. The Plague Monks learned to deliver their pestilent payloads via catapult, the erupting splatter of deadly contents slaying targets in a toxic storm. Those splashed by the semi-congealed liquid find their skin simultaneously sloughing off in ruin and elsewhere erupting in glistening spores. Armour offers no protection against such a loathsome weaponry. Plagueclaw Catapults are great, wheeled scaffold-towers bearing catapults. Pushed into position by ragged Clan Pestilens acolytes, the claw-like arm of a Plagueclaw Catapult is winched back and unleashed to lob hideous death. The toxic semi-liquid leave a glowing streak across the sky as it arcs earthward.	false

This wonder weapon generates unearthly energy, which is directed along a rune-etched barrel forged and enchanted to channel such destructive fury. When fired, the Warp Lightning Cannon emits a sizzling ball of Warp-energy. Any near the shot are rocked in its wake, fur standing on end, with a sickly green light burnt into their mind's eye. The bolt arcs earthwards, punching through anything in its path and then erupts in a crackling cloud of pure Warp lightning. The shot flashes too quickly to follow, but its trail, once it lands on the ground, is easily marked - scorch signs follow its path and anything in the way will have a gaping hole in the exact shape of the beam.	false

The few who know of the existence of the black-clad Assassins fear them above all others. Rumours of their cut-throat abilities are whispered in fear: the Clan Eshin devils are invisible and their very shadows are poisonous. The art of sabotage, arson, and poison all form part of an Assassin's deadly bag of tricks. Many Assassins-in-training are lost as the regimen is gruelling. The final tests are death missions assigned by Clan Eshin's ruling council, presided over by Lord Sneek, the leader of the clan and one of the Lords of Decay. After surviving such actions, an Assassin is considered an acknowledged master in the methodology of murder.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh2_main_unit_long_text_skv_cha_grey_seer_plague_0	The Grey Seers are also known as the Chosen of the Great Horned One, prophets of the Lord of the Great Below, and the voice of the Horned Rat. They are powerful sorcerers, capable of channelling eldritch energies in destructive ways, levelling enemy armies with lightning, or summoning ravening swarms of rats. Some Grey Seers ride atop the nightmarish Screaming Bell to unleash untold ruination. More important than their ability to dominate a battle, however, is their role as emissaries for the Council of Thirteen, a position which often grants them the top-rank. Having the backing of a Grey Seer means a clan is in ascendancy, and will gain supremacy in dealings with others. They may barter with the upper hand and a Skaven with an advantage will press it mercilessly. It is always best to exploit such an advantage while it lasts, for it will only be a matter of time before the Seers call with their own demands.

Plants wither and die where Skrolk treads and the very air about him seems to congeal and darken, as if stained by his baleful presence. Skrolk is ancient, having existed many spans of even the most long-lived of his foul kind. Rather than weakening with age, he is possessed of a diabolic vitality that belies the years and the heaped diseases he carries. Indeed, he is bent and gnarled under the weight of countless corruptions. The flesh that is not hidden by his tattered shroud is leathery and covered in a layer of dripping buboes. Even worse, the mysterious hunching growths framed by the robes promise something still more virulent. Each new pox only toughens the aged Plague Monk, who has himself become a walking disease.	false

That Queek has risen so high in arguably the most powerful Warlord clan is a credit to the terrible violence he unleashed on any in his way. Queek's vicious streak and vitriolic temper, along with his immense ego, are legendary amongst Skaven, who regard such traits as greatly admirable. Although his scarlet-armoured Stormvermin often accompany him, Warlord Queek takes pleasure in personally dispatching enemy leaders. In his arrogance, he carries the severed heads of his latest opponents on a trophy rack to remind followers - and Warlord Gnawdwell - of the fighting prowess of the almighty Warlord Queek, the Headtaker, the Dwarf-smiter.

For the other races of the world it is hard to differentiate or define where the science stops and the power of magic begins, although such delineation never occurs to Skaven. Warlock Engineers see the two elements as one and the same - machines and sorcery blended together to create impressive killing power. The sorcerer-inventors often go to war carrying many of their latest devices. From hand-held weapons such as warlock muskets or poisoned wind globes of devastating potency, to blades powered by crackling Warpstone energies, the anarchic arsenal of the Warlock Engineers is both varied and destructive.	false

unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh2_main_unit_long_text_skv_inf_plague_monk_censer_bearer	Only the most insanely devoted of the Plague Monks are given the honour of wielding a plague censer - the deadliest weapon in the Clan Pestilens armoury. A plague censer is a hollow spiked metal ball attached to a length of chain. In an unholy ritual, a Plague Priest reads aloud disturbing and disease-ridden passages from the Book of Woe while a shard of Warpstone is placed inside the cruelly-spiked globe. A ladle's worth of vile contagions is added, poured over the Warpstone itself. Hellish runes glow as the devil's concoction immediately begins a slow bubble, sending tendrils of greenish vapours wafting out from the many holes in the ornate iron orb. Contact with the haze of noxious fumes emitted from a gently swaying censer will cause flesh to erupt into sores and fluid-filled blisters. When swung in the heat of battle, however, the censer emits vast billowing green clouds. Exposure to this plague fog causes horrific damage as lungs instantly fill with virulent fluid and vital organs putrefy. It would take a creature absolutely devoid of common sense to be anywhere near such a weapon, much less wield it in battle. Enter the Plague Monk Censer Bearers...	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh2_main_unit_long_text_skv_inf_plague_monks	The Plague Monks of Clan Pestilens are zealots utterly dedicated to the spread of corruption and decay in the name of the Great Horned One. These devout disciples of disease are unique amongst Skaven society in that they are fanatically committed to their clan and its purpose of creating the ultimate disease. Once this plague devastates all surface-dwellers, the Skaven can rise up in the ruins and claim their proper inheritance - nothing short of the entire world - and the Great Horned Rat will know who brought his children to their rightful and preordained ascendancy and Clan Pestilens will sit over all and reign supreme. As the foul brethren march forward towards an enemy battleline, their chanting picks up its pace and the Plague Monks seem to incite themselves into a terrible rage. In combat Plague Monks hurl themselves into the fray with a fanatical ferocity, eager to bring death and destruction to their foes. They relentlessly attack with filth-encrusted blades, iron-tipped staves, or even their needle-sharp teeth. A Plague Monk's exposure to pestilence has rendered its toughened, boil-ridden skin immune to pain. The ability to shrug off crippling injury combined with their near-hysterical zealotry means that the only reliable way of stopping a Plague Monk attack is to wholly dismember them.	false

unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh2_main_unit_long_text_skv_inf_warpfire_thrower	Warpfire Throwers are one of the deadliest weapons within the arsenal of Clan Skryre, a weapon so powerful and dangerous that it is considered the hallmark of Clan Skryre ingenuity. The Warpfire Thrower is a crude yet highly volatile flamethrower that hurls a blast of concentrated Warpfire upon an enemy or a small area of ground. Warpfire Throwers are almost always grouped into teams of two Skaven; one carries a bulky and highly unstable fuel-tank filled with chemicals mixed with powdered Warpstone, while another aims the weapon at the enemy. With a single flick of a switch, a torrent of fuel will be unleashed that ignites into a greenish flame. Once the blast hits any solid object, the Warpstone imbued flame that the weapon spews forth sticks to almost any surface. Nearly nothing can douse the flames of a Warpfire thrower once it has engulfed its intended victim.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh2_main_unit_long_text_skv_mon_hell_pit_abomination	The Hell-Pit Abomination is a living mountain of misshapen flesh. The creature moves in a rippling tide of unnatural spasms, writhing like a worm and using its many limbs to pull and drag its hideous bulk forward. Various mechanical bits, such as wheels, cogs, and fluid-pumps have been grafted into the beast to ensure it moves at optimal speed and that the Warpstone mutated growth agents are regularly injected into the beast's hyper-fast metabolism. A multitude of heads dart out of the lumpen mound of muscle and bone at the behemoth's fore. The heads that snake out are all vermin-like, but some glisten hairlessly, like unborn rat monstrosities. Many have eyes, but no few are blind, twisting and craning to catch the scent of prey, hissing and snapping at the air with razor-sharp incisors. Many foes will flee from the unnatural sight of a Hell-Pit Abomination. Once in combat the Hell-Pit Abomination is relentless, dragging its bulk onwards to crush any in its wake. Hell-Pit Abominations are notoriously hard to slay and there are accounts of the beasts visibly healing wounds, regrowing severed limbs and rising from the dead to attack again.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh2_main_unit_long_text_skv_mon_rat_ogres	The hulking monstrosities known as Rat Ogres are one of the most successful of Clan Moulder's numberless creations. The Master Moulders have found the perfect blend of death-dealing creature through a mixture of foul crossbreeding and dark sorcerous surgery. In their artificial making, many beasts are literally stitched together, the impossible feat accomplished through the fusing powers of a powerful Warpstone-derived balm, the infamous skalm. The Rat Ogre combines the speed and ferocity of a Skaven with the sheer brawn of an Ogre. Somehow the desperate hunger of both races has been magnified as well - for the Rat Ogre is truly a ravenous creature, forever seeking to gorge its fill on fresh meat. In battle a Rat Ogre pack is horrifying to behold, becoming wholly consumed by an insatiable instinct to kill, rip, and tear, and it takes a Packmaster to steer their ferocious charges. A Rat Ogre pack moves with great speed, their misshapen bodies made entirely of straining, bulging muscles, teeth, and claws. The snarling rage of a Rat Ogre pack colliding with an enemy unit resounds across a battlefield, as the towering creatures splinter shields, snap bones, and relentlessly pound any and all opposition.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh2_main_unit_long_text_skv_veh_doomwheel	Few devices sum up the blend of science and sorcery, the sheer inhuman ingenuity of the Skaven, than the infernal war machine known as the Doomwheel. At first sight the Doomwheel might seem an oddity, perhaps even comical to opponents that have not faced one before. The Dwarfs, who have suffered many wars against the Skaven, know full well the Doomwheel's measure and will direct every war machine at their disposal to blast the deadly wheel apart before it can churn close enough to pulverise the Dwarf battlelines. Indeed, Dwarf cannons will allow themselves to be overrun by the foe, willingly sacrificing themselves for their Hold in order to get off a single shot at the infernal Skaven device. When it works correctly, the Doomwheel whirs quickly across the battlefield, moving more swiftly than galloping horses. If it is going exceptionally well, the Warlock Engineer will even steer the great wheel towards the enemy. This is ideal, as the powerful Warp-lightning bolts fire out, blasting the nearest thing to shrivelled blackness, so it is best to be nearer the foe!	false

Whilst such abilities are as nothing compared to the evil sorceries of true Necromancy, their morbid association with death forever taints Amethyst Wizards in the eyes of the common folk. They are particularly loathed by the Priests of Morr, who are deeply suspicious of the Amethyst Wizards’ penchant for lurking near their cemeteries. Indeed, the halls of the Amethyst College are akin to a great necropolis, with a stench of death constantly lingering around it.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh2_pro08_unit_long_text_neu_cha_felix	After many adventures at his Dwarf companion’s side, Felix Jaeger has the appearance and physique of a weathered swordsmen. In his capacity as a poet and writer, he drunkenly made an oath to the Slayer Gotrek Gurnisson to be his ‘rememberer’; to travel with him and record his exploits in prose, then to finally detail his inevitably epic death. The trouble is, Gotrek’s continual, accidental avoidance of his own end has led the pair to spend a number of years living a nomadic existence of heroism and adventure, one which has taken them to all corners of the world. As a matter of honour, Felix follows Gotrek on these suicidal forays with disinclination, but through his experiences has become an adept combatant who approaches his predicaments with logic and careful consideration, whether it be in battle or otherwise – a far contrast from his brutal, absolutist companion Gotrek!	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh2_pro08_unit_long_text_neu_cha_gotrek	For the Dwarf Slayer Gotrek Gurnisson, only death will serve as atonement for his past sins. Fate has been cruel, for his continual failure to achieve the ultimate doom he craves has led him to deadlier and deadlier encounters, each time ending in the vanquishing of a seemingly insurmountable enemy in a monumental duel. In Gotrek’s time wandering the world, he has slain some of the world’s most dangerous foes, including brutish Orcs, pernicious Skaven, Giants, Trolls, Dragons, Sorcerers of Chaos, Dark Elf Corsairs and many, many more. Though his history before becoming a mohawked Slayer is a mystery even to those closest to him, it is certain that many more enemies of the Forces of Order will be cut down by the blade of his mighty Rune Axe before the day of his doom – if ever it comes, of course!	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh2_pro09_unit_long_text_grn_cha_black_orc_big_boss	The Black Orcs who reach the upper echelons of their brutal martial hierarchies pride themselves on being the best fighters found anywhere in the Greenskin tribes. In reality, tribes exclusive to the war-obsessed Black Orcs are rare and it is often the case that smaller Black Orc bands work their way into the other Greenskin tribes – but only serving others when the purpose suits them. More often than not, when the pickings are rich they will stay and work towards supplanting the tribe’s current leaders. Being the biggest and toughest fighters, it usually isn’t long before Black Orcs are no longer following orders, but beginning to issue their own as the undisputed Warbosses and Big Bosses of all they survey. Like lesser Black Orcs, the elites amongst their kind don heavy armour and ironshod boots while brandishing ‘eavy choppas’. Uncharacteristically for Greenskins, they take great care in repairing and sharpening their war equipment between battles, eschewing the usual post-battle activities indulged in by Goblins and regular Orcs such as skull-stacking contests, punch-ups, and other indulgences of frivolous debauchery. 	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh2_twa02_unit_long_text_wef_cha_glade_captain	The culture of the hunt is strong in Athel Loren and finds its way onto the battlefield. One such example is the tradition of the Wood Elves not to launch themselves into battle until one of their highborn Captains has loosed a shot at the heart of the enemy leader. This duty is allocated before the battle begins, and the firer is granted the honorary title of ‘Talon of Kurnous’. Seldom does the Talon’s arrow kill the target, though Glade Captains are amongst the few to have the skill to even come close. Such is not the intent, rather it is a reminder of mortality for the foe, and a final entreaty to the Hunter for his blessings.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh2_twa03_unit_long_text_def_cha_rakarth	Amongst the Dark Elves there have been many famous Beastmasters in the past, but Rakarth, the Beastlord of Karond Kar, has no equal, living or dead. Leading an army of monsters and beasts unlike the world has ever seen, Rakarth dons a tall helm that accentuates his slender form but covers most of his facial features. None, however, can mistake the light shining from his eyes like coals in the night, betokening an intrinsic power to project fear and instil subservience into his monstrous minions. Mounted upon a saddle lined with human skin, Rakarth soars into battle atop Bracchus, an ebon-scaled Wyrm said to be one of the most cruel-hearted Black Dragons to ever take to the sky.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh2_twa04_unit_long_text_bst_cha_great_bray_shaman	The innate, dark magics of the Great Bray Shaman twist the very fabric of reality around their foes. Wielding a rugged staff, pulsating with mystical energy, the repugnant aura of Chaos and sorcery that surrounds them infects everything it touches. Their position is sacred among the Beastmen. With fell rituals and blood sacrifice, they invoke the powers of the Dark Gods and imbue the whole brayherd with raging fury and unconquerable vigour.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh3_dlc20_unit_long_text_chs_aspiring_champions	Aspiring Champions are often the best any Chaos Warrior can hope to become, since the unending peril of fighting in a Chaos host means that few progress any higher. Those who achieve champion status will eliminate anyone they see as competition, butchering any promising underlings to ensure their continued station in their God’s hordes. As a result, many form their own warbands until they achieve their goals or meet their end by the blade of a rival. Those on this long and often doomed path are obsessed individuals, only recalling the most pertinent details of their past, and many assume new identities to replace those lost to them.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh3_dlc20_unit_long_text_chs_chaos_chariot	Chaos Chariots are drawn by a pair of huge destriers swollen to unnatural size by the corrupting energies of Chaos. Each of these beasts is clad in tempered steel plates in the manner of their unholy masters. As these deadly creatures gain momentum, balefire flickers from their eyes and nostrils, giving the impression that the chariot has galloped straight from the realm of nightmares into reality. The hellish steeds plough through the enemy ranks with ease, iron-shod hooves trampling bodies and fanged maws snapping at exposed flesh. All the while, charioteers stab and slash from their fighting platform, maiming and decapitating those nearby with their cruel blades and spiked whips.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh3_dlc20_unit_long_text_chs_chaos_knights_all_und	Chaos Knights are feared throughout the Old World and beyond as merciless butchers capable of turning the course of battle with a single charge. They are towering brutes atop immensely powerful Chaos Steeds, rider and mount clad in thickest plate, each section of armour crafted by a master Daemonsmith. Even their frightful reputation is a weapon in its own right, crippling those who would stand against them before a single blow is struck. Each is a paragon amongst his warrior brethren, for he has trod the path of damnation for many years and holds the favour of the Dark Gods.	false

Khorne cares not to also gift an innate mastery over these creatures, for if a Knight is not worthy to tame and break the beast himself then he is not worthy to fight in His hosts. For those that fail in this task, the Blood God will allow His 'gift' to tear their bodies apart, break their bones to marrow, and devour them. 	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh3_dlc20_unit_long_text_chs_chaos_knights_mnur	Like their fellow acolytes of the Plague God, the Knights of Nurgle’s hordes are always infected with all manner of disfiguring diseases. They are driven forth by a strange and morbid energy, enabling them to survive wounds that might otherwise slay another Chaos Knight. Their originally splendid wargear, coats of arms and banners are always tattered and filthy, like the rags of a leper, and their once-opulent silk or fur cloaks hang from their shoulders like the shroud of corpses. The Knights of Nurgle bear their disfigurements openly, proud of their dribbling sores and discoloured skin at odds with their exalted positions on the battlefield.	false

It is a predisposition that fuels the blind adoration of those who go to war alongside them, as well as the fear of those unfortunate enough to face them. With immensely powerful Chaos Steeds and ostentatious suits of armour, these warriors are proud of the unwholesome gifts that Slaanesh blesses them with. From their high horses, they bathe openly in the praise heaped upon them by those they regard as lesser mortals.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh3_dlc20_unit_long_text_chs_chaos_knights_mtze	The Knights of Change are mighty and terrible warriors, not bred only from the ranks of the northern tribes but also from the lands of the Empire, Bretonnia, Tilea and Estalia who have turned apostate, abandoning their native lands for the dubious favours of Tzeentch. Many were individuals of great importance and temporal power in their former lives, such as statesmen and nobles, while others were famous Templars or renowned military men. Atop their great Chaos Steeds, they carry ostentatious weapons in a grotesque echo of the illustrious Knightly Orders to which many of them once belonged.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh3_dlc20_unit_long_text_chs_chaos_lord_all_und	Of all the mortal warriors across the civilisations of the world, Chaos Lords are the most feared, for they are truly like gods amongst men. Clad in baroque armour and rich furs, they tower above even other champions of Chaos, who are but feeble children by comparison. A Chaos Lord's indomitable will is forged in the fires of war, their skills tempered and honed in the crucible of battle, and their blades eternally quenched in blood. They are not only exceptional fighters but also merciless conquerors, great leaders and wily strategists, their names spoken in hushed whispers across the lands of the civilised, their violent deeds written in the blood of their enemies.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh3_dlc20_unit_long_text_chs_chaos_lord_mkho	Many throughout the world have proven themselves great leaders in times of war, but there are some who display a natural aptitude in the talents of death and set their sights beyond an existence of fighting solely for their hearth, kith and kin. The life of a Lord of Khorne is the life of a true follower of Khorne; discarding all mortal concerns to exist solely to lead the hosts that serve His ends. They may have once used the armaments taken from their places of origin, but with the Blood God’s favour comes unearthly armour and weapons of dark design that replace these mortal arms.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh3_dlc20_unit_long_text_chs_chaos_lord_msla	The Lords of Slaanesh are some of the most dangerous of all His mortal servants, both as warriors of appalling ruthlessness and demagogues of alarming skill. In this way they have proved themselves not only in combat, but also in their devotion to the Dark Prince. They spread their Master’s depravity amongst the foolish and the unwary, promoting such extreme heresy and deviance as to be an affront to nature itself. The history of their deeds makes for grim reading: entire towns and cities slaughtered to the man and massive armies slain, each corpse’s face contorted in perfect agony at its final moment of suffering.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh3_dlc20_unit_long_text_chs_chaos_sorcerer_all_und	Those champions of Chaos who seek mastery over the magical arts are known as Chaos Sorcerers, and they are madmen and malcontents all. They are amongst the most awful and depraved of all servants of the Ruinous Powers, for they long ago sold their souls in exchange for the heady elixir of pure power. Where many of the world's Wizards, such as those taught by the Colleges of Magic in Altdorf, glean their arcane skill from long years of painstaking research, a Chaos Sorcerer's understanding of the Winds of Magic is often instant and innate. Without the patience and wisdom that such study brings, an inexorable descent into deformity and madness is nigh on inevitable.	false

Clad in decaying Chaos armour and rotten robes, their bodies are host to a hundred ailments, their incantations able to cause flesh to blister and skin to slough from muscle. They can enchant worms to infest a victim’s organs, consuming him slowly from within, and can rain down boiling bile from the sky. They also have the power to regenerate injured flesh, scabbing over wounds in a mockery of Shallya’s blessings. When at the helm of Nurgle’s hordes they often seize prisoners for sacrifice, sparing them but infecting them so that they may spread plagues as refugees.	false

They may lead an entire warband of fellow disciples or Daemons of Tzeentch, manipulating the talents of their followers as easily as they manipulate the Winds of Magic in service to the Great Conspirator. They may also take up advisory positions to Tzeentchian Lords, although the scheming and manipulative nature of Chaos Sorcerers usually leaves little doubt as to who wields the true power. Masters of the darkest magic, they are rightly feared, for to face one in battle is to know that your very soul is in jeopardy.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh3_dlc20_unit_long_text_chs_chaos_sorcerer_msla	There are many reasons why one versed in magic might sell their soul to the power of Slaanesh. Perhaps they were a former wizard who felt impotent compared to his peers, succumbing to his desires for greater power. Others, delighting in their creations and cantrips, may have fallen into a pattern of excess, devolving over time until their greed transformed them into a puppet of Slaanesh. Some are shamans from the harsh north who, through prayer, mutation, or sheer luck, became attuned to the Winds of Magic and were taken by the Dark Prince's influence. Whatever their origins, Sorcerers of Slaanesh are masters of the most dire and secret arts.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh3_dlc20_unit_long_text_chs_chaos_warriors_all_und	Answering the call of Chaos, many a great fighter has journeyed to the frozen north to throw in their lot with the hordes that muster in the Wastes. They do so because they feel a deep connection with the Ruinous Powers, evident by some form of corruption affecting the minds, bodies, or both. Once pledged, they have no need of food, drink or sleep, for they are nourished by the carnage they wreak. They have nothing but contempt for the weak and the cowardly and go about the business of murder with a vengeance, for there is always a part of the warrior who was that rages against the Chaos Warrior he has become.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh3_dlc20_unit_long_text_chs_chaos_warriors_mkho	The Warriors of Chaos that follow the Blood God, as with all servants of the Ruinous Powers, are not limited to the primitive tribes of the north. His grasp can reach the heart of every soldier, every warrior, every life-taker. When a noble Knight of Bretonnia or a Templar of the Empire falls to His worship it is because they forget why they kill. To change from killing for the common good to killing only because one wants to – because the act is pleasing – is when the righteous have fallen from their path. These are the warriors Khorne embraces, never to release. These are the converts that He savours.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh3_dlc20_unit_long_text_chs_chaos_warriors_mnur	An unbearable stench always heralds the approach of the Plague Lord’s warriors. Their helmets often bear great, withered horns and they are clad in rust-tarnished armour which conceal vile conditions or mutations – perhaps a slimy tentacle, or translucent, jelly-like flesh that reveals their decaying inner organs, or simply a body riddled with leprosy. Sometimes the corpulent meat of their bodies spills from the cracks of their armour. Whatever the case, they are deadly fighters who are near-impervious to pain and fight on despite receiving the most horrendous wounds imaginable.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh3_dlc20_unit_long_text_chs_chaos_warriors_msla	Chaos Warriors dedicated to the Dark Prince of Chaos are regarded by His lesser warriors as walking avatars of their God. They truly walk the path of damnation and excess, the strongest fated to become His chosen or mighty champions if they survive their ordeals. Although armour-clad, many leave portions of pale flesh bare as if to titillate opponents with the illusion of weakness, inviting them to attempt to strike at imagined weak spots. Consumed by their own dark passions, they appear distant and something other than human. Their followers bathe in this otherworldly glory, driven by the need for the great warriors’ approval to commit further atrocities.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh3_dlc20_unit_long_text_chs_chaos_warriors_mtze	Chaos Warriors of Tzeentch tend to be subtly individual, with many small differences between them. Typically their plate armour and shield will be engraved with intricately patterned sigils that radiate with raw power, or flow with blinking eyes or gibbering mouths, or are perhaps inscribed with a minute arcane text making the wearer literally a walking grimoire. Though it is not immediately visible, many will have mutated flesh, their Chaos armour melting and reforming around the warped appendages of their bodies. They are deadly and unpredictable; they are warriors who have the favour of the God of Magic.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh3_dlc20_unit_long_text_chs_chosen_all_und	There are those amongst the ranks of the Chaos Warriors who bear the favour of the Dark Gods more than their fellows. Known amongst their kind as 'Chosen', their frames are swollen with unholy power and gifts bestowed on them by the Dark Gods in recognition of the many fell deeds they have committed. These gifts are as varied as any other aspect of Chaos, but most mutations tend to be useful as weapons that aid the quest to inflict devastation on the civilised realms of the world. Even if a Chosen bears no such stigmata, it is clear that he carries the grace of the Dark Gods from his aura of dark menace.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh3_dlc20_unit_long_text_chs_chosen_mkho	Those who are physically marked by the Blood God will have set themselves apart from their peers through the fellest of deeds, yet many will not have the mental fortitude to take on the gifts that come with being a Chosen of Khorne. Only the strongest avoid devolving into mindless, gibbering Chaos Spawn, instead becoming destined to grow free of their mortal shackles to gradually take on a more impressive form. Whatever the precise gifts bestowed, these mighty warriors are invariably filled with a mere portion of Khorne’s rage, yet it drives them endlessly into combat like those possessed to reap skulls or die a glorious death.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh3_dlc20_unit_long_text_chs_chosen_mnur	The sane shrink from contagion in all its forms, but those who become favoured by the Plague Lord are far from sane. When one becomes Nurgle’s Chosen, His mark appears on the body as three circular lesions, typically weeping poisonous pus or infested with wriggling maggots. Despite this perceived displeasure, it is a blemish sought by and reserved for His most loyal servants. Most individuals develop a supernatural tolerance to pain, despite their festering flesh, allowing them to enjoy the slow degeneration without distraction. They also become inured to battle wounds, making it very difficult to slay them – some have to be chopped to pieces before they die.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh3_dlc20_unit_long_text_chs_chosen_msla	From amidst the nightmarish hosts of Slaanesh there are those whose deeds fighting in His service have been rewarded above most others. They are the Chosen of Slaanesh, who have laid countless lives and souls at His altars and brought Ruination and debauchery to the forces of Order and Nature. Their skin bears His marks, their icons festooned with sigils and images of their devotion. But above all they become physically primed for war, their augmented frames covered in armour inlaid with empowering runes, and their mighty weaponry inscribed with blasphemous blessings of the Dark Prince.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh3_dlc20_unit_long_text_chs_chosen_mtze	Despite his position as the God of Magic, Tzeentch, like His brother-Gods, indulges frequently in warfare and favours some warriors over others. To His Chosen He grants not only augmented physical ability and equipment, but also an innate awareness in strategy. Where Khorne’s Chosen comprise of supremely powerful and savage warriors intent on acts of unbounded violence, the Chosen of Tzeentch are more effectively used as part of grand, complex strategies. They are highly cerebral fighters known to plot their manoeuvres so quickly and elaborately that it often appears to their enemies that every eventuality had been planned for ahead of the battle.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh3_dlc20_unit_long_text_chs_daemon_prince_mkho	In order to walk Khorne’s path of glory and become one of His irrepressible Daemon Princes, one has to have a long and unrivalled history of murder, and lived a life dedicated to war without compunction or pause. Mortals found worthy by the Blood God undergo this transformation, becoming a hulking creature bulging with slabs of iron-hard muscle. A tail, horns, and a claw are added to the gifts of Chaos and mutations they earned in life, which are scaled up to their new stature. They become savage, bellowing creatures, with a bloodlust that extends far beyond what they once felt as mere mortals.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh3_dlc20_unit_long_text_chs_daemon_prince_mnur	Nurgle’s mortal champions, who excel in bringing plague and Ruin to civilised lands, are sometimes rewarded with Daemonhood. It is a rare occurrence, for most die long before they pile enough worm-riddled corpses high upon His decrepit altars. For those who achieve the transformation, their bodies enlarge as horns, talons, tails, and sometimes wings sprout from their changing forms. All manner of contagion erupts over their new bodies, yet they treasure each festering cyst and scabrous blister more than ever. In the mortal realm, their leadership is rarely questioned at the helm of Nurgle’s hordes, venerated as veritable gods but forever to be glorified slaves of the Plague Lord.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh3_dlc20_unit_long_text_chs_daemon_prince_msla	Tales from the Liber Malefic tell how once-great warriors, consumed by their desires and temptations, literally transformed in front of others. At the moment of these startling alterations, skin fell from muscle, bone reshaped, wings and horns sprouted, and all manner of foul appendages surfaced. Slaanesh had elevated them to become creatures as perverse as any of His Greater Daemons: Daemon Princes, with physical traits similar to the other Ruinous Masters’ equivalents but lither and far more graceful in their actions. They are always at the forefront of the Dark Prince’s hordes, whipping troops into the lust of battle, caressing senses with words, and tearing through flesh with masterful strikes.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh3_dlc20_unit_long_text_chs_daemon_prince_mtze	Only the most treacherous, deceitful, manipulative and dedicated of Tzeentch’s servants will ever achieve the glory of becoming one of His Daemon Princes. When a mortal is gifted such a transformation, they grow immeasurably in size, sprouting a long, snaking tail of sinewy flesh, and large horns from their distended skull. A casual swat of their murderous talons can kill a man, and their former humanity gives them a far greater understanding of those that serve them than other Tzeentchian Daemons. Thus they use this knowledge ruthlessly to corrupt and manipulate their pawns to achieve their goals.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh3_dlc20_unit_long_text_chs_exalted_hero_mkho	Some do not come to worship Khorne merely because their lust for combat compels them to do so; there are those who have drawn His gaze because they have murderously rebelled against the grain, but proven themselves strong and brutal enough to face the subsequent wrath. They have killed, and enjoyed killing. And they have survived. Survived the wrath of allies, of enemies, survived the blood-soaked path laid before them by the Blood God. They have purpose and ambition; they have a thirst that needs sating and they are strong enough to have gone to extraordinary lengths to satisfy it. They are exalted and they are deadly.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh3_dlc20_unit_long_text_chs_exalted_hero_mnur	Those who walk their own path to excel themselves in service to Nurgle are destined to become His most exalted soldiers. With weapons sweating with necrosis, corroded armour, and shields inscribed with runes to ward away harm, they wade into battle as readily as they duel champions of rival Gods. But their true purpose is to inflict decay upon the civilised realms of the world, as harbingers of war-borne plagues in the frame of a mighty warrior. They are truly the grimmest of combatants, finding fulfilment in the horrors of battle and believing that suffering and misery are the natural state of life as expounded by Grandfather Nurgle.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh3_dlc20_unit_long_text_chs_exalted_hero_und	The frozen north forges some of the hardiest warriors in all the world. Each is a paragon of deadly ability and lethal intent. Some ascend to command entire nations, some pursue the esoteric paths of the arcane, but the majority dedicate themselves to little more than the brutal butchery of all who stand in their way. These ruthless killers are known as Exalted Heroes, their histories recorded in scattered chronicles by the free people of the Old World as a catalogue of woes and evil deeds. Their infamy shines bright as they capture the notice of the Dark Gods of Chaos with ever-greater feats of slaughter.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh3_dlc20_unit_long_text_chs_forsaken_mkho	When the warping forces of Chaos saturate the mortal frames of Khorne’s warriors beyond the limitations of their flesh, they become His Forsaken; deformed, twisted warriors that know nothing but rage. Such changes may bring them closer to the image of Khorne or the spawn of His realm, and go beyond mere strength. Their skin may turn black, red or brass, and their eyes become as dead and white as Daemons'. Their very faces may become the hideous likeness of a Bloodthirster, Bloodletter, Fleshhound or Juggernaut, their eyes may leak poison, or they may be granted the most disfiguring boon of this sort with their entire bodies becoming a hybrid breed of such Daemon spawn.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh3_dlc20_unit_long_text_chs_forsaken_mnur	Nurgle is a being of entropy and as such, can warp mortal flesh at will. Those who dedicate themselves to Him might seek such changes as a sign of His favour, though it is more common for them to succumb to their rebellious flesh and devolve into some repugnant form of mindless mass. The Plague Lord favours mutations that reflect his aspect of decay; His warped devotees may have the head of a dung beetle or fly, their tongue may have transformed into a writhing slug, or they might ooze necrotising slime from every pore. The more revolting the mutation, the more pleasing it is to the Lord of Decay.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh3_dlc20_unit_long_text_chs_forsaken_msla	Slaanesh, being the most capricious and wantonly cruel of the Ruinous Powers, takes great delight in the happy accidents that come about from the warping changes His supplicants suffer from receiving His gifts. Such changes may be in body, but for those without the sufficient mental fortitude, their resulting forms are also reflections of souls broken by excess. Those doomed to such a fate will have lived at least some of their lives exceeding mortal limitations, so by the time Slaanesh’s changes takes hold all that remains is a soulless husk driven by the hollow desires of one who has both imposed and endured unimaginable forms of suffering.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh3_dlc20_unit_long_text_chs_forsaken_mtze	Only the desperate or the utterly mad offer their souls to Tzeentch, and some who do are irrevocably altered in body as well as mind, never to be the same again. The Great Schemer oft ensnares His followers with spurious promises only to forsake them later, gifting madness to the mind and mutation to the body. Of all the Chaos Gods, the Changer of Ways is surely the most generous with the reward of mutation. While some of His followers glorify in their tainted flesh, others experience mutation after mutation piled onto their frail bodies, their ravaged minds diminishing into nothing more than those of crazed killers.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh3_dlc20_unit_long_text_chs_marauder_chieftain	Marauder Chieftains are a daunting sight, brooding hulks of muscle and hair whose bodies are covered in the scars and trophies of battle. They are typically a great warrior, subservient but loyal to their tribe’s king, pledging his devoted service in return for hunting grounds, warriors, treasure, and thralls. When the horns of war sound, they are expected to come forward and lend the command of his warriors for the cause. Chieftains are the most battle-hardened killers of all Marauders; products of a people so steeped in conflict that, even in times of prosperity, they will fight to the death for the honour of leading the next raid.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh3_dlc20_unit_long_text_chs_marauder_horsemen_all_und	Some tribes of Marauders hold horses in high esteem, while others regard them with fear and superstition. To many, a warhorse is a sign of status, and only the best warriors may ride them. The steeds ridden by these tribes are powerful beasts, foul-tempered and strong of limb. Once a rider has broken such a horse, it will remain loyal to him until death, but they remain vicious and unruly should a stranger approach. Fed on a diet of human flesh and watered-down blood, these snorting, high-spirited steeds have a glint of intelligent menace in their eyes, and will trample, kick and bite as if berserk when engaged at close quarters.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh3_dlc20_unit_long_text_chs_marauders_all_und	The tribes of Northmen that flock southwards with any Chaos invasion are known by those in their path as Chaos Marauders, natural fighters born into hardship and brought up in a world where surviving each day is no small victory. They have no time for plough or sickle, for their tools are the axe, the sword and the shield. What their own lands cannot provide, they simple take from the lands of lesser men. They have little fear of dying in battle, for they know that they fight under the scrutiny of their gods, and that cowards are beneath their deities' notice.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh3_dlc20_unit_long_text_chs_marauders_mkho	Amongst the savage Northmen there is barely a tribe whose warriors do not include those who honour the Blood God. The lifestyle of Marauder societies near places such as Troll Country or the wild Steppes dovetails neatly with the behaviour the Blood God expects from His followers. Marauders who choose to worship Khorne simply view His patronage as a practical consideration, for those who pay tribute to their dread Lord quickly find themselves blessed with strength and ferocity. However, every lowly devotee of Khorne finds himself on a road to an all-consuming bloodlust that only the most strong-willed can resist, and only the very best can hope to sate.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh3_dlc20_unit_long_text_chs_marauders_mnur	Many Marauders offer sacrifices to the Lord of Decay as precaution against illness, but there are those that completely entrust their souls to His care. When epidemics ravage the northern tribes, some chieftains and shamans decree that their only chance of survival is to devote themselves to the Plague Lord. In return for their lives, they champion Nurgle with sword and flame against rival tribes and the hated realms of the south, the marks of their survival borne by their pallid, pockmarked skin likely to also be branded with His three-circled symbol.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh3_dlc20_unit_long_text_chs_marauders_msla	When the tribesmen of the Serpent sweep down from their northern climes to raid fairer lands, they, more than any other Marauders, debauch themselves with rape and pillage. Before raids and battles they quaff vast quantities of alcohol, and the consumption of rare hallucinogenic plants and roots is commonplace. This renders them mostly oblivious to pain or fear and encourages them to luxuriate in even the greatest dangers. Where the servants of Khorne care nothing for the pain and misery they inflict, the Serpent’s ensure their weapons are sharp to satisfy the cruel inventiveness of their twisted minds to toy with their victims before dispatching them.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh3_dlc20_unit_long_text_chs_marauders_mtze	Tzeentch is a popular God among tribal shamans and Sorcerers, but tribes who worship the Great Eagle as their sole patron are uncommon. Most Marauders prefer the bloodiness of Khorne, the glittering prizes of Slaanesh, or the resilience gifted by Nurgle. What Tzeentch’s warbands lack in numbers, however, they make up for with cunning. They make use of guile in unison with their brawn, using tactics more akin to guerrilla warfare to destroy their enemies. Carrying totem banners of powerful magic into battle, they are perfectly capable of causing immense suffering to their enemies.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh3_dlc20_unit_long_text_chs_mon_warshrine	Ever conscious to have their actions catch the eye of their diabolic masters, the Ruinous hosts bring blasphemous icons and unholy relics to battle upon vast Warshrines. Large altars mounted atop iron platforms are borne aloft by lumbering mutant beasts of burden, who themselves fight with unholy fervour. As man and beast alike wreak slaughter in their patrons’ names, they pay tribute by condemning the souls of the slain, offering up prayers and sacrifices through their altars in the midst of battle like sweet nectar to the Gods. The presence of a Chaos Warshrine empowers the warriors that fight before it, the blessings of the Ruinous Masters manifesting in the faithful nearby.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh3_dlc20_unit_long_text_kho_cha_valkia	Valkia the Bloody rose to infamy as the merciless warrior queen of a great northern tribe who cut down anyone who dared question her reign. By the time of her death she had defeated countless minions of Khorne’s brother-Gods, reaching the end of her mortal existence while on a journey of slaughter into the Realm of Chaos to pay tribute to her battle-hungry patron personally. The Blood God raged at Valkia’s passing, His fury so thunderous that it awoke her from death and, taking her in His claws, He reforged the queen into a vision of destructive power.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh3_dlc20_unit_long_text_nur_cha_festus	Stalking the northern forests in moth-eaten robes clinking with vials of unimaginable concoctions is the muttering, shuffling figure of Doctor Festus. Once a prolific curer of plagues in Nordland, he made a desperate pact with Nurgle after encountering a strain of Gnashing Fever he could not stem. Thus the Plague God filled his brilliant mind with every detail of every ailment known to the mortal world, washing away his compassion and replacing it with an intimate knowledge of disease and a desire to experiment. Though his curative powers are greater than ever before, woe betide the fool who crosses the Doctor, who delights in force-feeding his latest creations to unfortunate victims.	false

After betraying his liege-lord, he fled to the Northern Wastes where he rose quickly in the Pleasure God’s favour for his treachery and acts of debauchery. After smashing a ten-thousand strong host of Khorne and slaying its mighty Champion in equal combat, Azazel attracted his master’s gaze once more and was elevated to a state of Daemonhood.

After praying fervently to Tzeentch to reverse their fates, the runt awoke to find that his body and that of his sibling had melded together, with Thomin reduced to a drooling automaton enthralled to Vilitch’s command. With his magical abilities enhanced a hundredfold and a hulking body, the Twisted Twin wreaked his vengeance upon those who had looked down upon him, while enslaving the minds of his tribe’s warriors so that they would live and die according to his whims.	false

Raiders and robbers by disposition, they get lured into service as mercenaries, but are effectively treated no better than unpaid servants by their new Lords. They are, if anything, more skittish and even less reliable than their unmounted counterparts, but this tendency is deemed to be outweighed somewhat by their usefulness in the raiding expeditions that travel into unfamiliar and hostile lands, where their mobility can often provide a stark advantage.	false

Oglah Khan is one of the vassals of the Great Khan, and enjoyed the favour of the green-skinned despot. His tent is as large as the hall of any human noble, and he owned a hundred wolves, making him a very wealthy Hobgoblin. In times of war he can summon six hundred spears to battle. Oglah has fought in many battles for the Great Khan, and become widely known for his prowess in combat and his treachery – traits admired by all Hobgoblins.

Once the most potent Sorcerer to walk the Plain of Zharr in a thousand years, his body now succumbs to petrification, an indication of his slowly waning powers. His legs having long ceased to work, Ironhand has constructed a mechanical device by which he is transported from place to place, and his completely petrified hands have been replaced by machinery grafted to his body. These contraptions were constructed by Astragoth's thralls to plans of his own  design, combining the undoubted engineering skills of the Chaos Dwarfs with his own dark, twisted science.	false

Their lore is terrible and ancient, and involves the study of machines, and the mastery of forge-craft, weapon making and the terrible Chaos magics gifted to them by Hashut.

For centuries, the master of this dark demesne and the warriors within it has been Drazhoath the Ashen, a twisted, power-hungry creature and potent Sorcerer.

He has also been lucky as the hardened scar tissue that criss-crosses his massive bony shoulder hump testifies. Fated... Lucky... Sneaky!

By far the most common workers in the Chaos Dwarf realm are Greenskins, and this is not simply because they are native to the Dark Lands and its bordering mountains, but also because they are hardy creatures who will often last the longest in the noxious fumes and murderous conditions under which they are made to labour. Of course, there's no way that sneaky, tricksy Greenskins can simply be left to their own devices, and certainly not on the battlefield.

Their sorcery and engineering are legendary, from the great obsidian and basalt towers and ziggurats drawn forth from the earth, to the steam-hissing engines that crush rock in the mines and the baroque armour which adorns the Chaos Warriors of the north. All are evidence of the Sorcerer-Prophets' dark knowledge made manifest.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh3_dlc23_unit_long_text_chd_cha_zhatan_the_black	Acts of the most cruel and heartless nature are everyday occurrences in the Plain of Zharrduk. Thousands of slaves endure unimaginable agonies in the pits of Zharr, mining out the poisonous wealth amidst choking fumes and impenetrable darkness. In the workshops of Zharr-Naggrund untold labourers are worked to death in their chains so that their masters can enjoy a lifetime of ease. The Hobgoblin overseers in the Vale of Woe beat their pitiful charges so that their flesh hangs from their backs like bloodied rags. Even amongst such wanton cruelty there is one whose deeds of brutality are remarkable: Zhatan the Black, Commander of the Tower of Zharr.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh3_dlc23_unit_long_text_chd_inf_chaos_dwarf_blunderbusses	Chaos Dwarfs generally fight with one of two weapons, both equally destructive in their own way. The first is the double-handed axe, a short-hafted weapon with a heavy metal blade which can crack open armour and cleave a foe in two. The second is the blunderbuss, a short-ranged weapon of devastating effect. The blunderbuss uses a gunpowder charge to fire shards of spiked iron at the enemy, although it can also fire hot coals, lead shot, pieces of scrap metal, and even stones if need be. The weapon is so robustly made that it can be loaded with far more powder and shot than a simple handgun, and its effect is quite different.	false

unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh3_dlc23_unit_long_text_chd_inf_chaos_dwarf_warriors	Chaos Dwarfs are an unnerving sight in battle. They are brutish, grotesque figures plated in black or burnished armour of heavy plate and jagged scales, crowned with tall helms mounted with flame tongue-spiked crowns or sharpened horns. Their livery is bright and bloody, and their distorted faces, if they are seen at all, are bestial and filled with malice. Their presence is intended to inspire fear in their foes, and they have lost none of the toughness or skill-at-arms of their western Dwarf kin. To them there are few greater pleasures than the bloody sundering of a foe be it by crushing axe-blow or the flesh-shredding volley of blunderbuss fire.	false

unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh3_dlc23_unit_long_text_chd_inf_goblin_labourers	Even though their numbers have steadily increased down the long centuries, the Chaos Dwarfs are still few, and are far outnumbered by those over whom they claim dominion through might and cruelty – their Labourers. The Chaos Dwarfs consider all life other than their own kind to have value only as raw resource and fitting sacrifice, and to them the muscle, sinew and souls of those that bow and scrape and cringe before them are no more than a commodity to be amassed, exploited and spent. Without labour from without, Zharr-Naggrund would not have been built and its vast industries could not be maintained. Even now, the need for fresh-blood and workers only increases with each passing year. Goblins are the most common among the labour forces as well as the most obedient, due to their conniving nature.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh3_dlc23_unit_long_text_chd_inf_hobgoblins	The Hobgoblins are a distinctive sub-species of steppe-dwelling Goblins found only within the lands of the Far East, in the rolling, untamed plains of the Eastern Steppes. The Hobgoblin race are considered traitors by all of their Greenskin cousins, not because of their unbelievably treacherous nature, but by their specific betrayal of the Greenskin Uprising of Zharr-Naggrund. This betrayal of their entire race and their inability to even trust each other has ensured that the Hobgoblins have become utterly enthralled to the brutal protection and patronage of the Chaos Dwarfs. Though hated by their kin, the Hobgoblins are nonetheless the scourge of the steppes; feared, hated and powerful in almost equal measure, and also widely abhorred for their cruelty, wickedness and appalling standards of hygiene.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh3_dlc23_unit_long_text_chd_inf_infernal_guard	The Infernal Guard as it is known, is amongst the most legendary warrior-cult within the Chaos Dwarf Empire, having the sworn task of defending the citadel to the death from any that would assail it, and to carry out the will of the Lord of the Black Fortress without question. The Infernal Guard's ranks are made up from Chaos Dwarfs to whom some stain of dishonour or failure has been attached, an occurrence which in their unforgiving society can result from merely being close kin to a failed battle commander, knowing defeat under the eyes of a Sorcerer-Prophet, presiding over labourers who have revolted or a furnace that has exploded through overuse.	false

unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh3_dlc23_unit_long_text_chd_mon_bale_taurus	In form, no two Bale Tauruses are ever quite alike, and the mightiest of them are truly massive beasts that never die except by violence. All bear the overall semblance of a huge, winged, Daemonic-bull whose flesh burns with the intensity of a living furnace sufficient to wreath it in smoke and spark the ground afire beneath its hooves, and against which arrow and blade alike perish to cinders. To many, the burning wrath of the Bale Taurus is little more than a myth, for sustained by the fires of the Dark Lands, they seldom stray far from their lairs. But those that inhabit the Dark Lands know better...	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh3_dlc23_unit_long_text_chd_mon_great_taurus	The Great Taurus is a huge and terrifying monster with the body of a massive bull and membranous wings like a Dragon. These creatures are stabled in great pens beneath the Temple of Hashut, the bull god of the Chaos Dwarfs. Powerful Chaos Dwarfs ride Great Tauruses into battle, the creatures burning with a terrific intensity, so that their whole bodies are wreathed in fire and smoke. Indeed, so angrily and hot does their skin burn, swords and axes become molten and blunt in the very process of striking it. When Great Tauruses move across the ground, sparks and lightning fly from their hooves. The beasts breathe fire in great snorting bursts, leading to the Chaos Dwarfs sometimes calling them the "Red Bulls of Hashut".	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh3_dlc23_unit_long_text_chd_mon_kdaai_destroyer	Far larger than the K'daai Fireborn fashioned as shock troops by the Chaos Dwarfs, K'daai Destroyers are massive constructs created in the form of mighty warriors or iron beasts, such as gargantuan monstrous bulls and other nightmarish creatures, awakened by mass blood sacrifice and let loose upon the enemy. The High Priests of Hashut have succeeded almost too well in the creation of the K'daai Destroyers, for they are near-mindless, elemental forces of destruction, and need to be laid to rest as cold and silent metal until they are in battle, where they burn bright and terrible, but briefly.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh3_dlc23_unit_long_text_chd_mon_kdaai_fireborn	The desires of Chaos Dwarf Sorcerers and Daemonsmiths are for power and domination, and for weapons and soldiers that will make them invincible – and it is from this desire that the K'daai Zharr; the "Scions of Fire," were born. Rather than summon uncontrollable Daemons or parley bargains with the Greater Daemons of Chaos, with the K'daai they have sought to do something more, to create a race, half-Daemon essence and half-raging fire, drawn from the magma of the deep earth and birthed in the boiling blood of Hashut's burning sacrifices, given form and contained within an armoured framework of articulated iron and rune-stamped bronze.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh3_dlc23_unit_long_text_chd_mon_lammasu	The Lammasu is a Manticore-like Chaos creature with the body of a gigantic bull, a powerful mace-tipped tail and a massive, ugly head. The Chaos Dwarfs believe that it is a rare mutation of the Great Taurus, a creature who is said to be less of a beast, but rather a manifestation of the Dark Land's rage. The Lammasu is a creature with magical properties, which breathes not ordinary air but the enchanted power of the Winds of Magic. As it exhales, whirling clouds of black sorcery are emitted, which wreathe themselves around the creature, ensorcelling it with protective power against hostile spells. The Lammasu is the favourite mount of the Chaos Dwarf Sorcerers.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh3_dlc23_unit_long_text_chd_veh_deathshrieker_rocket_launcher	The Deathshrieker Rocket Launcher is one of the most diabolic and destructive weapons ever created, for bound within its munitions are howling, malevolent fire-spirits harvested from the cinders of Hashut's sacrificial altars, and it is the hellish shrieking of these spirits when loosed that gives the weapon its name. The Chaos Dwarfs utilise a number of these different types of gunpowder-driven rocket weapons, ranging from shoulder-fired chain-dragging harpoons used to bind and bring down Lava Trolls in the magma caverns deep beneath the mountains, to massive warheads launched on pillars of fire to break enemy fortifications. The packed, multiple warheads of the Deathshrieker detonate in the air above the battlefield in a storm of fire – fire which has its own terrible hunger for life. Screaming, fanged tendrils of flame plunge downwards, actively seeking out victims. The tormented spirits are far from discerning as to whose flesh they burn, and the Chaos Dwarfs must be cautious in its use, lest their own suffer from such a wrathful weapon.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh3_dlc23_unit_long_text_chd_veh_dreadquake_mortar	Dreadquake Mortars are amongst the largest and most effective of all the mighty siege weapons deployed by the Chaos Dwarfs. They rank alongside other such mighty arms, capable to rend the earth and smash through layered stone fortifications as if they were kindling. The Dreadquake's deadly projectiles are fired by steam pressure generated by a boiler and contained within a pressure vessel – conventional gunpowder being far too dangerous given the volatility of the Dreadquake's unique and powerful shells. As a consequence it takes quite a while for the machine to generate enough steam to fire a single shot – limiting its potential in battle. However, even on the open field it is a supremely dangerous weapon when ranged against large and static targets, and if succesfully fired against enemy infantry, it can wreak carnage, as more than one Orcish tribe of the World's Edge Mountains has found to their cost.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh3_dlc23_unit_long_text_chd_veh_iron_daemon	The Iron Daemon is one of the latest Daemon Engines created in the service of the Chaos Dwarfs. It is a mighty, smoke-belching powerhouse that fires blasts of shrapnel against enemy forces or crushes fortifications while towing up to two heavily-armed steam carriages. The boilers that provide these machines with motive power to haul heavy armaments and munitions to the battlefield are cunningly designed so that they can also be used to work pressure-fed weapons such as cannonades and wall-breakers. This means that every Iron Daemon is also a powerful war machine in its own right – a fully mobile artillery piece or murderous killing engine, able to smash through fortifications and hack down ranks of living soldiers with equal ease.	false

unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh3_dlc23_unit_long_text_chd_veh_magma_cannon	The Magma Cannon is a fiendish weapon first conceived of for use against the ravening Trolls and other unwholesome and hungry monsters that spawn and multiply in the Dark Lands, for it is something of a cross between a field artillery piece and a furnace. It is designed to spew molten metal and fire upon its victim, horrifically burning them to death. The Magma Cannon has seen long use and been the subject of considerable modification and experimentation by Chaos Dwarf Daemonsmiths. No two are quite the same, but rather the product of an individual's malign creativity. Some use pressurised steam-boilers to jet gouts of burning sulphur, caustic tar or pyretic acids, while others incorporate sorcerously-bound volcanic glass shells, in which molten lava drawn from the deep earth slumbers until its shell is shattered.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh3_dlc23_unit_long_text_chd_veh_skullcracker	One of the latest designs to see widespread service within the Chaos Dwarf empire is the Iron Daemon, a compact, armoured steam-driven traction engine, designed for hauling heavy armaments and munitions to the battlefield and to work pressure-fed weapons such as cannonades and wall-breakers. In addition to those it tows to the battlefield, the Iron Daemon may be equipped with weapons such as the Skullcracker, designed for crushing fortifications and walls – a hissing, grinding arcane-mechanical conglomeration of iron hammers, hacking blades and brutal picks to pulverise and shred anything unfortunate enough to be caught in front of it.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh3_dlc23_unit_long_text_ksl_cha_ulrika	Ulrika Magdova Straghov is the daughter of Ivan Mikelovitch Straghov, one of the Kislevite march boyars who guards the borders of that frozen realm against the depredations of Chaos. She is a tall, independent woman, as ferocious in combat as any man, skilled with the bow, and an accomplished horsewoman to boot. Once he had awoken the Eye, Adolpus Krieger finally turned Ulrika, against her will, into a Vampire. After a while, she found herself taking increasing pleasure in the draining of her blood as well as, reluctantly, Adolphus' conversation, as he told her of all the people he had met and places he had been...	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh3_dlc24_unit_long_text_chs_chaos_lord_mtze	The legions of Tzeentch are not as numerous as those of wrathful Khorne, and do not possess the unholy resilience of those belonging to His rival, Nurgle. Nonetheless, when the Great Conspirator is ascendant, His war leaders are gifted with the preternatural ability to perceive and react to a dozen different futures. Those few who succeed upon the twisting path of Tzeentch become the most otherworldly of all Chaos Lords, leading His hosts with distinction. They are blessed with both exceptional martial skills and the arcane strength of the Lord of Magic, a deadly combination which makes them both cunning leaders and lethal warriors, who command their armies with uncanny presence.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh3_dlc24_unit_long_text_chs_exalted_hero_mtze	The Exalted Heroes of Tzeentch are ostensibly the most bizarre and macabre of the Lord of Change’s mortal servants. Their armour is typically Tzeentchian, inlaid with bands of gold and bluish-silver and assembled from strangely curving components, but it is the God of Magic’s generous gift of two extra heads that sets His Exalted Heroes apart from others on the battlefield. It is a change that irrevocably affects the mind, splitting a Hero’s mortal personality into three conniving extremes. With eyes sealed shut, the central head jeers the whims of the two other personalities dwelling in the leering cyclopean heads on either side. Yet with a singular will, the creature swings its Great Axe with Tzeentch-imbued strength.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh3_dlc24_unit_long_text_cth_cha_celestial_general	Only the most powerful warriors of Cathay's armies rise to the rank of Grand General of the Celestial Host. These individuals are often Dragon-blooded, though not always, for the Dragons are willing to reward valour and obedience in any of their subjects. Regardless of their origins, each Celestial General is a skilled fighter, and as befits their rank carries weapons and armour gifted to them from the armouries of Wei-Jin. They lead from the front in battle, leaving strategy and trickery to the likes of Wizards and magistrates, their presence in the thick of the fighting inspiring the armies of the Dragon Emperor.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh3_dlc24_unit_long_text_cth_cha_gate_master	The professional soldiers in the Cathayan army are known as Jade Warriors; their leaders are known as Gate Masters – veteran troops of myriad wars in the service of the Dragon Emperor, trusted implicitly by the local Lord Magistrates. As their name indicates, Gate Masters know best how to defend their cities from Cathay's many enemies from without. Part of their skillset involves intimate knowledge of the surrounding terrain, and therefore how the foe may attempt to exploit it in order to break in. 	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh3_dlc24_unit_long_text_cth_cha_saytang	To the people of the Southern Provinces, it is known simply as "The Watcher"; to others it is "The Heavenly Bowman" or "The Guardian of the Sky". However it is known, Saytang is the Great Sentinel, standing atop the Mountains of Heaven, towering even above others of its kind. Those who have faced Saytang in battle and lived did so by running from the field in abject terror, for its enormous stride enables the Watcher to leap great distances, even from mountainous peak to peak, always poised to smite the enemies of the Dragon Emperor.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh3_dlc24_unit_long_text_cth_cha_yuan_bo_human	Amongst his siblings, the Jade Dragon is known as the most skilled manipulator of the Winds of Magic. For this reason, he leads the Astromancers of the Celestial Court, the only sanctioned Wizards of the realm. Some of his family may consider him a bureaucrat, given the diligent execution of his administrative duties, but his power runs far deeper and further than they could know. Behind the governors and officials is a vast network of spies and agents at the Jade Dragon’s command, allowing him to seek out, identify and quickly expunge threats to the safety of the provinces. If others knew of his methods, they may be judged as harsh or extreme. But the harmony of the realm outweighs the desires of the individual, and an iron will is required to eliminate a sickness before it can fester and spread.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh3_dlc24_unit_long_text_cth_inf_onyx_crowmen	Crowmen are the agents of the Moon Empress, a form of Feng Shi Bo – familiars conjured by Cathayan Wizards crafted from the Elemental Winds of Yin. They are vicious creatures refashioned in the shape of men to spy for the Celestial Court, reporting on the state of the empire to the Moon Empress who in turn informs the Dragon Emperor. When required, flocks of Crowmen may be called to war, their speed and sharp beaks affording them a secondary role as combat-ready scouts that can discern the enemy's actions from afar.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh3_dlc24_unit_long_text_cth_mon_celestial_lion	Long thought to be imaginary beings by all in the Old World, winged lions do actually exist, far to the east in the land of Grand Cathay. Unlike their western counterparts, Manticores, Celestial Lions have been purified by the eldritch power of the Dragon Emperor himself and live under his protection on the sacred hunting grounds of the Forests of the Moon. From time to time, favoured Sorcerers are gifted a Celestial Lion by one of the Dragons to ride into battle and shred the foe to ribbons where he stands.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh3_dlc24_unit_long_text_cth_mon_great_moon_bird	The Great Moon Bird is the Moon Empress' favourite celestial creature, enjoying her noble patronage and protection as a result. Found in numbers near the highest peaks of the Mountains of Heaven, they are said to make their nests in the craters of Mannslieb, the Silver Moon, only to fly down at the Empress' behest, or that of the most powerful Astromancers in the realm. In battle, they are a petrifying sight – wreathed in "Moon Fire", silvery flames that burn Cathay's enemies to cinders at the slightest touch. Lords or Wizards of the Celestial Court are sometimes gifted a Great Moon Bird as their personal mount, though such associations tend to be brief, with the creature returning to its natural habitat after a period of time.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh3_dlc24_unit_long_text_cth_mon_jade_jet_lions	Guardian Lions are living statues crafted by the Wizards of the Celestial Court using massive blocks of jade or jet. As to be expected from a creature made of pure rock with the size and strength of a dozen men, a Lion’s close-range attacks wreak havoc upon enemies who stray into its kill-zone, although it is its effects on and against magic that are most valued by the mighty hosts of Cathay. The nature of a Lion's power is dependent on whether it is of jade or jet, with Jade Lions acting as conduits to boost sorcery and spellcasting, while Jet Lions are used for their anti-magical properties.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh3_dlc24_unit_long_text_cth_veh_zhangu_war_drum	In the respected traditions of Grand Cathay, a great drum hangs above the gates of every city, a symbol of security to all who behold it. When danger looms and the enemies of the Dragon descend, a dozen men beat the drum to call their soldiers to war, each man guided by its thundering tempo. Should the call of battle lead them further afield, the drum is carried into combat on a great cart or chariot – every beat drives the army forward, filling the hearts of every warrior with strength of purpose and unity. Those who ride to war upon its raised platform see the whole battlefield unfurl before them; as combat rages on, there is no better place from which to direct one's troops to victory.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh3_dlc24_unit_long_text_ksl_cha_druzhina	Druzhina are drawn from minor Kislevite nobility, and consist of landowning men of sufficient means that they can afford a horse, armour and weapons with which to defend the Motherland when called upon by the Tzar. As is befitting of members of the establishment, Druzhina have disdain for city-dwellers, and are keen on preserving the rural hierarchy that provides their power and status, but are also self-sufficient, resourceful and have a healthy attitude to the very real likelihood they will be killed during military service. In addition to their bow, the Druzhina's main weapon of choice is the Great Axe – very nasty, when swung with conviction!	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh3_dlc24_unit_long_text_ksl_cha_golden_knight	The Queen of Kislev's champion is known as "The Golden Knight", an honorary rank bestowed upon the finest warrior from among the ranks of the Druzhina, although Boyars or even the common soldiery have, on occasion, risen to the position. The current incumbent is Naryska Leysa, daughter of the previous Golden Knight, who was killed in battle at Tzar Boris' side. In spite of fierce opposition from her peers, Naryska was promoted to champion on merit, for she is easily the physical equal of any man and twice as determined, having learned swordcraft from the finest practitioners in the land. On the battlefield, she is a whirlwind of furious attacks born of her stubborn, prideful nature, and unmatched in single combat.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh3_dlc24_unit_long_text_ksl_cha_hag_witch	Millennia ago, the Ungols learned to cast magic without using the mutating Chaos Winds. Their spellcasters mastered techniques to manipulate, cajole, bully and bribe the many spirits of Kislev to do magic for them. However, these spirits are capricious and demand a terrible price in return: a witch’s youth. As well as wise women with [[i]]the sight[[/i]], those who suffer great loss – such as the death of a husband or child – may in one way or another also find themselves with an intimate understanding of Kislev’s tormented spirits. Hag Witches who come to power in this way often live alone, grieving for their lost loved ones and fading youth amongst the sparse thickets of the oblasts.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh3_dlc24_unit_long_text_ksl_cha_mother_ostankya	As sworn by the common folk across the oblasts, the horrifying legend of Mother Ostankya is real. While some consider her an apostate, others regard her as a guardian of Kislev who metes out her wrath against any with ill-intention against the land, be they Kislevite, foreign or supernatural. She is rumoured to have once been a powerful Ice Witch who long ago fell foul of the Ice Court – or are such legends a mockery manifested by her hatred for the covenant’s strictures? Yet in times of war, still the hag comes to Kislev’s aid, appearing beside the Motherland’s ranks – especially those left unsupported by the most rabid of Ursunite faith – commanding her cauldron’s potent shadow-spirits to hex foes in unspeakable ways.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh3_dlc24_unit_long_text_ksl_inf_akshina_ambushers	Created as a secretive military order in the reign of Tsar Alekus the Red, the Akshina became a force to feared, rooting out conspirators and eliminating them without trial or compunction. In times of war, these agents ensure utter loyalty from the generals of Kislev, often keeping them in line through fear alone. Yet the enemies of the Motherland are no safer from their machinations. Akshina Ambushers often haunt such foes with murderous intent, putting their unusual skills to use on the battlefield. As elite assassins, they stalk their enemies from afar, often making use of cover to lurk unseen, even in the heat of combat. Every quarrel from their crossbows finds its mark, piercing the heart or burrowing deep into an enemy's skull. 	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh3_dlc24_unit_long_text_ksl_inf_kislevite_warriors	The grim and hardy appearance of these men of the oblast tell tales of a lifetime of endured struggles. For nothing matters more to Kislevite Warriors than the defence of the Motherland against the insidious forces of the Ruinous Powers and the preservation of a way of life stretching back many centuries – tasks they undertake with grim determination and armed with razor-sharp halberds. They are deeply religious, cherishing the traditional Kislevite gods, but chiefly Ursun, the Bear-God, from whom they surely draw their strength in combat. Such men are also extremely loyal to the Tzar and his family, whom they consider to be important symbols of Kislev just as much as Father Bear himself.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh3_dlc24_unit_long_text_ksl_mon_frost_wyrm	Frost Wyrms are swift and sinuous creatures with the form of flightless Drakes; their fanged claws, scyth-like jaws and vicious, lashing tails are made even more deadly by their freezing breath. Hibernating during the warmest parts of the year, they venture out to hunt the herbivorous beasts of the oblasts only when the climate is at its coldest, and in times of famine have even been known to consume creatures of Chaos such as Trolls or Minotaurs. As entities of Ice Magic, Frost Wyrms are naturally aligned to the Ice Court’s Witches, who in the most desperate times will travel to the Crags to beseech the slumbering Wyrms for aid.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh3_dlc24_unit_long_text_ksl_mon_incarnate_elemental_of_beasts	Summoned through savage and secret rituals known to very few, the Incarnate Elemental of Beasts is a monster plucked from the most chilling of legends. A grotesque and towering, half-human figure, the beast embodies the ferocity and merciless hunger of the wild. Its taut-sinewed form springs and bounds with ease through the densest wood or barren moor, running down its prey without mercy or cease and gorging on their flesh in an orgy of unrestrained bloodlust. It is said that summoning such a monster bears a dark and terrible price. Yet, such is the dire need of these endless days of warfare that when the land is threatened, the price is willingly paid, and the power of this Incarnate Elemental is brought forth to devour its master's chosen prey.	false

This monstrous creation was born from some nefarious yet unknown origin, as dark energy snakes and contorts around every wound it suffers, knitting the Balewolf's form back together wherever its hide has been pierced. Yet, to cause such a wound would require a feat of tremendous strength, for the creature's skin is thicker than toughened leather, capable of turning aside blades and arrows alike. With unnatural power and massive jaws capable of crushing a man's body in two, very few have faced a Balewolf and lived to tell the tale.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh3_dlc24_unit_long_text_tze_cha_aekold_helbrass	Once a noble son of the Empire, Aekold Helbrass found his true purpose on the edge of the Chaos Wastes. There he came upon a large Chaos altar, rippling with malevolent energy. Suddenly greeted by a mirror image of himself enrobed in imperial garb, his true enemy became clear. In return for slaying his former self, he was reborn as a Champion of Tzeentch, with arcane gifts unlike anything the mortal world had seen before. Where Aekold walks the grass springs green and meadow flowers blossom, encouraging new life in a glorious act of change. When the time for war comes, no warrior of Tzeentch shall fall beside him without the Breath of Life lifting them from their knees, imbuing them with the strength to raise their blades against the enemies of fate once more.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh3_dlc24_unit_long_text_tze_cha_blue_scribes	It is said that Tzeentch once shattered into ten thousand pieces, each shard shifting to form a spell or incantation. Thus, the Blue Scribes ride their Disc of Tzeentch through realms eternal and mortal, squabbling as they seek lost fragments of their god to bind with parchment and ink. Their mission often draws them towards the tumult of battle, where the most destructive and powerful magics are used. If threatened, one of the scribes starts reading at random from the scrolls they have accumulated, trusting the hand of fate – his master – to guide him to a fitting spell for each occasion. With such powerful magics reeled off at random, a foe is as likely to be struck by multicoloured lightning as he is to be drenched by his own personal thunderstorm or transmuted into solid gold.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh3_dlc24_unit_long_text_tze_cha_changeling	The Changeling personifies the part of Tzeentch’s psyche that is the meddler, the deceiver, the trickster. He can take the form of other beings, from the tiniest of insects to the most massive of Greater Daemons. None, save for perhaps Tzeentch himself, know the Changeling’s true form, for he goes cowled and cloaked when in his own shape – perhaps even the Changeling himself has forgotten it. That so many of his pranks have caused terrible wars is no concern to him, for he loves the discord of conflict to breed more opportunities to deceive and dismay. When battle begins, the Changeling is wont to adopt the shape and skill of his foes, in turn pounding them to pieces with malicious enthusiasm and borrowed muscle.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh3_dlc24_unit_long_text_tze_inf_centigors	Beastmen are creatures of pure Chaos, and so tend to exalt all four Ruinous Powers equally. However, sometimes a she-gor spawns a whelp that is clearly a chosen one of the Changer of Ways, its fur patterned with the Mark of Tzeentch, or its horns curling to form His unholy symbol. These Centigors are as bitter and spiteful as their non-Tzeentchian kin, with a stronger resentment for their own clumsy, awkward nature, and harbouring a deep jealousy of creatures whose minds and bodies are better matched. This feeds their arcane rage and makes them much more dangerous – having been touched by Tzeentch, this is likely no coincidence.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh3_dlc24_unit_long_text_tze_inf_tzaangors	Though undoubtedly savage and monstrous, the Tzaangors are elevated above their ordinary beastkin, having dedicated themselves to Tzeentch in exchange for his darkest blessings. Evolved with a keen, if cruel, intellect, their God has granted them attunement with the arcane, allowing their strength to grow in tandem with any spellcasting that surrounds them. Shrieking and emitting shrill war calls, they fall upon every foe in a flurried rush of blades and vicious stabs, impaling their victims with savage horns. No creature is more eager to impress their duplicitous God. Thus, empowered by magic, the Tzaangors fight with lunatic energies, hoping to earn further mutations in their quest for Change.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh3_dlc24_unit_long_text_tze_mon_cockatrice	The Cockatrice is a deadly, magical beast known to petrify those that look directly into its gaze. Said to dwell in the Annulii Mountains of Ulthuan, Cockatrices are vicious beasts obviously tainted by Chaos for both their unnatural appearance and their fierce disposition in battle. In truth, the Cockatrice is not a bold fighter and prefers to lurk around the fringes of a battlefield where it can safely feast on the dead and dying. Despite the beast's inclination for self-preservation, only a very foolish warrior will attempt to corner one, because when the beast is desperate, it goes berserk, shrinking and clawing at all who approach it with maddened ferocity that more than compensates for its inner cowardice.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh3_dlc24_unit_long_text_tze_mon_mutalith_vortex_beast	A Mutalith Vortex Beast is an utter abomination of nature. A terrifying fusion of monster and magic, the creature has been twisted beyond all reason by the powers of Chaos. Wherever a Mutalith treads, mutation and madness are left in their wake. With a ball of raw magic anchored into the creature’s body, it exemplifies the tumultuous nature of change, as the seething orb of Chaos energy warps and twists everything in its path. The flesh of the Mutalith itself is forever being healed and remoulded, sucked in and poured back out again by the vortex. All the while, these same wisps of malign energy reach out across the battlefield, mutating everything they touch.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh3_dlc25_unit_long_text_dwf_art_goblin_hewer	Created by Dwarf Master Engineer, Malakai Makaisson, the Goblin Hewer is an ingenious and deadly weapon of war built from only the sturdiest materials. It is a complex machine with a simple purpose, using hydraulic systems to launch axes with lightning speed to trap the unfortunate foe in a deadly storm of metal. Once a terrifying array of axes has been loaded into the contraption, they are released in a whirling barrage of death that can slice through enemy lines with ease. While allies describe the weapon as a "rapid-firing axe-throwing extravaganza of destruction", the enemy describe it only as "certain death".	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh3_dlc25_unit_long_text_dwf_cha_garagrim_ironfist	For five generations, the Slayer Kings of Karak Kadrin laboured under dual vows. But then the son of Ungrim, Garagrim Ironfist, committed to the life of a Slayer by leaving his father's court to live amongst the hard stone halls of the Shrine of Grimnir. Embracing his sacred duties with relish, Garagrim tends the shrine and the temple's store of ancient rune-axes left as tribute by Slayers making a pilgrimage to Karak Kadrin. Though none among them match his own devastating weapons. Chained to Garagrim's wrists so he will never lose them, his twin axes were gifted to him by his father on his coming-of-age. Inscribed by a Grudge Rune and the Master Rune of Skalf Blackhammer, each axe is a statement of deadly intent, and a warning to all of Garagrim's enemies.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh3_dlc25_unit_long_text_dwf_cha_malakai_makaisson	Once a prodigiously gifted engineer of the renowned Engineers' Guild, Malakai Makaisson now serves as a Slayer, bearing the shame of a tumultuous and tragic past. As the creator of the Ironclad [[i]]Unsinkable[[/i]] and the Airship [[i]]Indestructible[[/i]] – which both malfunctioned with devastating results – he carries the weight of numerous Dwarfs' deaths on his shoulders, resulting in his ejection from the Engineers' Guild. In the wake of the tragedies, Makaisson took the Slayer Oath, though his days of tinkering and invention are not yet behind him. He continues his craft, building wonders such as the Spirit of Grungni and the infamous Goblin Hewer, in the hopes that one day his shame will be expunged in either triumph or glorious death.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh3_dlc25_unit_long_text_dwf_cha_slayer	By dint of constant fighting, some Slayers fail more than others at the task of dying in battle, becoming ever more scar-riddled and dangerous over time. Often known as Dragon or Daemon Slayers, they tend to be joined by a swarm of younger brethren from the Slayer Cult who flock towards such renowned killers, assured that a greater Slayer can always lead them straight towards foes against whom a worthy end might be made. This attraction is not altogether appreciated by the irascible and laconic Dragon or Daemon Slayer, who do not want to dare chance one of their following getting in a lucky stroke and robbing them of a glorious final blow.	false

unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh3_dlc25_unit_long_text_dwf_inf_doomseekers	Having sworn the sacred Slayer Oath, Doomseekers are honour-bound to never retreat from a fight, an unbreakable force that ploughs recklessly into the enemy while whirling their weapons madly around their heads. These Dwarfs are crazed, even by Slayer standards, giving them even more destructive and extreme capabilities. Armed with axes attached to lengths of chain, any foe unfortunate enough to stand in their way is cut down with devastating ferocity, and those who survive are often left with fewer limbs than they started with!	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh3_dlc25_unit_long_text_dwf_inf_slayer_pirates	While any seafaring Slayer would claim some association with the infamous captain-turned-pirate of Barak Varr [[i]]Long Drong[[/i]] – the most renowned Dwarf Slayer Pirate in history – some Slayers take to the seas simply because they consider it an easy means to glorious battles. After all, raiding the treasure hoards of notorious pirates and corsairs quickly earns enemies baying for one’s blood – what more can a Slayer ask for? Slayer Pirates are often seen joining the ranks of mercenary companies from Tilea to the Empire, yet in truth their mercenary work is just to keep them in the rum and blackpowder. Their true focus, which has them sail to all corners of the world, is fighting sea monsters!	false

unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh3_dlc25_unit_long_text_dwf_veh_thunderbarge	The Dwarf Thunderbarge class of lighter-than-air warships hasn't quite been perfected yet, but that doesn't stop a few intrepid Dwarf Engineers from taking them to the skies. The bomb racks, cannons and swivel guns of these amazing flying machines can wreak devastation on any enemy battleline. Fortunately for enemies of the Dwarfs, few Thunderbarges have ever been constructed and it is hard to find Engineers insane or inebriated enough to fly such dangerous constructions. In fact, it is not unheard of for the warships to stow a few barrels of Bugman’s aboard to give the crew an extra dosage of courage when needed!	false

unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh3_dlc25_unit_long_text_emp_cav_knights_of_the_black_rose	The Order of the Black Rose was founded during the dark days of the Black Plague, its longstanding association with the Cult of Morr signified by the emblazonments across its Knights' armour and barding. Justly famed throughout the land, recruitment of their elite Knightly ranks is drawn from the best warriors of the nation, a great honour which sees them outstandingly equipped at Imperial expense. Their cuirasses are often stained black, as are the heavy weapons and shields they carry, yet it is the prominent imagery of death upon them that makes them a most intimidating adversary on the battlefield.	false

unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh3_dlc25_unit_long_text_emp_cha_elspeth_von_draken	For three generations the name of Elspeth von Draken, Magisterix of the Amethyst College and Arch-Wizard of the Lore of Death, has been spoken of in hushed tones in the reeking tavern gutters and vaulted noble halls of Nuln alike. An obsessive experimenter and mystic, Elspeth goes where she will, collecting and collating a storehouse of mystical artefacts and lore, which she guards jealously. Surrounded by all manner of occult items, Elspeth has become so saturated with the force of Shyish – the Amethyst Wind of Death – that there are some who whisper she is no longer human at all. To her enemies, Elspeth seems to stand halfway between life and death, a violent spectre in human form whose magic destroys all it touches.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh3_dlc25_unit_long_text_emp_cha_master_engineer	The individuals skilled and eccentric enough to earn the position of Imperial Engineer are obsessed with designing new machines and technological marvels, eager to watch their contraptions tear through the enemies of the Empire. However it is not just their positions as inventors and suppliers of deadly weapons that make Engineers valuable on the battlefield. While not soldiers, they are still part of the Emperor's armed forces, and can often be found taking advantage of 'battlefield conditions' to snipe at the enemy with a variety of powerful experimental rifles and handguns.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh3_dlc25_unit_long_text_emp_cha_theodore_bruckner	Known as the Hound of Judgement, Theodore Bruckner serves as the First Headsman of Nuln and champion of the Countess Emmanuelle. Towering head and shoulders over the majority of Nuln's citizenry, most regard him with abject terror, for he is the personification of bloody-handed justice and death incarnate to the Countess' political enemies. Both savage and skilled, he is famed most for his prodigious – some say inhuman – strength. Gossip surrounding Bruckner's physical prowess became the stuff of legend following his judicial duel with the noted swordsman Lord Hanz Kraster, during which he grappled his plate-armoured opponent, lifting him and aloft and snapping his back with his bare hands!	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh3_dlc25_unit_long_text_emp_cha_wizard_metal	The soaring eagle is symbol of the golden Wind of Chamon, and is considered by outsiders as a representation of the Gold Wizard’s assumed superiority over their fellow men. In truth, Gold Wizards are aloof in the extreme and the powers they wield on the battlefield do little to dispel such beliefs. It is speculated that they indulge in intellectual vanity to compensate for their often-marred physiques, as constant tinkering with acids and molten metals has left some students of Chamon scarred, burned or mutilated, leaving only their minds with any claim to perfection. Those who successfully unlock Chamon’s secrets, however, do so with frightening results, learning the ways of transmutation to warp armour and weapons to ensure victory for their sides.	false

unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh3_dlc25_unit_long_text_emp_inf_marksmen	Master Engineer Leon Todmeister is credited with creating this modified Hochland hunting rifle, brandished by the exceptional Marksmen of the Imperial Army. Originally dubbed Leon Todmeister's Fantabulously Far-reaching Harquebus of Unforeseeable and Unperceived Bereavement, it was said that he could put a hole in a gold coin at 400 yards. It was also said, however, that Leon's assistant had a bag of pre-holed coins with him at all times. Whatever the truth may be, none can doubt this rifle's deadly efficiency, nor the elite training of the Marksmen that wield it in defence of their homeland.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh3_dlc25_unit_long_text_emp_inf_nuln_ironsides	One of the most lauded institutions in Nuln is the Imperial Gunnery School, a College of Engineers rivalled in the Empire only by that of Altdorf and operators of the largest cannon-foundries anywhere west of the World's Edge Mountains, save for the Dwarfs’. Apprentices and military men from across the Empire and beyond are drawn to study at the Gunnery School, many of whom make their way into its ‘Iron Companies’, that operate as its armed wing. Most numerous among these are the Ironsides, regiments of handgunners consisting of apprentices and retainers who are fitted out in a panoply of black-iron plate armour, reflecting the wealth and status of their patrons.	false

unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh3_dlc25_unit_long_text_emp_veh_marienburg_land_ship	Designed by Gunnery School Engineer, Hezekiah Guttman, the Marienburg Land Ship was proposed as a whimsical boat-shaped alternative to a Steam Tank. As much a project of vanity as one of defence, the end product was a grotesquely-sized, hulking contraption of war, dubbed "The Wonder of the Age" by the provost-marshal of the Imperial Gunnery School. Hastily mimicked designs later commissioned by Imperial forces never quite matched the awesome firepower of the first Land Ship, though it has not stopped them rolling to war when their great expense can be spared. Traversing battlefields on huge, sturdy wheels, Land Ships dwarf the men that fight beside them, providing devastating firepower for the Imperial war effort.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh3_dlc25_unit_long_text_emp_veh_steam_tank_volley_gun	The Masters of the Imperial School of Engineers constantly design new experimental weapons systems with which to outfit the Empire’s Steam Tanks. One such modification incorporates a modified steam-powered version of the highly successful but notoriously unpredictable Helblaster Volley Gun, replacing the standard steam-powered cannons. This has proved to be devastating, often as much to the Engineer himself as to the enemy, and is particularly effective against well-armoured targets. Some of the older School of Engineering members oppose their use, for they see the mounting of Volley Guns on Steam Tanks as far too great a risk. However, these fears are generally outweighed, for the destructive potential of the weapon is formidable by any measure.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh3_dlc25_unit_long_text_kho_cha_karanak	Karanak is the three-headed Flesh Hound that prowls Khorne’s grand throne room. He never sleeps, for like the Blood God’s unreasoning vengeance Karanak is ever watchful. Each of his heads tracks his quarry in a different fashion: The first head can follow the trail through physical space, tracking the victim over plains, forests, mountains, and all environments too bizarre to describe. The second can follow the scent through time, back into the past to the very creation of everything that is, or forward to the end of the universe. The third head tracks the quarry via its own thoughts, pursuing through dreamscapes and delusions. Of the three heads it is the last that is most dangerous, for the other two can be fooled by those with the wit to do so, but only the insane can run beyond the trace of their own mind.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh3_dlc25_unit_long_text_nur_cav_rot_knight	Chaos Knights are feared throughout the Old World and beyond as towering, merciless butchers capable of turning the course of battle with a single charge. Yet some of those marked by Nurgle bear an even more striking countenance. Disfigured by disease, the Plaguelord's Rot Knights ride into battle atop vomitous Rot Beasts – the most rabid of Chaos Warhounds that have been plagued and corrupted by Nurgle to become enlarged, slavering mounts whose bites hideously infect those unfortunate enough to survive their encounters with them. Upon these horrible creatures, Rot Knights revel in spreading Nurgle’s maladies at the tip of a sepsis-inducing lance.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh3_dlc25_unit_long_text_nur_cha_bray_shaman_wild_chieftain	Old and beaten down by time, Grukmur is a Bray-Shaman born of the most wild and terrible magic. Countless scars have made a tarnished canvas of his skin, marking him as a surviving veteran of more battles than he ever hoped to a be part of. Such endless tribulations have left him drained by fear and the weariness of ages, yet Grukmur once again finds himself dragged into combat by the braying of his kin. They march to war on the sweet promise of slaughter and meat, and if Grukmur hopes to avoid the ire of his betters, he has no choice but to rush into battle beside them.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh3_dlc25_unit_long_text_nur_cha_chaos_lord_mnur	Nurgle’s Champions include some of the most foul and disgusting of all Chaos Lords. They are grim individuals, wholeheartedly believing their only sources of fulfilment to be little more than suffering, sickness and war – preferably all at once! Their heavy suits of armour often conceal heavily-diseased forms, yet with Nurgle’s blessings they command His hosts with otherworldly strength and resilience, fearlessly wading into the horrors of battle, bloodthirsty and plague-ridden. It is a Lord of Nurgle’s belief that to attain true understanding of themselves and the world, they must cast aside all the trappings and delusions of life to promote Nurgle’s truth: all is despair!	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh3_dlc25_unit_long_text_nur_cha_epidemius	Epidemius is Nurgle's chosen Tallyman, one of the seven Proctors of Pestilence, and the cataloguer of all the Plaguelord's myriad diseases. His path through the realms is an unpredictable one, for he goes wherever the spoor of pestilence leads him. Epidemius is busiest of all when Nurgle's power is strong, for the might of the Plaguelord is inextricably linked to the constantly shifting ebb and flow of disease. Campaigning armies, with all the poor hygiene that that entails, offer a glut of work for the Tallyman, but also present rare opportunities for his more unusual studies; it is a rare privilege to observe a mortal's decline as their body and soul is ravaged by disease, but the experience is often over far too quickly. Fortunately there are always more victims to study...	false

Gripped by delirium and madness, this distinguished Warrior of Chaos is Exalted by the Ruinous Powers, drawing the most avid worshippers of blood and carnage to his banner to wreak havoc upon the mortal realm. Though he spirals in a blood frenzy of his own making, Khargan is not without direction. He leads his warband against the forces of Order wherever they appear, and pledges himself to any cause that will lead him into the heart of violent slaughter.	false

Among these Dark Magic-users, there are few more dedicated to the cause than Ketzak Fimdirach. A Balefiend of rare skill and intelligence, he is prophesised by the Meargh to restore greatness to the Fimir clans. Thus, a glorious destiny calls him forth on a quest of great importance to understanding the deepest arcane law of the word and wreak havoc in the name of his long-overlooked race.	false

Driven by an unending greed, he forges a path built upon the backs of withered slaves and bloodied corpses. Though selfishness and disloyalty mark him as a most unreliable follower, he is not without reason. Promises of war-spoils and captives he can send back to Zharr-Naggrund to increase his own prestige are more than enough to secure his assistance... if only temporarily.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh3_dlc25_unit_long_text_nur_cha_kayzk	A bloodthirsty knight dedicated to the cause of Rot and Ruin, the Kurgan warrior Kayzk the Befouled has dedicated all to the service of Nurgle, Lord of Decay. The rotting pestilent mass that was once his flesh is untouched by pleasure or pain. Even should such feeling be possible, he could not give voice to it, for his vocal cords are no more than an open wound. Not even his soul remains to him, for it was offered to the Plaguefather as a trinket long ago. Now, Kayzk stands as nothing but a testament to the full horrors of Nurgle’s blessings.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh3_dlc25_unit_long_text_nur_cha_skin_wolf_werekin_chieftain	The tight bonds among a pack of Werekin are severed only in death, leaving scars that never truly heal. Such are the wounds of Mournhowl, a ferocious and tragic figure among his tribe, who after the brutal slaughter of his kin now lets his grief echo through the night. With much of his tribe devoured by a Giant Jabberslythe named Skraelsbane, driven to madness and tainted by the Winds of Magic, Mournhowl alone leads the survivors in their quest for vengeance. With violent retribution in his heart, his powerful form stalks the land, vowing never to rest until the blood of his pack has finally been avenged.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh3_dlc25_unit_long_text_nur_cha_tamurkhan	Tamurkhan the Maggot Lord has been known by many names, each more vile and grotesque than the last. As a powerful Chaos Lord, and one of the greatest Kurgan Champions of Nurgle in recent history, his divine patron has blessed him with the ability to burrow into almost any host, taking control of their body as if he were its puppet master. Though his reeking maggot corpse has commandeered many faces, the Ogre Tyrant Karaka Breakmountain has become a favoured host. In such a powerful body, Tamurkhan now gathers his great horde, determined to fulfil a twisted prophecy that tells of a horrific reign of terror across the Chaos Wastes and beyond. Death and disease shall run rampant in the Bringer of Desolation's wake, for his hordes are seemingly endless and bent on destroying the world!	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh3_dlc25_unit_long_text_nur_inf_pestigor	From the consumption of Plague victims to bathing in filth, nothing is beyond the unwholesome Pestigors of Nurgle. To face such creatures is a true assault on the senses, as well as one’s life – their dung-covered bodies are sparsely covered in fur that is matted and coarse, and riddled with myriad diseases of which they themselves are spared the symptoms due to their loyalty to Nurgle. Thus they retain the morbid vigour that characterises their master, their afflictions doing nothing to mar their battle-worthiness and savagery with a battle axe. The most favoured Pestigors are marked by their Tears of Nurgle: noxious secretions that ooze from their eyes, noses, ears and mouths, that they sputter upon their fleeing victims.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh3_dlc25_unit_long_text_nur_inf_plague_ogres	Plague Ogres have devolved in both mind, body and soul, their forms twisting and contorting into hellish shapes through the horrific blessings of Nurgle's Rot. When the Red Fist Tribe were defeated by Tamurkhan's horde, a great many Ogres submitted to his will and joined the monstrous host, from which point on they were lost to Chaos forever. Taking control of their Ogre Tyrant's body, Tamurkhan led them through foul rituals and the consumption of Chaos-tainted flesh, which sealed their fate. Soon, all manner of plagues and diseases were visited upon their desecrated bodies, their suffering only alleviated when they embraced Grandfather Nurgle fully. In battle, they slake their hunger and smash the foe in praise of the Lord of Decay – those that survived the Nurglish corruption, although many are barely recognisable as the Ogres they once were.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh3_dlc25_unit_long_text_nur_mon_bile_trolls	Trolls are hideous and malformed creatures, among whom a wide variety of different mutated sub-species and terrible deformities can be found. Perhaps the vilest examples are the Bile Trolls – cursed, tortured creatures with an appalling hunger that can never be satiated. It is said that their bloated and agonised forms endlessly regenerate like many Trolls, only to be digested by their own bilious innards again from within. Corrupt of flesh and dwelling in living agony, they receive no eventual respite from the horror of Father Nurgle’s influence, unlike many of His afflicted children. Furthermore, their stench lingers in the air as suspended droplets of bile that cause weapons to rapidly rust on the spot!	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh3_dlc25_unit_long_text_nur_mon_toad_dragon	Toad Dragons are huge, reeking, primeval horrors. They are, for the fate of the world, blessedly few in number and confined largely to the trackless, otherworldly fens known as the Cold Mires under the coruscating skies of the uttermost north. These colossal beasts are near-mindless, violent and almost impossible to kill, and have a dire reputation in the legends of the Northern Wastes, which name them for their appearance and raw power. In truth they are perhaps far closer to the lumbering beasts that inhabit the jungles of Lustria than the true and ancient lineages of Dragon-kind. 	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh3_dlc26_unit_long_text_grn_art_bolt_throwa	The ability to spear a large monster from a distance or to skewer several man-sized creatures in a single shot appeals greatly to the violent and bloody nature of any Greenskin. The bolt thrower, or Bolt Throwa as it is termed by Orcs and Goblins, is a device commonly found in Greenskin armies. Working along the same lines as a giant crossbow, the device fires a single spear-sized bolt at high velocity. A well-placed shot can bring down a row of oncoming infantry, penetrate the armour of a steel-encased Knight or even slay an Ogre with a single shot – which is no easy feat given their considerable girth!	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh3_dlc26_unit_long_text_grn_cha_gorbad_ironclaw	Gorbad Ironclaw is infamous even among other Orc Warbosses, rising to fame leading his tribe on countless successful Waaaghs! in his time. It was also he who first built Iron Rock, one of the most redoubtable Orc fortresses in the Old World. Conquering Greenskin tribes was never a real challenge for him either – it was his many, many horrific deeds in the Empire that saw him elevated to legendary status among his own kind, the name of Gorbad Ironclaw becoming an inspiration and a byword for "invasions done propa". Gorbad is immensely strong, even for an Orc. Despite his obvious brawn, he is known to win battles by using his head as well, fielding Goblins to effectively attack flanks or screen other troops' movements, and deploying massed archers, war machine batteries and other tactical advancements too. In short, Gorbad Ironclaw always drives whichever ragtag Greenskin host he is commanding, whether Orcs or Goblins they be, to do their utmost in the battle ahead.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh3_dlc26_unit_long_text_grn_cha_snagla_grobspit	Of Snagla's tribe, the Redvenom Forest Goblins, little is known. They were destroyed early on in the battles in the Drakwald, when men from the Empire first cut their frontiers deeper in to the surrounding forest. Snagla -- then one of the rising legends amongst the Forest Goblins along his band of Spider Riders, the Deff Creepers -- found his camp in ruins, and it is rumoured that then the Spider-god spoke to him. Snagla took the fangs from the his tribe's cannonball-blasted Arachnarok Spider, and with them fashioned a throwing spear and a great spiked club. With them, he has been at the forefront of every Greenskin victory, soaking the feathers of his distinct Redvenom garb in the blood of his enemies, and growing his legend.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh3_dlc26_unit_long_text_grn_colossal_squig	The strange, improbable and often quite insane creatures known as Squigs are weird half-fungoid, half-flesh beasts that breed and multiply in symbiosis with the Greenskins. None of these match the sheer size of the Colossal Squig said to inhabit the depths of the Grey Mountains and the Vaults. These spherical monsters are of staggering size and possess insatiable appetites, no more in essence than an impossibly large, fleshy maw studded with row after row of scimitar-bladed teeth.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh3_dlc26_unit_long_text_grn_inf_rugluds_armoured_orcs	Ruglud's Armoured Orcs trace their lineage back to their founder’s strike of genius, never to be repeated, precipitated by a concurrent strike to the head by an oversized piece of masonry, as he was perusing the remains of a battle between Dwarfs and Chaos Dwarfs. Luckily, this happened while he was holding a crossbow and not, say, the bloody remains of a beard. And so Ruglud’s Armoured Orcs were formed, the only known band of Orcs to implement the combination of armour and crossbow. While disliked and distrusted by other Orc tribes, their fighting qualities are grudgingly accepted. Wherever the band travels, it fights for gold and food, and for the chance to strip the enemy of anything worth taking, including any crossbow ammo they can find.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh3_dlc26_unit_long_text_grn_mangler_squig	Other Greenskins claim that living underground has driven Night Goblins mad, and it might be true. One thing is for certain: only the unhinged would try to catch a Great Cave Squig, and only absolute maniacs with little regard for life would dare chain together two Great Cave Squigs and then prod them towards the enemy. The ideal end result, from a Night Goblin's unconventional perspective, is that the Mangler Squigs enrage each other, whirling themselves into a tumbling motion. What follows is a spectacle of severed body parts and founts of gore, to the onlooking Night Goblins' delight.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh3_dlc26_unit_long_text_kho_cha_arbaal	Arbaal is one of the most devoted servants of Khorne, gifted with the power of the dreaded one-handed axe known as the Destroyer in recognition of his staunch devotion. Such a reward is not given to just any Champion, but one that has achieved much greatness and favour under the Blood God’s ever-leering gaze. To such Champions, however, also belongs Khorne's most uncompromising scrutiny. Should Arbaal falter, the magnitude of such a failure would cause him to lose all favour with the Blood God, rendering him as unremarkable amongst other Daemonic aberrations as he was remarkable in triumph, and perhaps worse. Over three thousand years of overwhelming battlefield dominance have made that prospect unthinkable, both for him and his enemies, whose wits literally fail them in searching for a way to bring him down.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh3_dlc26_unit_long_text_kho_cha_bloodspeaker	As Skaramor tribesmen undertake the fated journey from Chaos Warriors to Wrathmongers, the Bloodspeakers chart their path, step by bloody step. The Pilgrimage of Skulls requires singular purpose quite apart from being willing to murder all in your path – though this is undoubtedly a requirement one absolutely cannot skirt, and also includes one’s fellow aspirants. The Bloodspeakers are there to provide and bolster that purpose. But what truly gives them their name and their place of high reverence in their tribe is their ability to call up otherworldly Daemonic horrors within the Brazen Cage’s pool of blood, a challenge that the aspirants must answer in a battle of a different kind.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh3_dlc26_unit_long_text_kho_cha_scyla	Scyla Anfingrimm was once the bane of the coastlands from frozen Norsca to exotic Ind. A bloodthirsty raider and warrior-lord of the Ironpelt tribe, Scyla’s name was synonymous with victory and pillage, and all who met him saw the fire of a born leader in his eyes. By the end of Scyla’s second decade in the service of the Chaos Gods, he had become little more than a mountain of muscle and unquenchable rage, goaded into battle as a beast of war and unleashed to run howling into the ranks of the enemy. After Scyla’s subjugation of the troglodyte Gorgers that dwelt in the Undermountain, Khorne gifted his champion with the mind of a ravenous beast. His body flowed and spasmed out of control until his transformation into the mightiest Chaos Spawn in all the realms was complete.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh3_dlc26_unit_long_text_kho_cha_skarr_bloodwrath	From the moment he was strong enough to heft an axe, Skarr Bloodwrath swiftly garnered a reputation as a bloodthirsty butcher of the worst kind. Though his tribe did not deign to challenge the weak peoples of the south, Skarr found no shortage of foes to battle in Khorne’s honour. Unstoppable though he was, none could fight with such raging abandon without eventually being slain. Yet, his first death – and countless others after that – did not prove to be the end for this Champion of Khorne. Always has the Blood God brought him back to life through the spilled blood of his foes, so that Skarr may continue increasing his tally of skulls in return. Incessant resurrection has taken its toll, however, with the near-immortal warrior losing more of himself with each death, his grasp on reality slipping with each step on the road to Daemonhood.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh3_dlc26_unit_long_text_kho_cha_skulltaker	The Skulltaker is the Blood God’s immortal champion, the greatest of all Khorne’s chosen Bloodletters. When not campaigning with his master’s armies, Skulltaker roams the Realm of Chaos at will atop his mighty Juggernaut, Kuhl’tyran. He appears before fortress and stronghold, drawn by tales of martial prowess and rumour of mighty combatants who might offer some small challenge. When a foe foolish and foolhardy enough emerges, Skulltaker dismounts from his loyal steed, salutes the enemy with upturned blade and charges forward to claim another skull in the Blood God’s name. Once only did he suffer defeat, at the hands of Sigmar. He still bears the scar he earned that day, and takes great pleasure in repaying the debt upon Sigmar’s inheritors at every given opportunity.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh3_dlc26_unit_long_text_kho_inf_khorngors	Bestigors are already some of the toughest of the Children of Chaos, yet even amongst them Khorngors are considered the most dangerous. Khorngors possess the great strength of their Bestigor brethren, but as might be expected from those marked by the God of Battle, they are far more vicious and quarrelsome and less able to restrain themselves from murderous excesses. With red-stained armour echoing the red skin of the Daemons of Khorne, they will eagerly slam into the front line of an enemy where other Bestigors might not hold their nerve. They are undoubtedly some of the most violent figures of all the obscene creatures to be found in any Daemonic horde.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh3_dlc26_unit_long_text_kho_inf_skullreapers	The Northmen tribes of the Skaramor have long maintained an existence of constant battle throughout the Chaos Wastes. That they have rarely crossed the Sea of Chaos is a matter of choice; the Skaramor are devoted to claiming the skulls of the mightiest foes and offering them up to Khorne. The Skullreapers are the warrior-elite of the tribe, a blood-hungry caste even among a people feared for their wanton battle-lust. They are wrath and they are Ruin – howling, blood-mad reavers who fight and kill for the glory of Khorne. Few are they who can stand against them in battle, and countless are the skulls they have laid before the Skull Throne.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh3_dlc26_unit_long_text_kho_inf_wrathmongers	Amongst the Skullreapers of the mortal tribes there are those who stand apart, known by other Khorne-worshipping warriors as the Wrathmongers. They are feared and revered in equal measure, having braved a bloody path that few survive. Beginning their journeys under the tutelage of the Bloodspeakers, they are goaded into fighting amongst each other day and night and feed on the fallen. Finally, they undertake the Pilgrimage of Skulls to reach the Brazen Cage, the sacred Khornate shrine atop a mountain of skulls on the edge of the Realm of Chaos. There they battle Daemons summoned for the final trial, the stakes being the aspirants' own souls. Those who emerge alive are greater than when they entered, for their mortal flesh has been made mighty through battle and infused with the unnatural energies of slain Daemons.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh3_dlc26_unit_long_text_kho_mon_bloodbeast	Of all the cursed of Khorne, these creatures are at once the most twisted and brutal and yet most mysterious, for none can tell their true nature, whether they truly be Daemons or simply twisted, mutated mortals. The Bloodbeasts of Khorne are always masses of muscle and tendon, with pulsing veins and whip-cord sinew. Their every orifice is ringed with sharp teeth that tear into the flesh of those entangled within their elongated limbs. These limbs and tails are often armoured or scaled, while at their ends they transform into the shapes of crude but deadly weapons, flattening into blades and knives or bulging outwards into spiked maces. The Bloodbeasts are always hugely muscled, and are often emblazoned with the skull-mark of their Lord somewhere upon their bodies.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh3_dlc26_unit_long_text_kho_mon_slaughterbrute	A Slaughterbrute is a hulking Chaos beast of muscle and aggression. Those among the forces of Chaos who seek to use such a beast for their own ends soon learn that such a mutant creature cannot be broken by conventional means, and those foolish enough to try are torn apart and eaten for their efforts. Instead, a Slaughterbrute's mind is enslaved, through sorcery, to that of a Chaos Champion. Though some Chaos Champions control a Slaughterbrute through the movement of a marionette, most are able to manipulate the creature through their own surpassing force of will – controlling its every action as if they were their own.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh3_dlc26_unit_long_text_ogr_cha_bragg_the_gutsman	Ogres are a battle-hardened and fearless race, but there walks one amongst their number who is held in dread. Even veterans of a thousand battles feel corpulent shivers at the very name of this killer of killers, this shadowy figure that deals out the most gruesome kind of death imaginable. He is the champion executioner of Ogrekind, a slayer of kings and heroes. To see him on the field of battle is to see death itself at work. He is Bragg the Gutsman and none he has marked for slaughter have ever survived.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh3_dlc26_unit_long_text_ogr_cha_bruiser	Aside from the Tyrant himself, a tribe's Bruisers are the most imposing Ogres in terms of sheer size and strength, and are often related to the kingdom's ruler. Bruisers spend a great deal of their time capitalising on their license to smack seven shades of dung out of any Ogre not toeing the line, not eating messily enough, or spending too much time playing with his Gnoblars. Bruisers are sometimes entrusted with the tribe's standard, a banner so robust it can be used as a weapon. A metal-bound pole smashed through one's head by a Bruiser will be felt no matter what's hanging from it.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh3_dlc26_unit_long_text_ogr_cha_golgfag_maneater	More tales are told about Golgfag Maneater than any other Ogre alive, and Golgfag himself spins a great many of them. Yet there is much truth in the legend, for he has travelled the world far and wide with his cronies, imaginatively titled Golgfag’s Maneaters, with whom he has gained widespread notoriety as a battle-hardened mercenary leader. In truth, Golgfag’s adventures have won and lost him more fortunes than there are Gnoblars in the hills. His title ‘Maneater’ – coined when he once ate his human Paymaster whole and set off with his pay-chests – is a misleading moniker, for he is not picky at all about what he eats. Golgfag’s wanderlust may have prevented him from becoming a great leader up to now, but with enough loot and renown he may yet have his day!	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh3_dlc26_unit_long_text_ogr_cha_paymaster	Next to an Ogre army's cauldron, its paychest is probably amongst the most sacred of its possessions. It is usually entrusted to an Ogre most voluble, though not exactly valuable in terms of fighting skill. Being what they are, in the thick of combat Ogres may at times forget that gold awaits the ones who have distinguished themselves – which is why the Paymaster occupies a prominent place in their ranks and persists in extolling the virtues of the paychest with a single-mindedness that verges on mindlessness, both in and out of battle.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh3_dlc26_unit_long_text_ogr_inf_maneaters	Ogre Maneaters are veterans of many campaigns fought in far-off lands. Travelling mercenaries without peer, they have spent decades accruing scars, tall tales, wealth and exotic wargear before heading back to the Ogre Kingdoms. Maneaters have fought throughout the Old World and beyond, and many races attempt to recruit such fighters into their armies, promising food, gold or whatever else the Ogres want in return for their services. The term ‘Maneater’ was originally coined for the mercenary captain Golgfag Maneater, after he ate his human Paymaster whole, but has become a general term for any Ogre who travels the land as a mercenary.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh3_dlc26_unit_long_text_ogr_inf_pigback_riders	Being as well-travelled as the roaming Maneaters they serve, some Gnoblars have managed to acquire all sorts of clothing, weapons and strange customs on their travels. Among such customs is one of the Gnoblars’ most popular and dangerous sports picked up from Bretonnia, known as "pig jousting". Two Gnoblars sit across from each other on the backs of pigs and charge at each other in an attempt to unseat their opponents. When a Gnoblar horde goes to war, real pigs will not suffice in the intense circumstances of battle, so instead Gnoblars ride atop each other in a "piggy-back" manner using their "pig jousting" tactics to slay (or at least irritate) the enemy.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh3_dlc26_unit_long_text_ogr_mon_blood_vultures	The Blood Vulture is a large, predatory bird that originates high in the Mountains of Mourn, belying its scavenging nature by having no qualms about using its sharp claws and powerful beak against living creatures. Given the gluttonous feeding frenzies in which the Ogres partake when they go to war, it is little wonder that they’ve developed a close relationship with the most vicious battlefield scavengers of the skies. Ogre Hunters in particular like to capture and tame Blood Vultures, using their deadly propensity for aggression to help them hunt down prey or attack their foes in battle.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh3_dlc26_unit_long_text_ogr_mon_thundertusk	Thundertusks are creatures of ice and doom, ancient monsters that strode the darkest ages long ago, when the world was frozen over. As it warmed, they drifted northwards, becoming imbued with the Winds of Magic, and turned into a physical manifestation of winter's chill. Thundertusks advance as relentlessly as a winter storm: a living engine of frozen destruction presaged by eldritch thunderclaps. Fierce predators, these creatures tower above most others in the mountains, although this doesn't stop ambitious Ogre tribes from attempting to capture and tame them. Once tamed, Thundertusks bring to bear their crushing bulk, freezing aura and blasts of magical ice in service of the Ogres.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh3_dlc26_unit_long_text_ogr_mon_yhetees	The Yhetee packs inhabit the highest slopes of many mountain ranges, but are particularly common amongst the Mountains of Mourn and the place of their birth – the peaks of the Ancient Giant Holds. Though their iron-hard claws are the only weapon they require, a vestige of Ogre-like behaviour remains in the Yhetees’ ancestry to ensure that they still use clubs of a sort, an ice-weapon fashioned simply by snapping a bough from a tree and breathing pure cold onto it. It’s not uncommon for an Ogre tribe to include Yhetees amongst its ranks, though how or why the creatures are convinced to fight alongside Ogres is a subject of much speculation. A sense of kinship or a great debt owed from the distant past? Either way, when a Tyrant calls, they answer.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh3_main_cth_inf_grenadiers	Strapped to the teeth with grenades of uniquely formulated gunpowders, the Grenadiers of Nan-Gau shoulder an important (and volatile) responsibility within Grand Cathay’s ranks. Known to the Cathayans as “Thunder-Crash Bombs”, the Grenadiers’ payloads contain various mixtures of powder whose ignition can stun targets and conceal retreats just as well as they can blow enemies apart. The Grenadiers are drilled to know precisely when and where to throw them to allow for various outcomes and battle tactics, but typically will range out ahead of their army’s battle line in skirmish formations, either defending its flanks or baiting the enemy by hurling grenades into their ranks.	false

unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh3_main_ogr_cav_crushers_0	A hard-headed and hyper-aggressive beast of the snow-ridden Mountains of Mourn. Rhinoxen are notoriously short-sighted and rely on their sense of smell to catch wind of predators. They are likely to lower their heads and charge anything they catch a whiff of that doesn't smell like a Rhinox. As the weather atop that icy realm is as likely to be blizzard-like as anything else, such short-sightedness isn't too much of a drawback. Also, their double-horned and stone-hard heads can cause considerable damage. Even a Frost Dragon would move hastily to get out of the way of a stampeding herd of the great shaggy beasts.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh3_main_ogr_cav_crushers_1	Despite the inhospitable weather, the Mountains of Mourn teem with life. Herds of great woolly beasts are plentiful, criss-crossing the boulder-strewn slopes and snowy plateaus seeking food. They are primeval creatures that have existed unchanged since the world was still covered in ice. The Rhinoxen, a common herd animal, will lower their impressively-large horns and charge anything that doesn't stink of their own kind. Their twin horns can gouge a furrow into a cliff face and no predator wishes to be on the receiving end of charge from a single beast, much less a stampeding herd.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh3_main_ogr_cav_mournfang_cavalry_0	Powered by thick haunches of purest muscle, a Mournfang surges towards the foe at a speed faster than their muscle­-bulked frames would suggest, not slowed in the least by the large Ogre or saddle atop its hairy back. Protected by thick skin and coarse shaggy hair, enemy arrows bounce off the oncoming beast or ping off the Ogre's armour, as harmless as hailstones. When they do smash into an enemy, the powerful Mournfangs chomp, slash and stamp the foe whilst the Ogres lay about them, swinging ponderous clubs to bludgeon them.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh3_main_ogr_cav_mournfang_cavalry_1	High up the slopes of the Mountains of Mourn lives a cave­dwelling beast that has always attracted the attention of the Ogres – the Mournfang. Aggressive predators that stalk the icy slopes, they are led by the largest of their kind and, working together, they can hunt and kill anything that lives in that harsh domain. Mournfangs have a notorious tenacity that makes even the most powerful of creatures think twice about confronting them. Ogre tales tell of defiant Mournfangs refusing to give ground and every tribe has a story about a beast continuing to fight long after drawing its last breath.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh3_main_ogr_cav_mournfang_cavalry_2	There is a fortune to be made as a mercenary for a young Ogre with his own Mournfang, and every spring a few stout lads from the upper slopes will join together and sell their services as the heaviest shock cavalry in the known world. Although whole units of Mournfang Cavalry can usually secure the victory of any battle they are engaged in, these brutes and their gigantic steeds do not come cheap. The Tyrants or paymasters of the victorious side often note a profound feeling of loss when the spoils of war are shared out.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh3_main_ogr_inf_gnoblars_0	Gnoblars are wicked creatures possessed of malicious but limited cunning. They are not-too-distant relatives of the Goblins that plague the world and are similar to their Greenskin cousins in height, with most specimens standing little taller than a man's waist. Gnoblars are cruel-minded, and their ability to do harm is only limited by their lack of physical strength. Ogres tolerate the creatures in their camps, especially if they make themselves useful by carrying and fetching things. In battle, a large group of Gnoblars can be, if not exactly formidable, then at least a bit dangerous.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh3_main_ogr_inf_gnoblars_1	These outgoing and vindictive Gnoblars are the largest of their kind, and delight in catching and torturing the small mammals that populate the foothills of the Ogre Kingdoms. Hunting is too sporting for these Gnoblars, who much prefer to trap their prey. To this end, they have perfected the art of laying out jagged man-snappers, pits lined with stakes, wickedly barbed nooses and other cruel devices that will incapacitate the unwary. Once they have snagged something, they like to 'play' with it (usually jabbing it with sharp sticks), before devouring it or bribing their masters with it as a light snack.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh3_main_ogr_inf_ironguts_0	Ironguts are the Ogres of any given tribe that have the most status and the best armour and weapons. They go into battle armed with massive two-handed weapons, be they enormous scimitars, rocks bolted to tree boughs with iron bands, or simply gigantic versions of the traditional Ogre club. lronguts wear large, ornamented gut-plates to show off their elite standing, and cover their meaty arms and boulder-like heads in heavy armour plating cobbled together from various conquests over the years.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh3_main_ogr_inf_leadbelchers_0	It is easy enough to spot Ogres from a Leadbelcher unit, for their faces are scorched, they bear severe powder burns, regularly feature eye patches and often resort to protective metal plates hammered into their faces. This is the legacy of point-blank detonations and an imperfect, if not downright clumsy, understanding of black powder. Regardless, these hardy and noticeably deaf Ogres feel it is well worth sacrificing eyebrows, an eye or even a few fingers for the chance to level their devastating cannons at a foe.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh3_main_ogr_inf_maneaters_0	Maneaters inherit the cultures of the lands they visit, rather than spread their own. These mercenaries learn the fighting skills and adopt the style of dress appropriate to the lands in which they fight. For example, a Maneater in the Empire might wear breeches and an ostentatious feather with a brace of huge pistols across his chest. One who has been campaigning in the jungles of the Southlands, on the other hand, might go into battle as the Savage Orcs do – that is, wearing an undersized loincloth, a gut-plate and nothing else but smeary warpaint.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh3_main_ogr_inf_maneaters_1	Ogre Maneaters are veterans of many campaigns fought in far-off lands. Travelling mercenaries beyond peer, they have spent decades accruing scars, tall tales, wealth and exotic wargear before heading back to the Ogre Kingdoms. Maneaters have fought throughout the Old World and beyond, and many races attempt to recruit such fighters into their armies, promising food, gold or whatever else the Ogres want in return for their services. It is the pay that matters, not the foe, although with some contracts Maneaters are awarded fallen enemies to eat, so in those cases the enemy may matter. Ogres eat anything, but they have preferences.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh3_main_ogr_inf_maneaters_2	When they return to the Ogre Kingdoms, Maneaters take any opportunity to bore their tribe-mates with long fanciful war stories, some of which are even true. Although such tales are tiresome, an Ogre Tyrant is always happy if he can call on the services of one or two units of Maneaters to aid his tribe. They will be used to lead important attacks, or hold a vital part of the battle line. Maneaters are famously stubborn opponents and usually prefer to fight to their last breath rather than flee.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh3_main_ogr_inf_maneaters_3	Maneaters tend to operate in small groups, some of which have fought together for years. Despite their outlandish appearance, these tight-knit bands excel at breaking heads. It's rare for any two Maneaters to fight or be equipped in exactly the same manner, and opponents find themselves facing a dizzying array of different weapons and combat techniques. The only real factors uniting the individualistic Maneaters are an monumentally inflated sense of self-worth and the capacity to smash aside lesser creatures without breaking a sweat.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh3_main_ogr_inf_ogres_0	Big, brutish and extremely violent, Ogres are simple and straightforward creatures; they know what they want and use their brawn to take it. Ogres don't do contemplative head-scratching, preferring to smash things they don't understand. The bull-charge forwards is their favoured way to crush any opposition and greedily grab what they like. And what Ogres want is power, respect, wealth and, perhaps most of all, an endless supply of meat to feast upon.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh3_main_ogr_inf_ogres_1	Ogres excel at fighting and this, along with their greed and lack of concern about right or wrong, means that an Ogre army is always ready for a battle against anyone, anywhere. History is replete with examples of Ogres being paid to fight (and even sometimes being paid not to join a fray). When they do enter combat, Ogres make frightening opponents, for they are savage and can sometimes devour the fallen where they lie. In the heat of battle, this horrifies their opponents, who must fight the blood-splattered vanquisher of their former comrades.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh3_main_ogr_inf_ogres_2	Given the chance, an Ogre will barge into combat, using his great lumbering mass as a weapon. When working together, Ogres can harness the tremendous momentum of their formation to deliver an overpowering impact on anything they collide with. It is a living avalanche, an immense tonnage of muscle and fat behind heavy iron gut-plates that slams the enemy before the individual Ogres themselves begin to lay about with their brutal weaponry. They often cover their off-hand with a spiked metal gauntlet, a habit which originated from the traditional sport of pit-fighting. This gauntlet can be used to bat aside even the strongest attacks.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh3_main_ogr_mon_giant_0	Giants are enormous, lumbering brutes that stride the world seeking battle, food and strong liquors. They are humanoid in appearance, although their features are coarse and misshapen, and they are dull-witted even when compared to an average Ogre. An Ogre Tyrant, if he can restrain himself from attacking a Giant to prove his own superiority, will often try to recruit the solitary wanderer into his tribe. Sharing food or intoxicating drink with the enormous lummox often does the trick, as do promises of an easy life full of eating and drinking.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh3_main_ogr_mon_gorgers_0	Even more ravenous than an Ogre, Gorgers are degenerate eating machines consisting of nothing but taut muscle, claws and ferocity. The beasts are so hungry that they will gobble up anything they can scrounge, even the most tainted of things. To aid a Gorger in its all-consuming quest to feed, he can distend his jaws in the same way as many serpents do in order to swallow larger prey. If that weren't enough, their mouths are crammed full of teeth that grow rapidly through their slimy gums, replacing themselves daily, or sometimes even more quickly.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh3_main_ogr_mon_sabretusk_pack_0	Red in tooth and claw – an apt description for a Sabretusk, as this powerfully-muscled hunting beast is a creature perfectly evolved for slaughter. A lone Sabretusk will bound into the midst of its prey, slashing and stabbing with its elongated tusks, seeking to sever arteries and disembowel its quarry. The snarling assault that follows is a fury of pounces, bites and ripping claws. Should an entire pack of Sabretusks attack at once, then even the largest beasts that haunt the Mountains of Mourn can be quickly brought down in a howling flurry, leaving a red mist hanging in the frosty air.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh3_main_ogr_mon_stonehorn_0	Stonehorns are massive beasts of muscle and violence, each several times the size of a Rhinox and – if it can be believed – several times as dense. Intelligence is of little import to these great beasts however, for each Stonehorn is quite literally a living fossil, its skeleton hardened by the same rock as the mountains where it makes its home. As legendary as their hardiness is their belligerence; in fact it is said that a Stonehorn will take any opportunity to headbutt something to death and trample its corpse into paste.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh3_main_ogr_mon_stonehorn_1	Ogres have the greatest respect for Stonehorns, for the mammoth creatures are everything an Ogre aspires to be: big, violent, strong and rock-hard. They never tire of telling and retelling their favourite accounts of a Stonehorn's prowess or of the gory aftermath they leave after one of their stone-cracking charges. Whether it is the wide trails of Dwarfs flattened and squished out of their armour, the wet crunching sounds a Stonehorn makes when ploughing through Skaven hordes, or fond remembrances of Giants pile-driven deep into the ground, such blood-drenched tales are greedily called for at any raucous Ogre feast.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh3_main_ogr_veh_gnoblar_scraplauncher_0	The Gnoblar Scraplauncher is a large and unconventionally-built catapult pulled along by an enormous woolly beast. Its design is haphazard – the ramshackle construction seemingly built 'on the go' with a random collection of cast off materials. With each stride of its shaggy beast of burden, the jury-rigged device teeters precariously while a frenetic crew of Gnoblars swarm about – running alongside, clambering on its ropes and pulleys like sailors amongst the rigging, or just hanging on for dear life. For all its slovenly appearance, the Gnoblar Scraplauncher is a devastating engine of destruction.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh3_main_ogr_veh_ironblaster	A massive artillery piece even by Ogre standards, Ironblasters are owned only by the most powerful tribes and typically crewed by their largest and richest Leadbelchers. Each Ironblaster was once a giant castle-mounted gun used by the Sky-titans towards the end of their war with the Ogres, pilfered from the ancient mountain rubble and refitted for destruction. When deployed, the great guns are hauled into good shooting positions by grunting and straining Rhinoxes before blasting out fiery tongues of flame and thunderous death, their multiple cannon balls tearing apart entire regiments in volleys of noise and violence.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh3_main_ogr_veh_ironblaster_0	One of the castle-mounted guns the Sky-titans used towards the end of their war against the Ogres. Such is the weight of the vast contraption that the Rhinox which pulls it grunts and strains under the pressure, and even the stone wheels that hold it up can only last for a few battles before cracking under the immense weight. Its multiple cannon balls are able to tear apart a whole regiment in a maelstrom of noise and violence, especially should the lronblaster get in close. 	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh3_main_unit_long_text_cth_art_fire_rain_rocket_battery_0	Rocket launchers are used extensively in the armies of Grand Cathay. Inaccurate but deadly, they hurl explosives long distances, usually in great numbers to saturate an entire area in flame and shrapnel, but are equally able to deliver single massive rockets against monsters or fortifications. The Fire Rain Rocket Battery is a portable war machine, drawn by oxen and crewed by soldiers of Nan-Gau. From its snarling Dragon mouth, it fires either a hail of incendiary rockets to set a section of battlefield alight, or a larger lone explosive able to blast a hole in enemy formations.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh3_main_unit_long_text_cth_art_grand_cannon_0	The armies of Cathay use many kinds of cannon in their armies, most forged in the workshops of Nan-Gau. These include massive Grand Cannons shaped like roaring Dragons, each one able to belch fire or spit flaming cannonballs. The walls of the Great Bastion are lined with such war machines, the fortress towers of the wall looking like war galleons, with sides bristling with row upon row of cannon. When the armies of Grand Cathay march to war, some of these great guns are set upon oxen-hauled gun carriages, where they can lend their impressive firepower to the Dragon Emperor’s soldiers.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh3_main_unit_long_text_cth_cav_jade_lancers_0	The heavy cavalry of Cathay are the Jade Lancers, mounted soldiers of the great cities. The wealthiest cities like Fu-Chow or Wei-jin can afford large contingents of Jade Lancers, though even the remote cities of the south and west can also usually muster at least a unit of these troops. In addition to being a potent tool in the open field, Jade Lancers train to fight in the constricted streets of their cities, and are able to launch devastating charges through narrow alleyways, across bridges and through the tunnels that pierce the city walls.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh3_main_unit_long_text_cth_cav_jade_longma_riders_0	The Celestial Dragon Guard are formidable soldiers, easily the equal to the best mortal troops of other realms. Supplementing their natural skill, they are given the best equipment in the Cathayan empire – often carrying Celestial blades and armour forged in the workshops of Kunlan. Their presence on the battlefield almost guarantees victory for the Cathayans, and other troops in the army draw courage from the sight of the Dragon Emperor’s personal troops. Almost without exception, the Longma cavalry of the Celestial Host consist of the Dragon-blooded. Swifter than normal horses and able to spear their foes on their horns, Great Longma are the ultimate shock horse soldiers anywhere in the world.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh3_main_unit_long_text_cth_cav_peasant_horsemen_0	The armies of Grand Cathay are vast, and if there is one thing the Dragon Emperor does not want for, it is men and women to fill their ranks. Horsemen are a common sight in the provinces, the horse being as prolific a beast of burden and transport as it is in the Old World. Cathayan generals use these highly-mobile troops primarily as scouts, though they can also be used to lure away enemy troops or draw them into ambushes.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh3_main_unit_long_text_cth_cav_peasant_horsemen_1	Horsemen are common to the provincial armies, the horse being as prolific a beast of burden and transport as it is in the Old World. Cathayan generals use these highly-mobile troops primarily as scouts, though they can also be used to lure away enemy troops or draw them into ambushes – the riders themselves often trained in the use of horse bows, allowing them to pepper their foes with arrows as they stay frustratingly out of reach.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh3_main_unit_long_text_cth_cha_alchemist	Outcast elemental Wizards often gravitate toward Shang-Yang and the west. Here they have formed their own shadow Celestial Court known as the House of Secrets. In the House of Secrets, all kinds of magic is practised, though the Alchemists of Shang-Yang are especially well known for using the rare elements of the Warpstone Desert to create powerful elixirs, metals and potions. Favoured by the Iron Dragon, the Alchemists have steadily gained power and acceptance over the centuries, and generals and magistrates will sometimes secure their services in battle, where their sorcery can enchant soldiers' weapons.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh3_main_unit_long_text_cth_cha_astromancer	Of all the magical disciplines, the most well-established is that of the Astromancers. These are the favoured Wizards of the Celestial Emperor, and who practice Heavens Magic. Unlike the Magisters of the Celestial Order in the Empire of the Old World, Astromancers have been perfecting their art for over five thousand years. The Celestial Dragon himself is said to have taught man the true secrets of Azyr, and their spells are far more complex and powerful as a result.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh3_main_unit_long_text_cth_cha_dragon_blooded_shugengan_lord_yang	Over the centuries, the Celestial Dragon’s nine Dragon children have themselves had children, born of mortal men and women. These mortal offspring of the Dragons are known as the Dragon-blooded. In time, these mortal children have themselves become the progenitors of entire dynasties, their people able to trace their ancestry back to the Celestial Dragon himself. While the Dragon-blooded remain relatively rare, there are still many thousands of them in Cathay. Given their lineage and the power that comes with it, the Dragon-blooded typically rise to positions of authority, as important rulers or magistrates in the lands controlled by their forefathers and mothers.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh3_main_unit_long_text_cth_cha_dragon_blooded_shugengan_lord_yin	The Dragon-blooded are natural Sorcerers, and many take to mastery of the Elemental Winds as easily as wielding a blade or crossbow. The most powerful of them are known as the Shugengan, an elite arm of the Celestial Court that stands equal to, but apart from, the Astromancers. The Shugengan practise their own form of High Magic – focused on the Yang or Yin branches of the elemental winds – known as Feng Shi, and can conjure the most powerful magics known to the empire. Only the Dragons themselves are able to command the Elemental Winds more skilfully.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh3_main_unit_long_text_cth_cha_iron_dragon_0	A hardened frontier warrior, the Iron Dragon maintains the western edge of the empire and keeps the desert clans in order. A skilled alchemist, he uses the strange minerals of the Warpstone Desert to create unique weapons for his armies. Cabals of Metal and Fire Wizards are welcomed within his realm, much to the irritation of the Jade Dragon who sees the encouragement of sorcerous organisations outside of the Celestial Court as dangerous to the empire. These Sorcerers help the Iron Dragon in his experiments, and many magical weapons and armours are therefore forged in the Dragon’s cities.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh3_main_unit_long_text_cth_cha_iron_dragon_1	The other Dragons have in the past questioned the sanity of their brother, fearing that his proximity to the Great Maw might have somehow poisoned his mind. While there is no solid evidence of this, the Iron Dragon is prone to strange moods and unpredictability – though nothing to date has ever threatened the empire. Certainly, the Celestial Dragon has never questioned the devotion of his son or his right to rule the western part of the empire. Zhao Ming may appear in either as a man or in Dragon-form depending on his desire, and may even transform during the course of a battle. 	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh3_main_unit_long_text_cth_cha_lord_magistrate	Each of the great cities of Grand Cathay is governed by a Lord Magistrate in the name of the Dragon Emperor. These are canny men and women, as adept at navigating the politics of the empire as they are directing troops in battle. As skilled strategists, Lord Magistrates can often dictate the pace of battle even before it begins; catching their enemies flatfooted with the rapid mobilisation of their troops. Lord Magistrates lead from the back of the army, using fans, banners and coloured smoke to orchestrate many units of their army.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh3_main_unit_long_text_cth_cha_storm_dragon_0	The Storm Dragon rules over Northern Cathay and commands the armies of the Great Bastion. Cold and aloof, she has held this position for centuries, after its defence was entrusted to her by the Celestial Dragon. Despite her power, the Storm Dragon has a significant task in the defence of the north, and her armies are almost constantly at war. Her vaulted position also means her father entrusts her with important tasks, some of which can put her at odds with her siblings.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh3_main_unit_long_text_cth_cha_storm_dragon_1	Miao Ying is one of the most powerful of the Dragon Emperor’s children, and surrounded by an aura of majesty difficult for even great heroes to resist. Largely considered the favourite of their father by the other Dragons, the Storm Dragon lords over her siblings and when they meet often stands apart from them. Miao Ying may appear in either as a woman or in Dragon-form depending on her desire, and may even transform during the course of a battle. 	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh3_main_unit_long_text_cth_inf_ancestral_warriors_0	The Celestial Dragon Empire is thousands of years old and in that time countless generations of soldiers have died in the defence of Grand Cathay. On rare occasions, through arcane means, their spirits may be recalled from the underworld to serve the Empire again, even for the briefest of moments. These warriors will travel back through the waters of the Dragon River, to the east of the Great Bastion, before being made manifest back on mortal soil. The warrior-spirits do this gladly, such is the desire to serve the Moon Empress and her regent.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh3_main_unit_long_text_cth_inf_crane_gunners_0	Firearms are primarily constructed in Nan-Gau by edict of the Dragon Emperor. The foundries of the City of Smoke turn out large numbers of these weapons, in all shapes and sizes. One of the most common variants is the Crane Gun, a long-barrelled firearm often carried by two Nan-Gau soldiers and fixed to a tower shield for greater accuracy. Used in large numbers, these guns can scythe down enemy formations at great distances, or pick off enemy leaders and monsters with precise volleys of fire.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh3_main_unit_long_text_cth_inf_dragon_guard_0	The Celestial Dragon Guard are formidable soldiers, easily the equal to the best mortal troops of other realms.

unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh3_main_unit_long_text_cth_inf_dragon_guard_crossbowmen_0	The Celestial Dragon Guard are the personal bodyguard of the Dragon Emperor and Empress, and form the Celestial Host – the greatest soldiers in all Cathay. As the most elite warriors in the empire, they enjoy the finest weapons and armour and are almost always led by a member of the Dragon-blooded. The Dragon Crossbows of the Celestial High Guard are the work of Grand Cathay’s master weaponsmiths. They are massive repeating weapons, able to lay down a steady stream of heavy bolts.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh3_main_unit_long_text_cth_inf_iron_hail_gunners_0	The Iron Hail Gun is a heavy blunderbuss with a large bore for close in work. Though short ranged, it is ideally suited to defence, either in the close confines of a city or from the battlements of the Great Bastion. Cathayan commanders often deploy their Iron Hail Gunners on the flanks of their formations where they can discourage even heavily-armoured horsemen, the concentrated shot from their Iron Hail Guns able to punch through shields and plate at close range.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh3_main_unit_long_text_cth_inf_jade_warrior_crossbowmen_0	Despite its understanding of technologies such as gunpowder, alchemy and machinery, Cathay does not rely upon them in battle in the way the Empire and the Dwarfs do. Rather, their technological advances are merely another tool in their vast arsenal, and one that cannot be replaced (in the eyes of the Celestial Dragon at least) by the strength of conventional soldiers. Soldiers in the Cathayan armies fight in ordered ranks, each one trained to move in harmony with those around it, the entire army often fighting like a single organism under the direction of its generals.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh3_main_unit_long_text_cth_inf_jade_warrior_crossbowmen_1	Armed with polearms, crossbows and equipped with heavy armour and shields, Jade Warriors are the bastion upon which the enemy breaks, be they defending their city’s walls or the centre of the Cathayan battle line. Cathayan soldiers make use of great, lacquered tower shields, either carried by gun teams or worn on the backs of warriors, so they might turn around and go down on one knee, creating a formidable defensive line.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh3_main_unit_long_text_cth_inf_jade_warriors_0	Each city in Cathay maintains its own standing army. These troops are well equipped, by the wealth of their city, with the finest weapons and armour. They carry banners bearing the symbols of their city, as well as the Dragon to which their city owes allegiance, all under the icon of the Celestial Dragon who rules all Cathay. Given their place within the defence of the empire, they are known as Jade Warriors, a stone sacred to the Dragon Emperor, and one that represents the implacable nature of his realm.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh3_main_unit_long_text_cth_inf_jade_warriors_1	Grand Cathay is a land in harmony with the world around it, with every soldier knowing their place in the grand designs of the Celestial Dragon Emperor. Known as the Harmony of Stone and Steel, this perfect alignment of purpose and will expresses itself in the discipline of the armies of the Dragons. Armed with polearms, crossbows and equipped with heavy armour and shields, Jade Warriors are the bastion upon which the enemy breaks, be they defending their city’s walls or at the very centre of the Cathayan battle line.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh3_main_unit_long_text_cth_inf_peasant_archers_0	In Grand Cathay, archery, and the use of missile weapons, is traditionally the domain of women. Though men can, and do, make up some of the empire’s missile troops – most notably those who wield the gunpowder weapons of the Great Bastion – the majority of archers and crossbow troops are female. This is the work of the Moon Dragon Quai Yin, herself an exceptional archer, who has for centuries encouraged girls across Cathay to master the art of bow and crossbow, as well as blessing their efforts with her magic.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh3_main_unit_long_text_cth_inf_peasant_spearmen_0	Cathay has thousands of villages, towns and other settlements outside of its grand cities. Each province is expected to raise an army from these villages should the Dragon Emperor call upon them. These provincial troops are not as well equipped as the professional armies of the empire, favouring simple weapons like spears and bows, but they are far more numerous and no less well organised in battle – the will of the Dragons making them fight harder than men and women merely sworn to mortal lords.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh3_main_unit_long_text_cth_inf_peasant_spearmen_1	The armies of Grand Cathay are vast, and if there is one thing the Dragon Emperor does not want for, it is men and women to fill their ranks. Despite their discipline, professional soldiers like the Jade Warriors of the great cities do not flinch when a peasant formation breaks – for such is the purposes of such units, to slow the enemy until they can be dealt with by more skilled fighters. Cathayan infantry often use long spears in dense infantry formations, allowing them to impale charging enemies on a forest of blades.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh3_main_unit_long_text_cth_mon_terracotta_sentinel_0	Terracotta Sentinels are creations born of the Dragon’s mastery of the Elemental Winds, each one a towering animated statue fashioned in the form of a great warrior. Legend has it that these Sentinels are the gigantic soldiers of an army built by the Dragon Emperor thousands of years ago, when Chaos threatened to overwhelm the empire. Since then, they have been left scattered across Cathay, waiting to be called to war once more. Once given orders, a Terracotta Sentinel will not falter in its duty, relentless carrying out its last commands until the task is complete.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh3_main_unit_long_text_cth_mon_vermillion_warbirds_0	The Vermillion Warbirds of the Mountains of Heaven are magical phoenix, each one the size of a large warhorse. These great birds live atop the highest peaks, but can be coaxed down to fight for the Celestial armies by skilled Wizards. In battle they fight in flocks, sometimes consisting of dozens of warbirds, the air around them set alight by the creature’s flaming bodies.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh3_main_unit_long_text_cth_peasants	Cathay has thousands of villages and towns outside its grand cities, each expected to raise a militia should the Dragon Emperor call. With their simple spears and bows, these provincial troops are not as well equipped as the professional armies of the empire, but are far more numerous and no less organised. The will of the Dragon makes the lowliest subject of Grand Cathay fight harder than those sworn to mere mortal Lords, while the Jade Warriors and other professional soldiers never flinch when a peasant formation breaks. Invariably, peasants fulfil their purpose, slowing enemies down until they can be dealt with by superior fighters.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh3_main_unit_long_text_cth_veh_sky_junk_0	An invention of Shi-Hong – Nan-Gau’s Master War-Artificer – the Sky-Junk is a wonder of the Celestial army. As large as a ship of the Jade Fleet, it is suspended in the air by a series of Sky Lanterns, its armoured cradle able to turn aside arrows and bullets as its crew rain death down upon the enemies of the empire. These great vessels can be seen defending the borders of Grand Cathay, but are also used beyond the Great Bastion, where armadas of the Dragon Emperor’s sky ships have lain waste to entire marauder tribes.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh3_main_unit_long_text_cth_veh_sky_lantern_0	Sky Lanterns are used by the Dragon Emperor’s armies to observe enemies from on high, as well as direct troops in battle. Held aloft by a caged Vermillion Warbird – the creature's burning wings giving the great balloon lift – a Sky Lantern holds an armoured gondolier beneath its bulk. From this gondolier one of the Lord Magistrate’s best strategists uses fans and banners to signal troops, or direct the fire of the army’s war machines. Should enemy flyers or missile troops get too close, a pair of Crane Gunners snipe from their exceptional vantage point.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh3_main_unit_long_text_cth_veh_war_compass_0	A Wu Xing Compass is a smaller version of the great Compass of Wei-jin. Crafted to resonate with the Elemental Winds, it helps the Wizards of Grand Cathay control and direct the Winds of Magic, strengthening or weakening them for the benefit of their armies. Mounted on a specially-designed chariot-platform, the Compass is drawn into battle alongside the Celestial Dragon’s armies, a Court Scribe of the Celestial Court tending to its intricate mechanisms. Properly manipulated, the Wu Xing Compass can unleash the Elemental Wind of Azyr, assailing the enemies of Cathay with lightning bolts, storm winds or even a devastating rain of meteors.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh3_main_unit_long_text_dae_cha_be_lakor_0	Be'lakor the Dark Master is the first Daemon Prince of Chaos. The First Damned, the Harbinger, the Lord of Torment, the Messenger of the Great Undivided, the One Who Heralds the Conquerors, the Foretoken and the Bearer are just some of the names by which he is known. At the dawn of the World, Be'lakor became the first mortal to pledge his soul to the Chaos Gods. A fierce warrior and stalwart Champion of Darkness, the Ruinous Powers favoured him and lured him north to the Chaos Wastes where, having penetrated deeper and deeper into this bleak land, he entered the maddening Realm itself. The Dark Gods rewarded his courage by destroying his mortal shell and recreating him in their image: that of a Daemon Prince. In this new form, Be’lakor truly is a terrible force. Now, his unquenchable ire has been turned upon the very Gods who gave him power. As Ursun, the Bear-God of the Kislevites, lays dying, Be'lakor intends to take his place and ascend to Godhood himself – as the fifth Ruinous Power!	false

They know that there is a great prize for those who show unflinching devotion. Should a champion survive the endless battles and the ravaging mutations granted by their masters whilst still finding favour in the eyes of his fickle gods, he may attain the ultimate reward. The patron of the champion will elevate him to his side as a Daemon Prince, a being of godlike power, forever bound to darkness.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh3_main_unit_long_text_dae_cha_daemon_prince_MP	No one knows Arcalux's true mortal origins. Some say he was a stranger from the east, imprisoned by the Dawi-Zharr. During his enslavement, he brokered a pact with the Chaos Gods and was freed by a flock of Daemonic Furies, last see being carried off into the north. On his return to the battlefields he was changed. Though the Dark Gods had not yet seen fit to claim his soul, the Chaos Furies still flocked to him.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh3_main_unit_long_text_dae_cha_daemon_prince_kho_MP	In his former life, Ulgor was a pit fighter whose patron was a Border Prince. After killing all who faced him in the pit, Ulgor was due a large reward of gold and 'freedom' from his owner. As the noble climbed into the pit to deliver this prize, Ulgor heard Khorne whisper, promising endless slaughter and the reward of Daemonhood if he simply killed this popinjay... and we all know whose reward he chose...	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh3_main_unit_long_text_dae_cha_daemon_prince_nur_MP	The mortal name of this Daemonic Prince has been lost to time, but since his ascension to Daemonhood, Grand Vomitus has been very active in spreading the Urfather's love. It was he who brought the infamous Canker Blight to the citizens of Artois and delivered the Vrux Beard Lice to Karak Azul; a tough Daemon and a spellcaster also.	false

unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh3_main_unit_long_text_kho_cav_bloodcrushers_0	The most favoured of all Bloodletters are granted the honour of becoming Bloodcrushers. Bloodcrushers are Khorne's shock cavalry, a deadly combination of battle­ frenzied Bloodletter and the unstoppable crushing mass of a Juggernaut of Khorne. When the Daemonic legions go to war, bellowing hordes of Bloodcrushers stampede across the battlefield, trampling Khorne's foes into unrecognisable pulp. When battle begins, Bloodcrushers relentlessly hurl themselves at the strongest point of an enemy's lines. Here they hack, maim and gore their way through the strongest troops the foe can muster, exulting Khorne's name with savage joy for each enemy slain.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh3_main_unit_long_text_kho_cav_skullcrushers_0	So favoured in the eyes of Khorne are these murderous Knights that the Blood God has gifted them with Juggernauts to carry them to war. These massive Daemonic mounts are made of living metal and pure rage; they are dealers of untold destruction who grind their foes beneath steel sinews and brass hooves. As the blood-crazed Knights bellow their battle cries, their fearsome mounts snort steam and paw out divots the size of shallow graves before stampeding towards the ranks of their prey and flattening anything in their way. 	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh3_main_unit_long_text_kho_cha_bloodreaper_0	Each Bloodreaper carries a Hellblade, a jagged iron sword whose blackened blade glows with heinous enchantment. A wound from one of these weapons can slay even the hardiest hero, draining their soul and sucking dry their shrivelled corpse. The Hellblade is formed from the Bloodreaper's own essence and can never be discarded nor torn from its grasp. Each life taken by it strengthens the Bloodreaper, fuelling both its power and rage. As such, a Bloodreaper is even more terrifying at a battle's close than its start, having gorged itself on the slaughter it has caused.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh3_main_unit_long_text_kho_cha_bloodreaper_1	A deadly combination of battle­frenzied Bloodreaper and the unstoppable crushing mass of a Juggernaut of Khorne. The hide of a Jugger is composed of rivetted and fused metal plating, decorated with icons of Khorne and stained with the dried lifeblood of its mortal victims. A Jugger is a beast of primordial rage; fire pulses through its body in place of blood, its iron-shod feet throw sparks with each step and its brass snout spills choking black steam into the air with every breath.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh3_main_unit_long_text_kho_cha_bloodreaper_2	The Blood Throne is a mark of status – a physical manifestation of the Blood God's favour. The Bloodreaper that resides atop its pinnacle does not rest or repose as would another in its position, but prowls restlessly as the chariot advances, eyes and tongue twitching madly in anticipation of the next kill. No bastion of command is this, as it perhaps would be in a mortal army – the Bloodreaper certainly does not attempt to direct the massed regiments of Bloodletters that fight in its shadow. Once the battle begins, raging bloodlust reduces Bloodletters and Bloodreapers alike to maddened beasts.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh3_main_unit_long_text_kho_cha_cultist_0	The Cults of Khorne can be found across the world. Less fond of the clandestine trappings that accompany the other Dark Powers, His Cultists establish and propagate such sects, roaming far and wide to serve their God, spreading His corruption in their stead. Some will aspire to rise and become true champions of Khorne, but there are always plenty of eager supplicants who simply wish to murder and slay in the Blood God’s name, and so spread their Cult's influence far and wide.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh3_main_unit_long_text_kho_cha_cultist_1	A warhorse is a sign of status, and only the best warriors may ride them. The steeds ridden by these tribes are powerful beasts, foul-tempered and strong of limb. Once a rider has broken such a horse, it will remain loyal to him until death, but remain vicious and unruly should a stranger approach. Fed on a diet of human flesh and watered-down blood, these snorting, high-spirited steeds have a glint of intelligent menace in their eyes, and will trample, kick and bite as if berserk when engaged at close quarters.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh3_main_unit_long_text_kho_cha_exalted_bloodthirster_0	Exalted Bloodthirsters are not only the most deadly of Khorne's Daemons, but the mightiest of all Daemonkind. A single such beast is a harbinger of bellowing death, destructive beyond telling, and lives only to slaughter, maim and destroy all that it encounters. It is the fury of war given form, the unfettered primal rage of the world made manifest. And such should be expected of a beast whose master is the Dark God of Bloodletting, Slaughter and Murder.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh3_main_unit_long_text_kho_cha_herald_of_khorne_0	Most feared of all amongst the Bloodletters are the dread Heralds of Khorne.

As a Herald's rage grows, all nearby Daemons of Khorne become gripped by an irresistible madness that lends further fury to the carnage. They hack and cleave their foes until there is nothing left save a mound of corpses and another victory for the Blood God.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh3_main_unit_long_text_kho_cha_herald_of_khorne_1	Juggernauts, or Juggers, are massive armoured creatures that are part-Daemon and part-ensorcelled steel and sinew. They are mighty beasts of groaning iron and brass, taller than a man and possessed of crushing mass. Occasionally, a particularly-favoured Herald of Khorne is granted a Juggernaut to better pursue his master's goals. Such a pairing is far deadlier than the sum of its parts. Should a foe survive the frenzied biting and goring, they are likely to be crushed beneath its brass body, or cut down by the Jugger's rider.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh3_main_unit_long_text_kho_cha_herald_of_khorne_2	A mighty Daemon Engine, armoured in brass and driven into battle by iron-shod wheels which crush and mangle all who stand in its path. From atop his macabre throne, the Herald searches for foes whose skulls will make the most audacious offerings. Those plundered from cowards are fed into the Blood Throne's baleful workings, consumed in fire to bring the Daemon Engine fresh vigour. Those taken from the valiant slain are claimed by the Herald and fused with the throne itself, to stand throughout eternity as grim monument to the futility of opposing Khorne.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh3_main_unit_long_text_kho_cha_skarbrand_0	The Bloodthirster Skarbrand was once the greatest of all Khorne's Daemons. No other had piled so many skulls before the Skull Throne. One dark day, Skarbrand's fierce pride grew hot and, blinded by rage, he smote the Blood God a mighty blow. Incandescent with wrath, Khorne cursed Skarbrand's name and choked all personality from him, leaving only the bottomless rage that had caused him to attack. Since that fateful day, Skarbrand has wandered the mortal and immortal realms, drowning his sins in the blood of the slain – though he no longer has the wit to fully understand why.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh3_main_unit_long_text_kho_inf_bloodletters_0	The Daemon hordes of Khorne consist of ferocious Bloodletters, deadly warriors believed to have been foremost amongst the Blood God's followers in mortal life and whose will is as implacable and blood-hungry as Khorne himself. When loosed to the fray, Bloodletters sprint from one enemy to the next, hacking the foe apart before springing away in search of new victims. With each fresh kill, the Bloodletters loose great shouts of victory that echo across the battlefield and chill the souls of all who hear.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh3_main_unit_long_text_kho_inf_bloodletters_1	Khorne’s Chosen – the Naked Slayers, the Takers of Skulls, deadly warriors believed to have been foremost amongst the Blood God's followers in mortal life and whose will is as implacable and blood-hungry as Khorne himself. Exalted Bloodletters gather in regiments, chanting their brutal praises to Khorne. In the fashion of the warriors they are believed to have once been, each unit marches beneath a gore-soaked banner upon which the names of their victims are inscribed.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh3_main_unit_long_text_kho_inf_chaos_furies_0	Furies are yowling shards of malevolent energy – Chaos in its purest form. With little in the way of intelligence, they are utterly subservient to the whims of the Dark Gods, and shift in aspect and power as the balance of the dark pantheon alters. They are easily subjugated by other Daemons, whom they regard with a mix of dread and awe. Furies swarm at the edges of the battle, avoiding the thickest fighting if they can. Only when they sight a vulnerable victim do they descend, a wailing mass from which there can  be no escape. 	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh3_main_unit_long_text_kho_inf_chaos_warhounds_0	In Norsca, wolves and hounds prowl in the flickering shadows of the campfires made by the barbarian tribespeople of the frozen lands. The further north the tribe dwells, the more likely it is that the hounds that follow them will be mutants, their bodies swollen by the energies of Chaos. Brutish and bloodthirsty, the Warhounds of Chaos are natural killers built of muscle and fang that lurk in the wilderness in ravening packs. They will even charge a spearwall with total abandon, their only concern the moment when their slobbering jaws sink into juicy, yielding flesh.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh3_main_unit_long_text_kho_inf_chaos_warriors_0	A Chaos Warrior of Khorne has no need of food, drink or sleep, for he is nourished by the carnage that he wreaks. He has nothing but contempt for the weak or the cowardly and goes about the business of murder with a vengeance, for there is always a part of the man who was that rages against that which he has become. A Chaos Warrior's only solace is in slaughter – the fulfilment of his new existence as an instrument of his blasphemous God's will, and at battle's end, his armour is spattered with the lifeblood of the slain.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh3_main_unit_long_text_kho_inf_chaos_warriors_1	Chaos Warriors of Khorne are fighters of unmatched prowess. Their strength is infernal and their bodies are as tough as the Iron Mountains. Imbued with the power of the Blood God and encased in suits of hell-forged armour, a Chaos Warrior is equal to several battle-hardened mortal men. They are no longer truly human, but living weapons, honed perfectly for the bloody tasks before them.	false

unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh3_main_unit_long_text_kho_inf_flesh_hounds_of_khorne_0	Flesh Hounds are Khorne's foremost tool of vengeance. When a being – mortal or Daemon – rouses the Blood God's ire, he rises from the Skull Throne and sounds a single sonorous note on a great brass horn. This blast echoes through the mortal and Daemonic realms alike as a peal of portentous thunder, rousing Flesh Hounds from their slumber and loosing them upon the hunt. Few can survive gory pursuit by these relentless carnivores, for Flesh Hounds are faultless and instinctive trackers, able to harry their quarry across fen, forest and stone without once losing the scent.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh3_main_unit_long_text_kho_mon_bloodthirster_0	Those few who have confronted a Bloodthirster and survived commonly recall an overwhelming impression of vast size and unchecked barbarity, of roaring and snarling death riding upon stygian wings that eclipse the sun. A Bloodthirster's ruddy skin is covered with coarse fur and brass armour, slick and gleaming with the blood of innumerable victims. This armour is forged upon the Daemon's flesh by Khorne himself and thereafter becomes a living part of the Daemon, even whilst maintaining a brutal intelligence of its own. As such, even the Bloodthirster's armour is wrathful and longs for slaughter.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh3_main_unit_long_text_kho_mon_khornataurs_0	To the Khornataurs, a battlefield is a place of maddening excess. The scent of gore in their flaring nostrils drives them wild and they bellow their hunger for all to hear. They charge with a thundering impact, horns lowered to impale, then strike blow after blow against their hapless enemy. Once their victims have been hacked apart, the Khornataurs slake their thirst by tearing at raw flesh with their gore-encrusted nails and gulping down great hunks of steaming meat even whilst the battle rages on around them.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh3_main_unit_long_text_kho_mon_khornataurs_1	When called to war, the Khornataurs reach into the piles of weapons and armour heaped in offering before the herdstones, equipping themselves with the largest and most formidable weapons they can find. These weapons were laid before the herdstones in celebration of victory, their erstwhile owners slain upon some forgotten battlefield. In amongst the rusted blades can sometimes be found those once carried by the warriors of long-lost empires, crafted using methods and metals no longer known to any of the peoples of the world, fragments of tarnished armour that might have been made for the guards of long-dead, forgotten kings. 	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh3_main_unit_long_text_kho_mon_soul_grinder_0	When a Daemon's physical body is slain, he can surrender his true name to the Forge of Souls. The dark bargain thus sealed, his crippled essence is bound to a mighty Warp-metal hulk. Thus is he reborn as a Soul Grinder. A Soul Grinder's clanking tread shakes the ground with every step, and it is devilishly fast for a creature its size, able to scuttle swift as a horse's gallop, or even faster should the scent of battle touch its nostrils. Piston-driven legs thud home with sickening force, crushing to bloody paste those beneath.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh3_main_unit_long_text_kho_mon_spawn_of_khorne_0	A grisly death is not the worst fate that one who has trod the path of Khorne can suffer, for the Blood God is inhuman and whimsical, and he makes no distinction between a beneficial or disadvantageous gift. Even the most vaunted Chaos Lord can find himself disfigured in an instant, his body wracked by a multitude of debilitating mutations. Should Khorne continue to pile on his dubious gifts, the recipient will devolve into a mindless, hideous creature known as a Chaos Spawn.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh3_main_unit_long_text_kho_veh_blood_shrine_0	Mounted upon a carnage-fuelled Daemon engine, the Blood Shrine judders, spins and zooms across battlefields at great speeds, desperate to be smothered in gore and so draw the gaze of its mighty patron – the Blood God and his most powerful servants. The Blood Shrine is a mobile altar that will empower Kharneth’s Daemons to greater heights of butchery and wanton slaughter.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh3_main_unit_long_text_kho_veh_skullcannon_0	As the Skull Cannon grinds across the battlefield, its spiked wheels and rollers mangle everything in its path. Those who somehow survive the initial onset of the grinders are fed screaming into the Skull Cannon's gaping maw, there to be roasted by Daemonic fire and ground to fragments. Only the skulls – so beloved of Khorne – are retained, and fed into the mighty cannon atop the machinery from which the Daemon Engine takes its name. They slam into the enemy ranks, scattering foes like ninepins and leaving a trail of scorched and blazing dead behind.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh3_main_unit_long_text_ksl_cav_gryphon_legion_0	The Gryphon Legion are a standing force of highly-experienced Winged Lancers, notable for their improved wargear, as well as their prodigious skill at arms. The first loyalty of these warriors is to the throne of Kislev – they place their duty to the queen above all other obligations. They often serve as a mercenary army for allied powers, at times when Kislev is not currently fighting a war. This gives them a wealth of experience fighting different foes, and ensures that their warriors can never grow lax or allow their skills to dull from lack of use.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh3_main_unit_long_text_ksl_cav_horse_archers_0	Horse Archers are often the only elements of a Kislevite army the foe encounters. They patrol the oblast constantly, ensuring roads are clear of bandits and roving enemies, and watching constantly for incursions from the north and east. Bands of Horse Archers are welcome wherever they go, for all know that they will fight ceaselessly to protect any Kislevite settlement from invaders. That said, being a Horse Archer is not necessarily a lofty calling – respected but not greatly envied, except by those who long for the freedom of the open plains and cold nights beneath starry skies.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh3_main_unit_long_text_ksl_cav_kossovite_dervishes_0	Much of Kislev is known as the oblast, a huge, open wilderness. It is said that one’s horse is one’s life when on the oblast – this is not a joke or an old wives’ tale, but rather the cold, hard truth. If a Kislevite rider is freezing, they warm their steed first. If they are thirsty, it drinks before them. Why? Because without a horse, if the hunters of the Dark Gods don't catch them, the Motherland's wintery embrace will make an orphan of their children just as readily.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh3_main_unit_long_text_ksl_cav_war_bear_riders_1	Just as the people of Kislev worship Ursun, Bear-God of the Motherland, so too do they respect his kin which dwell in the wild lands and forests. These are no slave beasts to be whipped or abused – their riders honour them, and they return this honour. Only in this way can man and bear join their might to drive the hated slaves of Chaos howling back into the oblast. 	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh3_main_unit_long_text_ksl_cav_winged_lancers_0	Every settlement large enough will support a rota of Kislevite Winged Lancers, a cavalry squadron of hardy, well-trained warriors who form the offensive heart of almost every Kislev army. They are also a potent psychological weapon, for at full gallop they cause the very air to shudder and roar. Becoming a Kislev Winged Lancer takes dedication and effort... and a great deal of money to afford the thoroughbred steed, mail coat, breastplate and helm. Only skilled warriors are accepted into their ranks, for a stanitsa can ill-afford to equip layabouts, cowards or dolts in such a manner.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh3_main_unit_long_text_ksl_cha_ataman	Most oblast communities are led by a ruling class of hands-on administrators drawn from Kislevite nobility, known as Atamans. In some cases, their families may have ruled an area for generations, but more commonly an experienced Ataman will be assigned a post where they are most needed to bear a community’s greatest responsibilities. All manner of local matters are decided by an incumbent Ataman, such as those pertaining to security, spiritual matters or law. More importantly, when a settlement of Kislev comes under threat, it is the local Ataman’s duty to protect his community by taking up arms and marshalling his garrison at a moment’s notice.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh3_main_unit_long_text_ksl_cha_boris	Kislev’s history is blighted by many awful leaders throughout its past – and Tzar Boris is certainly not amongst them. A formidable figure in every regard, he is famed as an implacable warlord and a cultural reformer. His faith in the gods of Kislev, and the revival of the Cult of Ursun, has made him popular with the pious, while his militaristic nature gives him significant sway with the soldiery. Though the Great War of Chaos was outside of living memory, its scars remained visible, and Boris has long laboured to ready his beloved Motherland against the rising threat.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh3_main_unit_long_text_ksl_cha_boyar	Ranking nobles, Boyars are powerful men and women within Kislev. They each govern specific areas of Kislev, including scores if not hundreds of stanitsas, as well as larger towns and small cities. Especially large cities are governed by Boyars of singular prestige. This is a hereditary rank, although royal edict can raise one to the position. On the battlefield, they are tough and doughty fighters – the best in Kislev, save for the Tzar and the Golden Knight.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh3_main_unit_long_text_ksl_cha_frost_maiden_ice	When the Tzarina’s personal attention is not required, it falls to the women of the Ice Court to represent her might instead. Since the time of the Khan Queens there has been an Ice Court, a powerful political body devoted to preparing the noble daughters of Kislev to take on positions of power. It is from this body that the Frost Maidens – Ice Witches yet to complete their training – are drawn. Akin to an academy, the Ice Court schools the young women within its halls in matters of diplomacy, intrigue and sorcery.	false

Instead, its sorcery is derived from within the Ice Court, and invariably reflects the brutal winters of Kislev. It is from this body that the Ice Witches are drawn. Their Ice Magic is the raw, murderous power of cold, harnessed as a weapon – from frozen ground that binds the foe's feet to lances of icy death. While all magic is drawn from the raging Winds, there is no doubt that Ice Magic is strongest when used within the borders of Kislev itself.	false

unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh3_main_unit_long_text_ksl_cha_katarin	Ascending to the throne and crown in the wake of her father's bloody death fighting against the hordes of Chaos, Katarin has wasted no time cementing her grip upon Kislev. She is, in every way, a totalitarian ruler. She is stern and unflinching and will readily have rivals removed by agents of the crown if she cannot win them over with cold reason. The base of Katarin's power, beyond hereditary right, is her extraordinary magical prowess. She is the greatest Ice Witch for generations, capable of magical feats more deadly and devastating than any other Ice Witch in Kislev.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh3_main_unit_long_text_ksl_cha_kostaltyn	Ursun is not a vicious god (although he is both brutal and merciless in times of war). To his followers, he is fatherly and large. Kostaltyn is the Supreme Patriarch of the Ursunite faith, and he is as unlike his god as it is possible to be. With wild hair, wild eyes and wither-thin limbs, Kostaltyn is a ghoulish figure, robed in the finery of the resurgent Ursunite faith. He is a howling, angry firebrand, screaming furious rhetoric at the enemy and urging the warriors around him to fight on with a fearful mixture of encouragement and threat.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh3_main_unit_long_text_ksl_cha_patriarch	The sentinels of the Kislevite faith. Bombastic, loud and proud of their creed, they exhort the warriors around them to acts of courage, protecting them with the power of faith. Patriarchs stride into battle bellowing the folk-songs of the Kislevite people with the cadence of battle-hymns – and mighty miracles of war are wrought by their belief. Bones of long-dead Kislevite heroes are carried in reliquary boxes, and those nearby take heart... although whether they hold any true magical properties remains a topic of speculation.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh3_main_unit_long_text_ksl_inf_armoured_kossars_0	Armoured Kossars are full-time soldiers, either paid by the crown or simply supported by their wealthy families. As such, their time is spent entirely either training or carousing. They are dour, grim-faced killers on the battlefield, but after the battle is done, they are the most belligerent, boisterous and hard-drinking of all the celebrants at a victory feast. They wear heavy armour above the waist, and sturdy reinforced boots, though their legs are clad only in baggy trousers. This is a weakness in protracted combat, but it helps them resist undue fatigue – and keep pace on a long march.	false

As such, their time is spent entirely between training and carousing. They are dour, grim-faced killers on the battlefield, but after the battle is done, they are the most belligerent, boisterous and hard-drinking of all the celebrants at a victory feast. Arrogance, reinforced by undeniable results – these are warriors as good as an ordinary man can hope to become.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh3_main_unit_long_text_ksl_inf_ice_guard_0	In Kislev, the voice of a woman is equal to that of a man, and the worth of a ruler is judged by the wisdom of their rule and their might in battle. Perhaps that, more than any other reason, gave rise to the unusual sisterhood known as the Ice Guard. These are the warrior elite of the Ice court, a bodyguard for the Ice Witches, and who are imbued with the same magical power as their mistresses. They are fearsome and fearless, conditioned to put Kislev first and to face the vilest horrors of the Old World without hesitation.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh3_main_unit_long_text_ksl_inf_ice_guard_1	The Ice Guard is staffed by formidable warrior women, sent to the Bokha Palace before they reach adolescence. These youths are then sorted for their aptitude for magic. Those with the gift begin a training regimen that will enable them to take their place within the Ice Court, a clandestine place of intrigue and power, typically headed by the senior matriarch of the Kislevite royal family. Each weapon these women wields is imbued with ice magic, glowing with its own inner light.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh3_main_unit_long_text_ksl_inf_kossars_0	Kossars are the mainstay of the Kislevite armies, regiments of grizzled and hardened fighters, drawn primarily from among the many thousands of foresters and trappers who keep Kislev's stanitsas and cities fed. They fight with bows and axes, the two traditional weapons of the Kossars – symbolising the woodsman and the hunter. This ornate wargear is wrought to last a lifetime if well-cared for. Many is the wizened old Kislevite who has handed their axe down to their grandchild, telling tall tales of the countless Marauders or Chaos beasts it has slain.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh3_main_unit_long_text_ksl_inf_kossars_1	While Kossars fight in regiments, they are not necessarily the most disciplined warriors, at least on the face of it. These hard-living hunters and trappers, drawn from the layfolk of Kislev, are fatalistic about the bitterness of warfare, drinking together by the fire at night and singing raucous anthems as they march, joking constantly at one another’s expense. They wear light armour, if any at all. This grants them great freedom of movement and enables their already impressive stamina to shine through.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh3_main_unit_long_text_ksl_inf_streltsi_0	The Streltsi were originally armed with bardiches and handguns, in order that they could rest their firearm upon the crook of their polearm and thereby achieve greater accuracy. However, in an effort to get 'one more' shot off before the enemy closed upon them, the warriors would often run out of time to effectively stow their gun and ready their bardiche. Instead, the heavy gun was often simply reversed and used as a bludgeon. Eventually, Streltsi captains took the radical step of embracing this alternative approach, and had their rotas’ rifles modified to include axeblades on the gun stock.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh3_main_unit_long_text_ksl_inf_tzar_guard_0	Regiments of hardened warriors, formed of lesser nobles and veteran soldiers elevated to higher status from the ranks of the Kossars, the Tzar Guard are formidable, durable melee troops. Originally, they were instituted to serve as the Tzar’s personal retinue, and while he would invariably travel with a large warband of Tzar Guard at his back, almost every army of Kislev now boasts a regiment or two of these hardened warriors. This is because every Boyar and Marshal needs a steady core to their army – veteran warriors able to act as the bulwark of the Kislevite battle line.	false

unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh3_main_unit_long_text_ksl_mon_elemental_bear_0	Some say that Kislev is alive, a Motherland which cares for its people and defends them in times of war. Outsiders call these claims old wives’ tales – but those who have seen the land literally rise up and fight know better. Elemental Bears are creatures of magical wrath, brought into sentience by the faith and devotion of the Kislevite people, and imbued with the spirit of the land. Massive, terrifying and crackling with magical energy, they are a brutal force of nature rising from the earth to fight beside Kislev's children.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh3_main_unit_long_text_ksl_mon_snow_leopard_0	With the Tzarina at the head of the Ice Court, storms of death await for invading armies, and the beasts of Kislev stalk the forests and oblast, seeking out her foes. One such creature is the Great Sabre-toothed Snow Leopard, a fierce battle-cat that can be trained to protect the women of the Ice Court. Snow Leopards’ natural prey are wandering herbivores, but in times of famine they have been known to consume Chaos beasts, taking savage delight in chomping down a Troll or Minotaur when the need arises.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh3_main_unit_long_text_ksl_veh_heavy_war_sled_0	The heavier War Sleds of Kislev are the Motherland’s answer to the Empire’s War Wagons. They are beautifully carved from timbers harvested from the great forests, and reinforced with metal scales to protect their occupants. A combination of mancatchers, poleaxes, glaives and spears grant them deadly impact in melee combat, while handguns ensure that they can pack a punch at range. These War Sleds also carry an abundance of extra shot for prolonged campaigns.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh3_main_unit_long_text_ksl_veh_light_war_sled_0	In times of winter, the armies of Kislev must still range far and wide across brutal, snow-blasted terrain. For this reason, the Kislevite armies are often supported by War Sleds. Loaded with supplies, especially black powder and shot, they trail behind rotas of Winged Lancers or regiments of Kossar warriors. War Sleds are crewed by sturdy veterans who can be trusted to stand their ground, drawn from the ranks of the Streltsi and Kossars alike.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh3_main_unit_long_text_ksl_veh_little_grom_0	Kislev is not known for massed artillery. In fact, at many points throughout its history, the Boyars and Druzhina have been expressly forbidden from maintaining their own. In the reign of Tzar Alexis a dozen new cannons were commissioned, under the orders that "their roar would drown out the hordes of Chaos like the thunder of gods". The Thunderers, as they were known, made a great difference in the battles that eventually saw the legions of Chaos thrown back into the northern wastes. By the time the fighting was over, most of the twelve Thunderers were lost... but a precious few remain.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh3_main_unit_long_text_monster_feral_bears	A common sight throughout the forests of the Old World, the hardy Bear is an intimidating beast. Common to the Empire, revered by the Kislevites, but often feared by both, Bears are not a natural threat to wayward men – preferring a diet of berries and fish. But the wilds of the Old World are as unforgiving as its cities, and in times of devastation a hungry Bear may set its appetite on lost travellers or stray patrols.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh3_main_unit_long_text_monster_feral_ice_bears	From head to haunch, the Ice Bear is a lumbering mass of muscle.

Frequent manhunters, stories of Kislevite forager parties going missing at the borders of an Ice Bear's range surface all too frequently.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh3_main_unit_long_text_nur_cav_plague_drones_0	High-ranking Plaguebearers are known amongst the Daemon legions as Plague Drones; a title that conveys commendable humility, yet belies the power beneath. These stewards of Nurgle's garden ride into the mortal realm mounted upon Rot Flies – colossal Daemon-insects whose appearance is so repugnant it leaves festering scars upon the mind. From their lofty positions the Plague Drones can properly tally the diseases running rife across the battlefield, as well as swiftly intervene should Nurgle's divine plans meet with heavily-armed resistance.	false

When facing the unremarkable warriors of the mortal realm, a Rot Fly will slowly digest all meat from a skull before spitting out a plague-infused death's head that its Plaguebearer rider can hurl at the foe. Given the chance, though, Rot Flies will hunt down the impertinent mortals that slew their previous incarnations. Opening their maws wider than physical law should allow, they consume their persecutors whole.	false

These Pox Riders, as they are known, often take the vanguard of a Plaguedaemon battle line, crashing into the ranks of mortal foes like bloated cannonballs, their riders' tainted blades slashing about them, necrotic filth and brackish blood spraying up from them as they fall, heedless of their losses. 	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh3_main_unit_long_text_nur_cha_cultist	The fell Gods of Chaos ask for total and complete devotion from their mortal followers, and they grow strong upon the conflict and slaughter they unleash.

A cloud of flies accompanies its bearers, making them difficult to target.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh3_main_unit_long_text_nur_cha_exalted_great_unclean_one	In perverse contrast to his horrific appearance, the Exalted Great Unclean One is neither morbid nor consumed with despair – if anything the opposite is true. Exalted Great Unclean Ones are exuberant in the pursuit of their enthusiasms. Gregarious and curiously sentimental, Exalted Great Unclean Ones hold their followers dear and even refer to them as their 'children'. They take great patriarchal pride in the achievements of their fellow creatures, proclaiming vociferously the splendours of the poxes and sores evinced by those around them, and bellow with hearty laughter in response to the destruction wrought in Nurgle's name.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh3_main_unit_long_text_nur_cha_herald_of_nurgle	The longer a victim can endure against Nurgle's Rot, the greater in the Plaguelord's sight the resulting Daemon shall be. From the souls of such hardy individuals are shaped the repulsive Heralds of Nurgle, who march in the Daemonic legions as proof positive that even the strongest and ablest cannot indefinitely defy disease. Heralds of Nurgle possess a strength and hardiness that belies their rotten frames, as well as a jovial nature somewhat at odds with the world-weary aspect of their droning minions.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh3_main_unit_long_text_nur_cha_ku_gath_plaguefather_0	Whilst other Great Unclean Ones work to spread the plagues already extant, Ku'gath, the Plaguefather, is fascinated by the breeding of new and virulent life. Ku'gath aims to one day breed a contagion that can infect the Gods themselves. The Plaguefather rides upon a massive palanquin bedecked with alchemical paraphernalia: vials full of seething powder, flasks of indescribable liquid and hessian sacks stuffed to bursting with Nurglings. This great bulk is held aloft by a carpet of straining Nurglings, and Ku'gath is attended on by countless others, all bred from the Plaguefather's pox vats. 	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh3_main_unit_long_text_nur_cha_plagueridden	Though they share many loathsome features, Plaguebearers are by no means identical in appearance and ability, for Nurgle's Rot is somewhat variable in its virulence and incubation. The longer a victim can endure against Nurgle's Rot, the greater in the Plaguelord's sight the resulting Daemon shall be. From the souls of such hardy individuals are shaped the repulsive Plagueridden, who march in the Daemonic legions as proof positive that even the strongest and ablest cannot indefinitely defy disease. 	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh3_main_unit_long_text_nur_inf_chaos_furies_0	Furies are yowling shards of malevolent energy – Chaos in its purest form. With little in the way of intelligence, they are utterly subservient to the whims of the Dark Gods, and shift in aspect and power as the balance of the dark pantheon alters. They are easily subjugated by other Daemons, whom they regard with a mix of dread and awe. Furies swarm at the edges of the battle, avoiding the thickest fighting if they can. Only when they sight a vulnerable victim do they descend, a wailing mass from which there can  be no escape. 	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh3_main_unit_long_text_nur_inf_forsaken_0	Forsaken are frothing maniacs that howl and scream as they sprint pell-mell towards the enemy lines, mutated limbs flailing and distended jaws snapping like those of ravenous beasts. Though they were once proud and mighty Chaos Warriors, because of the severe mutations bestowed upon them, they have become something less than human, with no more understanding of battlefield tactics than the hounds that gather around their bone-strewn lairs. These unfortunates have been reduced to the level of animals, and snarl and growl in a guttural parody of true language.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh3_main_unit_long_text_nur_inf_nurglings_0	The rotting bowels of the Great Unclean Ones swell with pus and contagion, and within each swelling there grows a tiny and malevolent Daemon called a Nurgling. Physically, they are miniature versions of Nurgle himself, with friendly mischievous faces, tiny, bloated green bodies, and limbs that are often distorted or disproportionate. When faced with an enemy they advance in a furious swarm, clawing and gnawing at the foe's legs, biting his ankles and licking at any interesting sores or abrasions they discover.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh3_main_unit_long_text_nur_inf_plaguebearers_0	The rank and file of Nurgle's legions, crafted from the soul-stuff of mortals who have been slain by Nurgle's Rot. What little of the Plaguebearer's skin that can be seen beneath the discharge of innumerable sores is tinged with suppurant greens and vile browns. Pus weeps continuously from its single bloodshot eye and from the Daemon's forehead protrudes a single horn – the mark of Nurgle's Rot. Units of Plaguebearers are surrounded by a constant drone, created by the attendant hosts of plump black flies, and by the endless counting as the Daemons attempt to calculate their master's ever-changing requirements. 	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh3_main_unit_long_text_nur_inf_plaguebearers_1	It is the Plaguebearer's eternal role to herd Nurgle's Daemonic forces in battle, as well as keep stock of the diseases, allocate appropriate fates to each new victim, and attempt to maintain order amongst a naturally chaotic horde. These onerous duties have earned Plaguebearers the title of Nurgle's Tallymen in popular lore. It is all but impossible to tally anything amid the chaos of battle, though this in no way discourages the Plaguebearers from their efforts. They are the embodiment of the need of mortal creatures to impose meaning upon an uncaring void.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh3_main_unit_long_text_nur_mon_beast_of_nurgle_0	The Beast of Nurgle is a truly horrendous aberration, no less deadly than it is morbidly and irrefutably ugly. Its corpulent form is both sticky and slimy, as a layer of infectious ooze seeps from its every pore and orifice. Despite its fearsome appearance and deadly attributes, the Beast is an affectionate creature that behaves in all respects exactly like an over­friendly and easily excited puppy. It craves attention, greeting newcomers by slobbering all over them and petting them with its slimy tentacles. Once the Beast's new friend stops moving, its interest quickly shifts to another target.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh3_main_unit_long_text_nur_mon_great_unclean_one_0	A gigantic figure bloated with decay, disease and all imaginable kinds of physical corruption, the Daemon's skin is a necrose and leathery surface covered with pockmarks, sores and other signs of loathsome infestation. His inner organs, rank with decay, spill through the ruptured skin and hang like rotting drapes about an immense girth. From these organs burst tiny pustulant creatures called Nurglings, which chew and suck upon the nauseous juices within. Such foulness echoes the fundamental truth of the universe: whilst there is life, there will be ruin and decay, even unto the end of all things.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh3_main_unit_long_text_nur_mon_plague_toads_0	The blackest, filth-choked lagoons and lightless sumps of the Plaguefather's realm have served as a spawning ground to all manner of daemonic beasts and foul creatures. They are toad-like bags of brackish filth and pus whose wide maws can swallow a man whole. As well as being dragged along like pestilent flies in the wake of Chaos summonings and Daemonic incursions, these maligned Daemons are drawn to places of disease and decay in the mortal world such as the dank reaches of sewer-pits and stagnant mires, devouring the unwary that cross their path and finding sustenance in suffering and befoulment. 	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh3_main_unit_long_text_nur_mon_rot_flies_0	Beasts of Nurgle, perpetually disappointed by the rag-doll inactivity of their mortal playthings, develop a kernel of bitterness in their ebullient souls. Crestfallen puzzlement leads to frustration and ultimately an aching resentment of the mortals that spurn its company. Over the millennia, a thin seed of malice grows in such a Beast's heart, feeding upon depression and angst until it throbs like a canker at the Daemon's core. Eventually the creature within bursts out of its fleshy sac as a full-grown Rot Fly, a creature of pitiless malice hell-bent on wreaking its revenge upon an uncaring universe.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh3_main_unit_long_text_nur_mon_soul_grinder_0	When a Daemon's physical body is slain, he can surrender his true name to the Forge of Souls. The dark bargain thus sealed, his crippled essence is bound to a mighty Warp-metal hulk. Thus is he reborn as a Soul Grinder. A Soul Grinder's clanking tread shakes the ground with every step, and it is devilishly fast for a creature its size, able to scuttle swift as a horse's gallop, or even faster should the scent of battle touch its nostrils. Piston-driven legs thud home with sickening force, crushing to bloody paste those beneath.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh3_main_unit_long_text_nur_mon_spawn_of_nurgle_0	Should Nurgle continue to pile on his dubious gifts, the recipient will devolve into a mindless, hideous creature known as a Chaos Spawn. Though the Plague God may turn his champion into a spawn if they have displeased him in some way, he is just as likely to do so simply as a result of inadvertently heaping one mutation upon another. Though their forms are repulsive, these gibbering once-men are revered by the followers of Chaos, for they believe that it is better to know the briefest and most vile of existences at the behest of the Ruinous Powers than to grow old without drawing their notice.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh3_main_unit_long_text_ogr_cha_butcher_beasts_0	Butchers are typically more rotund than an average Ogre and have even worse personal hygiene. They often resemble walking larders, for in addition to being caked in dried blood and offal, they adorn themselves in chunks of meat, along with an array of meat hooks, cleavers, filleting knives and even special tenderisers tucked into a leather apron or even pierced through their flabby skin. A Butcher must be prepared to use these items in their gore-soaked rituals at a moment's notice. Of all true Ogres, only the Butchers do not wear a gut-plate – they trust their guts to the protection of the Great Maw.	false

unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh3_main_unit_long_text_ogr_cha_firebelly_0	Firebellies are the roaring, blazing priests of the Ogre deity known as the Fire Mouth. Quick to mirth and anger alike, Firebellies are garrulous and vital individuals who are readily welcomed into any Ogre tribe. Fire burns within these larger-than-life prophets in a literal as well as metaphorical sense. Bald and broad, their ruddy skin glows from within, and their bare chests are tattooed extensively with symbols of destruction. When a Firebelly's wrath is roused, he can breathe out a cloud of billowing flame so fierce that it can melt through chainmail in seconds.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh3_main_unit_long_text_ogr_cha_greasus_goldtooth_0	Tradelord Greasus Tribestealer Drakecrush Gatecrasher Hoardmaster Goldtooth the Shockingly Obese was one of many whelps sired by the infamous Gofg, Tyrant of the Goldtooth tribe. Like his brothers, Greasus grew up to become strong and fat. Unlike his brothers, he killed and ate his own father. As word spread of such prodigious deeds, many Tyrants decided to join the ruthless new leader of the Goldtooth tribe and soon, once again, the Ogre Kingdoms had an Overtyrant. These days, grown older, larger, louder and richer than ever, Goldtooth's coffers fill faster than his Gnoblars can count. Yet Greasus' rampant success has not diminished his greed, or his all-consuming desire to conquer everything he sees.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh3_main_unit_long_text_ogr_cha_hunter_0	Ogre Hunters are solitary wanderers, outsiders from their own tribe or perhaps even exiles. Those that survive become fiercely independent warriors and savvy stalkers of beasts. Bereft of a tribe's protection and beefy companionship, lone Hunters must learn to track and kill, while simultaneously not becoming prey to any ferocious beasts – it is all too common for the Hunter to become the hunted. Although most no longer belong to a tribe, Hunters periodically drag an impressive kill back to an Ogre camp for a special feast day. Some return to the tribe of their origins, while others wander throughout the kingdoms.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh3_main_unit_long_text_ogr_cha_hunter_1	An Ogre Hunter who has tamed a Stonehorn is a celebrated individual. Stonehorns are oblivious to the most grievous wounds and the only proven way to break one is to take one of its eyes, which is no mean feat given the beast's stone­armoured skull. After a time, the wound heals, often the eye even grows back, but by then the Stonehorn has been persuaded to allow a rider. A Hunter might keep such a beast as his own mount or, if he wishes to boost his reputation, he could gift the beast to a tribe, for Stonehorns are much-coveted by all right-thinking Ogres.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh3_main_unit_long_text_ogr_cha_skrag_the_slaughterer_0	Skrag is the legendary Prophet of the Great Maw, also known as the Gore-Harvester and the Maw-that-Walks. Dragging his massive meat-pot behind him – attached to his back with a series of painful, tearing hooks and chains – Skrag hacks and rips at his enemies in a glorious blood-fuelled dedication to the Great Maw. In his wake, he leaves a trail of dismembered limbs and body parts, which it is the duty of his Gore-Gnoblars to retrieve and deposit into his cauldron.	false

In battle, however, Butchers are most often found right in the thick of the fighting, where they use their cleavers and magic to great effect. The largest, most fearsome and most powerful Butchers are given the additional title of Slaughtermaster, and there are few things that walk or crawl that such expert killers have not chopped up and prepared for a ritual feast.	false

unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh3_main_unit_long_text_ogr_cha_tyrant_0	Ogres call the leaders of their tribes Tyrants and it is easy to see why. Tyrants are the biggest and strongest individuals in a hulking race that prides itself on these physical features. To claim rulership over a group of Ogres requires a mighty brawler, a creature powerful enough to wrestle a Giant to the ground or smash his way through a fortified gate using only his bare fists. An Ogre Tyrant uses his tremendous size and brawn to dominate, earning the right to command the tribe by displaying prodigious feats of what the Ogres respect the most – strength, violence, extraordinary girth and a healthy, all-consuming appetite.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh3_main_unit_long_text_sla_cav_heartseekers_of_slaanesh_0	Heartseekers are playfully cruel. They delight in running a luckless mortal ragged, pursuing him across leagues and leagues of rugged and broken countryside. Then, when all seems lost, they break off their chase, allowing the prey to regather his failing strength and rekindle a waning hope of escape. Such hunts can continue for months or even years, with the Heartseekers goading the mortal to the very edge of mental and physical endurance. Only when his mind collapses and he willingly succumbs to their embrace do the Seekers end the hunt and drag his soul back to the Realm of Chaos.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh3_main_unit_long_text_sla_cav_hellstriders_0	Slaanesh finds the desperation of mortals exhilarating, especially in those who possess neither the strength nor the cunning to succeed. To these weak-willed men, Slaanesh whispers a dark bargain – power, but at a price. The Dark Prince sends a Steed of Slaanesh to these mortals, offering the creature as a gift to carry him from one glorious victory to the next. In exchange, Slaanesh asks only that his enemies' souls are sacrificed to him. However, once they sit astride the Daemonic steed, they will never again dismount. Though they do not yet realise it, they have just become Slaanesh's willing slaves.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh3_main_unit_long_text_sla_cav_hellstriders_1	Hellstriders are devotees of torment who hunt from the back of impossibly swift Daemonic steeds. They fight to inflict pain and despair, landing mortal blows upon their victims where they are most likely to prolong the agonising moment of death. Some Hellstriders fight with blades that long ago mutated into their own flesh, whilst others carry a mass of writhing lashes that move with an intelligence of their own. These barbed whips strike out with incredible speed, splitting skin, ripping out throats and flensing flesh in the blink of an eye.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh3_main_unit_long_text_sla_cav_seekers_of_slaanesh_0	Seekers of Slaanesh are the Prince of Chaos' outriders, darkling Daemonettes mounted on swift daemonic Steeds. Malign of intent and with the predatory swiftness of a striking cobra, Seekers dart across the endless battlefields of the Realm of Chaos, springing ambushes on vulnerable prey. These Daemonic huntresses are swift beyond belief. Some legends say that the Seekers can charm time itself and so travel between the seconds. Other tales claim that their steeds are formed from the guilty desires of all living creatures and so can never be outrun, for who can flee beyond the reach of his yearnings?	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh3_main_unit_long_text_sla_cha_alluress_0	Alluresses surge across the battlefield on lithe legs, the whorls of pigment from their gaudy tattoos forming dizzying fractals of colour and shape. When a battle is done, Alluresses stride amongst the fallen and bring their souls to Slaanesh's palace in the Realm of Chaos, where those who made pacts with the Dark Prince and fought well in battle are anointed as Daemon Princes. Those who foreswore Slaanesh or proved craven upon the field are damned to dwell in the otherwordly Palace of Pleasure for an eternity of torment. 	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh3_main_unit_long_text_sla_cha_alluress_1	Steeds of Slaanesh are curious bipeds. They have long, sinuous bodies that writhe ceaselessly as they speed towards the foe on delicate, bird-like feet. Steeds vary enormously in colour, and run the entire gamut of pigment from pastel yellows and oranges through to moody blues and sultry ochres. A long, whip-like tongue flicks constantly from the Steed's toothless mouth, coiling and ensnaring its rider's opponent. Should the victim survive the attack, his waking life will forever be plagued by alluring hallucinations, and his dreams haunted by temptations of the darkest kind.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh3_main_unit_long_text_sla_cha_alluress_2	Seeker Chariots are not subtle creations. As the straining steeds urge the chariot to full speed, swirling shapes sear the air with unholy hues and the metal axles screech in a disharmony akin to the wailing of tormented souls. Indeed, to stand against such a machinery is not simply a contest of arms, but a struggle of wills that shakes the boundaries of sanity. When the chariot finally crashes home, the Alluress dances from yoke to spar, laughing as their disembowelling strikes weave bloody trails in the air.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh3_main_unit_long_text_sla_cha_alluress_3	Alluresses of Slaanesh often elect to ride into battle atop an Exalted Chariot. From here, the Alluress can reach down to whisk victims from the chariot's razored maw. Such is not an act of kindness. Indeed, enemies claimed in this manner soon start screaming to be returned to the embrace of the merciless blades below, if it means they will remain not a moment longer in the grasp of the doting Alluress's cruel affections.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh3_main_unit_long_text_sla_cha_cultist_0	Cults of Slaanesh are secretive covens hidden away in the higher echelons of society. They spread rapidly, as wanton lust always does. Drawn to them are the pleasure-seekers and the depraved, but not all cults are built on lechery. The Dark Prince is also a patron of the arts, and so his followers can be found in artist communes or with those that have a need to hone in on perfection, wherever they might be.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh3_main_unit_long_text_sla_cha_exalted_keeper_of_secrets_0	Formed of the stuff of Chaos and gifted with the subtle and insidious magic of the Dark Prince, an Exalted Keeper of Secrets is an accomplished spellcaster, wracking the enemy with spasms of agony, clouding their minds with dark whispers of glory and creating insidious illusions of their worst fears and greatest desires. Many heroes have been unable to resist their own primal urges and desires while the Greater Daemon of Slaanesh toys with them before they are dismembered with exhilarating delicacy and precision.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh3_main_unit_long_text_sla_cha_herald_of_slaanesh_0	Heralds of Slaanesh not only attend to Slaanesh's whimsical desires, but muster his armies, plot his campaigns (Slaanesh is easily bored by the minutiae of war) and carry his creed to the mortal realm, returning to bring morsels of courtly intrigue to the Dark God's ears. At other times, the Heralds carry their master's word to specific followers singled out for divine notice. Not all such visitations are welcomed by those who receive them, for Slaanesh is nothing if not effusive in his tempers, but the coming of Herald of Slaanesh has nevertheless become an omen of great import.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh3_main_unit_long_text_sla_cha_herald_of_slaanesh_1	The Steeds of Slaanesh can taste the Winds of Magic and seek out the spirits of mortals just as a natural creature senses odours on a drifting breeze. Each soul has a unique flavour and, after but a single taste, the Steed can follow that one specific being throughout eternity if it wishes. Such hunts can continue for months or even years, with the Herald goading the mortal to the very edge of mental and physical endurance. With his surrender, the mortal robs the Herald of their entertainment, but damns himself to an eternity of exquisite torment in the Palace of Pleasure's loathsome chambers.	false

unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh3_main_unit_long_text_sla_cha_nkari	N’Kari is a ruiner of purity, a despoiler of the faithful and a harbinger of damnation. To him, fear and lust are the most succulent of dishes, but any mortal rapture provides sustenance – particularly if the victim can be propelled from the heights of one to the depths of another. Nothing is more delectable to N’Kari than the act of snatching a prideful popinjay from the adulation of his followers, drowning him in stark terror, then returning him, broken-minded and wallowing in his own involuntary filth, to the mockery of the comrades who once roared his praises.	false

They are shrouded in a hypnotic glamour, seditious magics that bestow their repulsive features with perverse beauty. None can say what unearthly delights a Daemonette is believed to pleasure the soul with, but upon the reeking field of battle, pain is the gift they bring. Daemonettes surge across the battlefield on lithe legs, the whorls of pigment from their gaudy tattoos forming dizzying fractals of colour and shape. Capering troupes of the perverse creatures dance from foe to foe, claw-hands slicing through flesh and armour to bestow a savage and sensation-filled death.	false

unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh3_main_unit_long_text_sla_inf_marauders_0	Chaos Marauders are natural fighters, born into hardship and brought up in a world where surviving each day is no small victory. Only the strong and capable prosper, for the weak are weeded out and killed. They have no time for plough or sickle, for their tools are the axe, the sword and the shield. What their own lands cannot provide, they simply take from the lands of lesser men. Those who bear the Mark of Slaanesh have experienced sensations beyond comprehension, and are now insensible to mere mortal fears.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh3_main_unit_long_text_sla_inf_marauders_1	Comparing the men of the north to those who dwell in the temperate south is to compare a wolf to a sheep. Where the southerners cower behind the high walls of their cities, the warriors of the north roam the far corners of the world in search of adventure and plunder. Where the soft-bellied denizens of the Empire glut themselves on fine wine and cheese in front of the fireplace, the hardened Northmen rip into raw meat with their bare hands and teeth. Small wonder then, that Marauder attacks are feared across the Old World.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh3_main_unit_long_text_sla_inf_marauders_2	The tribes of Northmen which flock southwards with any Chaos invasion are known by those in their path as Chaos Marauders. These savage barbarians fight with cruelly barbed flails, and charge in great howling mobs towards the foe. They have little fear of dying in battle, for they know that they fight under the scrutiny of their Dark Gods, and that cowards are beneath their deities' notice. These battle-hardened killers are the products of a people so steeped in conflict that, even in times of prosperity, they will fight to the death for the honour of leading the next raid.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh3_main_unit_long_text_sla_mon_fiends_of_slaanesh_0	Fiends are incredibly swift, able to skitter and scuttle across all manner of terrain at frightening speed. There is something unnameably disturbing about a Fiend's gait, for its twitching dance rocks it from side to side. In this way, they take at least three or four steps for every pace they advance, splayed legs beating out an arrhythmic toccata which praises the glory of the Dark Prince of Chaos. The Fiends sing to one another as they run, emanating a high-pitched and pervasive chitter that few mortals consciously hear.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh3_main_unit_long_text_sla_mon_keeper_of_secrets_0	A Keeper of Secrets is a terrifying foe to face, delighting in exquisite pain, the caress of claw through skin and muscle, bone and organ. Its enormous razor-edged claws can tear apart a heavily-armoured Knight with one graceful slash while its hands can crush bone with horrifying ease. Its actions are a ballet of exquisitely performed blows. Every strike by claw or blade is bestowed with almost delicate precision; a sensuous caress becomes a rib-crushing embrace, and a casual swipe becomes a drawn-out gouge which spills organs and blood upon the ground in all manner of pleasing patterns.	false

As the straining steeds urge the chariot to full speed, swirling shapes sear the air with unholy hues and the metal axles screech in a disharmony akin to the wailing of tormented souls. Indeed, to stand against such a machinery is not simply a contest of arms, but a struggle of wills that shakes the boundaries of sanity. When the chariot finally crashes home, the Daemonettes dance from yoke to spar, laughing as their disembowelling strikes weave bloody trails in the air.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh3_main_unit_long_text_sla_veh_hellflayer_0	The Dark Prince of Chaos prides himself on the splendour of his decadent realm. Alas, the constant warfare and anarchy that so defines the Realm of Chaos has ever worked against Slaanesh's pursuit of perfection by leaving battle-slain corpses littered across his lands like the petals of a particularly repulsive plant. Thus do the Hellflayers ride hither and yon across the alabaster plains, their reaping blades cutting and slicing the distaff flesh into small pieces that Slaanesh's otherworldly flora can easily devour.	false

unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh3_main_unit_long_text_tze_cav_chaos_knights_0	Knights of Tzeentch are feared throughout the Old World and beyond as merciless butchers capable of turning the course of battle with a single charge. They are towering brutes atop immensely powerful Chaos Steeds, rider and mount clad in thickest plate, each section of armour crafted by a master Daemonsmith. A Knight's greaves are jagged blades, well suited to slicing through the flesh of the enemy. Even the frightful reputation of the Knights of Tzeentch is a weapon in its own right, crippling those who would stand against them before a single blow is struck.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh3_main_unit_long_text_tze_cav_doom_knights_1	Doom Knights are some of the most powerful mortals the world has ever seen. They tame the Discs of Tzeentch and thus consider themselves superior even to other champions of Chaos. Screeching through the air like few before them, they would be a wonderous sight to behold if their coming did not always spell death and, as is their namesake, total and utter doom. There is no escape from the Doom Knights, and as you would be right to expect, they show no mercy whatsoever.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh3_main_unit_long_text_tze_cha_cultist	Tzeentchian cultists are a unique group. Clandestine worship of their God is more common, especially in Cathay, than for the other Chaos Gods due to his secretive and manipulative nature. At the same time, interpreting the Changer's wishes is more challenging than for the more straightforward Khorne or Slaanesh, for whom copious amounts of bodily fluids are usually enough, and a chance to celebrate their Lord with a simple battle is preferable. Strange masks, complicated rituals, and endless scheming and plotting mark out the Cultists of Tzeentch, for whom nothing is ever simple and everything has many facets and aspects to be considered.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh3_main_unit_long_text_tze_cha_exalted_lord_of_change	A Lord of Change is hideously unpredictable and manipulative. Behind its gaze lies a curious and wreckful mind, deeply intelligent, yet as uncaring of consequence as it is fascinated by it. It is like a child playing upon some gigantic anthill, poking with a stick at its inhabitants and laughing at the hopeless antics of their defence. Nothing pleases him more than to see the world broken and made anew, to redirect the course of a life or even history itself, spilling hope upon the ground while raising the ambition of others up to an unexpected pinnacle of power.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh3_main_unit_long_text_tze_cha_herald_of_tzeentch_0	As the magically fashioned slaves of Tzeentch, Horrors are considered automatons to be expended as part of a carefully wrought plan. Should a servant of greater power be required, Tzeentch will create a Herald, a more stable type of Horror. Such Daemons have enough consciousness to direct others of their kind without constant guidance from a Lord of Change, directing furious sorcery against Tzeentch's enemies. The mere presence of a Herald of Tzeentch drastically increases the abilities of nearby Daemons, mutating them into new and stronger forms and empowering their magic.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh3_main_unit_long_text_tze_cha_herald_of_tzeentch_1	Should a servant of greater power be required, Tzeentch will create a Herald, a more stable type of Horror. A Screamer has to be transmuted into a new form before it can safely be used as a mount. These Discs of Tzeentch retain the flattened and manta-like shape of the Screamer, but their magical bodies are transformed into unlikely shapes and aspects as part of the binding ritual. As a result, some Discs of Tzeentch are covered in eyes, whilst others are sheathed in living metal, feathers, scales or any one of a thousand, thousand possible combinations.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh3_main_unit_long_text_tze_cha_herald_of_tzeentch_2	Heralds have little patience at the best of times, and none at all in training Screamers and Discs. They therefore consider 'borrowing' a chariot from an Exalted Flamer to be entirely in keeping with their status. Such a feat requires great cunning indeed if the Herald in question wishes to escape the Flamer's wrath. However, all these trials and tribulations seem as naught once the Herald is free to swoop and dive across the battlefield on his new possession, cackling madly as he unleashes his fearsome Sorceries upon the enemies of his Dark God.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh3_main_unit_long_text_tze_cha_iridescent_horror_0	As the magically fashioned slaves of Tzeentch, Horrors are considered automatons to be expended as part of a carefully wrought plan. Should a servant of greater power be required, Tzeentch will create an Iridescent Horror, a more stable type of Horror. Iridescent Horrors are often the same lurid hue as Pink Horrors, but do not morph into a pair of Blue Horrors when struck. Such Daemons have enough consciousness to direct others of their kind without constant guidance from a Lord of Change, directing furious sorcery against Tzeentch's enemies. 	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh3_main_unit_long_text_tze_cha_iridescent_horror_1	The Daemonic steeds of Tzeentch are known as Discs. These bizarre creations are neither Daemon nor construction, but a nightmarish blend of the two. Coruscating with mystical force, Discs fly above the ground, skimming gently forwards upon the Winds of Magic. While the legions of Tzeentch march to war, His proud Sorcerers drift above them on the floating Discs, raining magical fire upon their foes. The Discs themselves are far from defenceless, lashing out around themselves with bolts of magical fire, or manifesting whirling tentacles and ripping claws to slash at enemies that approach too close.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh3_main_unit_long_text_tze_cha_iridescent_horror_2	Burning Chariots of Tzeentch hurtle across the Realm of Chaos like incandescent meteors, bringing the Great Sorcerer's chosen emissaries to every corner of existence. As they blaze through the heavens of the mortal world, Chariots of Tzeentch are commonly mistaken for comets, which are in turn interpreted as omens of great events and terrible wars. The Iridescent Horrors who ride atop the Burning Chariots are able to channel Sorcery to a far greater extent than their lesser brethren, and can conjure up great billowing sheets of Warp-magic, or hurl bolts of Sorcerous change that make the very air sizzle with their passing.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh3_main_unit_long_text_tze_cha_kairos_fateweaver	Kairos can see things that are hidden even to Tzeentch. His right head sees possible futures as clear as day. No scheme is hidden from its sight and the infinite possibilities of tomorrow crystallise into irrefutable fact. Kairos' left head sees the past without the petty colourations of perspective and bias. Valuable as this vision is, it comes with a heavy cost. Both of Kairos' heads are blind to the present; he cannot see time as it passes - only events that are to come or whose time has already lapsed.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh3_main_unit_long_text_tze_inf_blue_horrors_0	When wounded, a Pink Horror exhales a final lunatic cackle before rapidly decomposing into an ectoplasmic blob of gyrating magic, which swiftly alters colour and divides into two Blue Horrors – diminutive replicas of their parent Daemon. Blue Horrors are sullen and malicious, like evil­tempered children, and sneer and grumble their way through a battle. Once spawned, they add a deeper whining note to the incessant chortling of the group as they attempt to grapple with enemies and squeeze the life from them, before inevitably wandering off in search of fresh entertainment.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh3_main_unit_long_text_tze_inf_chaos_furies_0	Furies are yowling shards of malevolent energy – Chaos in its purest form. With little in the way of intelligence, they are utterly subservient to the whims of the Dark Gods, and shift in aspect and power as the balance of the dark pantheon alters. They are easily subjugated by other Daemons, whom they regard with a mix of dread and awe. Furies swarm at the edges of the battle, avoiding the thickest fighting if they can. Only when they sight a vulnerable victim do they descend, a wailing mass from which there can  be no escape. 	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh3_main_unit_long_text_tze_inf_forsaken_0	Many Warriors of Chaos find that the rewards of the Gods turn out to more closely resemble afflictions than blessings. In time, many Forsaken lose any capacity for rational thought, setting aside sophisticated weaponry in favour of jagged teeth and twisted claws. They have no intelligence glinting within their black eyes, for their minds churn with nothing more than thoughts of killing and devouring everything they can catch. These atavistic warriors often bear ever-twisting assortments of mutations, including writhing tentacles, chitinous claws, extra heads and hairy, grasping limbs that push out through their armour.	false

unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh3_main_unit_long_text_tze_mon_lord_of_change_0	As might be expected of a creature born of pure magic and bound to the will of the Master of Sorcery, a Lord of Change is a potent spellcaster. The Winds of Magic obey his every command, allowing him to summon whirling tempests of change and mutation, blast the enemies of Tzeentch with bolts of multicoloured fire or unravel the mind of an enemy spellcaster from the inside. Although a Lord of Change elects to use magic and trickery to further its ends, he is still a fearsome fighter. Countless heroes have underestimated these strange creatures, thinking their wiry frames and fluttering wings fragile.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh3_main_unit_long_text_tze_mon_screamers_0	Screamers are glimmering sky-sharks that ride upon the Winds of Magic as a bird glides upon the breeze. They roam the tides of magic, preying upon the shadow-souls of mortal creatures, lone Chaos Furies and other unfortunate magical ephemera. Once the Screamers catch their doomed prey it is torn to pieces in an eye-blink, the gossamer shreds of its soul-stuff offered up as a gift to Tzeentch. So swift and agile are Screamers that they are highly sought after as steeds, however their instinctive nature swiftly proves calamitous should their controller's attention wander.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh3_main_unit_long_text_tze_mon_soul_grinder_0	When a Daemon's physical body is slain, he can surrender his true name to the Forge of Souls. The dark bargain thus sealed, his crippled essence is bound to a mighty Warp-metal hulk. Thus is he reborn as a Soul Grinder. A Soul Grinder's clanking tread shakes the ground with every step, and it is devilishly fast for a creature its size, able to scuttle swift as a horse's gallop, or even faster should the scent of battle touch its nostrils. Piston-driven legs thud home with sickening force, crushing to bloody paste those beneath.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh3_main_unit_long_text_tze_mon_spawn_of_tzeentch_0	A creature visited by too many gifts of the Dark Gods inevitably succumbs to madness and mutation, and becomes a Chaos Spawn. A once-­humanoid form that has sprouted and burst into an obscene and monstrous anatomy, mutated almost beyond recognition. The eyes of the original creature peer out, a glint of its former personality barely perceptible amidst the fleshy ruin. Chaos Spawn are creatures of unspeakable horror, their twisted bodies sporting an impossible array of spines, eyes and mouths.	false

As they blaze through the heavens of the mortal world, Chariots of Tzeentch are commonly mistaken for comets, which are in turn interpreted as omens of great events and terrible wars. The Discs and Screamers which make up the bizarre chariot are drawn to raw magic like moths to a flame, and therefore to the Exalted Flamers, who exude tasty sorcery from every pore and wrinkle of their fungoid flesh.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh3_pro11_chs_cha_harald_hammerstorm	Tales of the Norse and Kurgan speak of the legend of Harald Hammerstorm, a forgotten warrior responsible for one of the greatest feats of arms ever seen in the north. It was while plundering an ancient tomb-city in the Chaos Wastes that Harald’s warband found themselves face-to-face with a vast Undead army, roused from their slumber with rusted blades and eyes aglow with witchfire. With no escape and against seemingly insurmountable odds, Harald formed the point of a wedge driving through the skeletal warriors, his followers pressing in behind him as his hammer rose and fell in monotonous destruction. After a day and a night, nothing remained but a hill of broken bones. Such odds had truly never been overcome by a mortal of the north.\\n\\nHarald’s legend was once known throughout the world, but over time became overshadowed by those of "greater" men, something he will surely make right! 	false

unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh3_twa10_ksl_inf_armoured_kossars_ror	The Watchmen are – by decree of the Tzarina – infallible in their interpretation of the law. The penalties they select are always appropriate for the crimes in question. They are never seen to wrongly convict, and while they may arrest and extract confessions from those later proved to be innocent, it is no fault of theirs, for their actions are always justified. Yet Katarin does not intend to institute a reign of terror; she wants only to be able to deal with her enemies quickly and efficiently. Thus the most important qualification for becoming a Watchman is absolute loyalty to her, closely followed by competence. Those who display excessive cruelty do not last long in the prestigious ranks, while the incompetent generally die in the course of their duty – such is their vocation.	false

unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh_dlc01_unit_long_text_chs_chaos_sorcerer_lord_shadows	Those champions of Chaos who seek mastery over the magical arts are known as Chaos Sorcerers, and they are madmen and malcontents all. Chaos Sorcerers wield the wild energies of entropy itself, reshaping reality to better serve their whims and those of their dark masters. A word and a gesture from a Chaos Sorcerer can strip a man's flesh from his bones, force a lover to murder his beloved, or cause a regiment of soldiers to burst into flame. They are amongst the most awful and depraved of all servants of Chaos, for they long ago sold their souls in exchange for the heady elixir of pure power. Where many of the world's Wizards, such as those taught by the Colleges of Magic in Altdorf, glean their arcane skill from long years of painstaking research, a Chaos Sorcerer's understanding of the Winds of Magic is instant and innate. However, without the patience and wisdom that such study brings, a Chaos Sorcerer lacks due wariness and respect for the ultimate dangers of magic, and so begins an inexorable descent into deformity and madness. Many are the paths that lead to this ultimate fate, but most often, the Chaos Sorcerer seeks to expand his magical powers or harness more of the occult by simply bartering away another fraction of his soul, losing a little more of his humanity in the process. Before long, the aspirant feels his whole body and mind twist and alter, and as the gnawed remnants of his soul are finally devoured, he is plunged into the whirlpools of insanity, leaving behind nothing of the man who was.	false

unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh_dlc02_unit_long_text_vmp_blood_knights	Blood Knights are the most fearsome cavalry in all of the Old World. The training and discipline they received in life is enhanced by the unnatural speed and strength of the Vampiric curse. Blood Knights are nigh-on indestructible, riding with fangs bared through storms of arrow and shot. Such is their honour that they will refuse no martial challenge and will fight at the forefront of an Undead army without question. It is said that even the fabled Grail Knights of Bretonnia cannot match the Blood Knights lance-for-lance upon the field. Over time, the Blood Knights have become a macabre parody of the virtuous Templars that Walach turned. Though they retain the Dragon as their symbol, with blazons and crests in their likeness, their armour is encrusted with images of death and slaughter. Their blades are fell weapons inscribed with dark runes, chased with precious metals and fashioned in the likenesses of evil beasts. The Knights do not ride flesh-and-blood horses, but instead charge across the field of battle upon evil Nightmares clad in thick barding painted with the disturbing icons of Necromantic power.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh_dlc03_unit_long_text_amber_wizard	The Wizards of the Amber Order are renowned for their savage appearance; their hair is wild and unkempt and they dress in furs adorned with bones, feathers, amber beads and primitive talismans. Few Wizards can withstand the touch of Amber Magic, for it is the magic of bestial minds and untamed places, caring little for the ways of civilised cultures. The power of the Wind of Ghur resides most strongly in the thoughts of savage creatures and, as a result, Amber Wizards can commune with animals of all kinds. They also have the ability to assume the strength of the greatest beasts and can induce primal states of terror in others.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh_dlc03_unit_long_text_boris_todbringer	Boris Todbringer is a man of blunt truth and affirmative action, but in the election for Emperor of 2502 he was outplayed by the "foolish young pup" Karl Franz and his allies. Finding himself in the shadow of the Cult of Sigmar and denied the throne, Todbringer raged at the newly-anointed Emperor until the Beastmen raids into the Drakwald reminded him that his sacred duties were more important than mere political squabbles, no matter the cost to his status. Like all Middenheimers and men of Ulric, Boris Todbringer never takes a challenge lightly, and so brought total war to the Beastmen and their leader, Khazrak. The feud between them became the stuff of legend; Boris took one of Khazrak's eyes only to lose one of his own by the Beastlord's hand at a later date. This visceral struggle made Todbringer forget his political rivalry with Altdorf in favour of a worthier cause: fighting evil in the Drakwald – the seemingly impossible task of cleansing the forest of its bestial taint and bringing security to the Empire's borderlands.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh_dlc03_unit_long_text_bst_beastlord	The Beastlords of the warherds are hairy, musclebound brutes possessed of a raw and savage might. They carry themselves with swaggering confidence, revelling in their own superiority over lesser beasts. Their thick, hairy skulls are crowned with magnificent sets of horns as sharp and hard as any blade, and their robust and heavily-thewed bodies are covered with scar tissue and crudely-rendered tattoos. The threat of violence is implicit in their every gesture. Upon the battlefield a Beastlord is a force of untold destruction, gouging and butchering with horn, blade and claw.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh_dlc03_unit_long_text_bst_bestigor_herd	The strongest and meanest of the Beastmen footsoldiers are known as Bestigors. Their size and ferocity means they carve a privileged position within the warherd, enforcing their superiority over the Gors and Ungors with random acts of excessive violence. In battle, Bestigors form a solid, armoured mass of muscle and iron that charges forward with a terrifying momentum. They seek out the elite of the enemy army - who inherently challenge their dominant status - then wield their huge axes like executioner's blades, hewing the foe limb from limb and trampling their broken bodies into the mud beneath their unshod hooves.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh_dlc03_unit_long_text_bst_bray_shaman	The Bray-Shamans of the Beastmen are vile to behold, their filthy bodies covered in matted fur into which all manner of crude fetishes and grim charms are woven. Their twisted features are often covered in a ragged hood, and they bear heavy braystafs as both brutal weapons and symbols of their position within the warherd. Bray-Shamans occupy a unique niche in the brutal and bitter world of the Beastmen; they have no need to defend themselves from other members of their tribe, for none would dare assault them. Not even the mightiest Beastlord would harm a Bray-Shaman, for they speak the will of the Dark Gods, and those that defy the Gods pay the highest price of all.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh_dlc03_unit_long_text_bst_centigors	Centigors are a disturbing cross between four-legged creatures, such as horses and oxen, and the bipedal beasts of Chaos, merged together by the Ruinous Powers in ages past. They possess the hindquarters and forelegs of their quadruped ancestors, granting them great speed and strength, but the upper body of a humanoid, with which they wield brutal weapons. Vital and crude, these beast-centaurs are powerful creatures but lack the dexterity to manipulate objects with any skill or control. As the sun rises and the warherds march from the Herdstone to make war upon man, the Centigors rouse themselves from their stupors, taking up the weapons of the Beastmen and galloping to war beside them.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh_dlc03_unit_long_text_bst_chaos_spawn	Some amongst the Children of Chaos are bestowed with an abundance of the Dark Ones' gifts, becoming creatures whose bodily forms epitomise nightmare and unreason. Such creatures might once have been great Chieftains who called upon the favour of the Dark Gods one time too many. They might have been Bray-Shamans who drew too deep of the power of Chaos, their forms blasted beyond recognition by the raw power of Magic. It may even have been one who strayed too close to Morghur, Master of Skulls, whose aura of transmogrification changes all. In some cases, the creature might simply have been born that way, in all likelihood slaughtering its beast-mother in the process. When the warherd goes to battle, the Chaos spawn come shambling from their lairs. The Beastmen have no control over a Spawn's actions, and it will behave in a largely unpredictable manner. The Spawn will move towards the enemy and crash flailing into its ranks; teeth, claws, and tentacles tearing men limb from limb in a shower of blood and ruination before it is finally put out of its misery.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh_dlc03_unit_long_text_bst_chaos_warhounds	In the dark forests, twisted Warhounds stalk the night in search of prey. Their red, evilly-glinting eyes peer from the treeline, and saliva pools upon the litter-strewn ground as they taste the air for the scent of their next victim. Many a lone patrolman travelling in the woods at night has shivered at the sound of baleful howling in the distance, only to be confronted by the low growling of the pack that had crept up behind him whilst he was distracted. Regardless of form, Warhounds are all vicious killers and their harsh baying is a sure warning of the slaughter to come. They bound across the battlefield at an alarming speed, so a Handgunner will have scant moments to take his shot and no hope of reloading before their powerful claws rake him to the ground and knife-like fangs close around his throat.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh_dlc03_unit_long_text_bst_cygor	Cygors are distant cousins of Minotaurs but, because they hail from the most tainted of all the realms of the Old World, they have diverged greatly from their kin. They are huge, hideously malformed giants, each possessed of a single eye in the centre of its forehead. Through this eye the Cygor is cursed to see not the material realm that mortals perceive, but the ever-shifting Winds of Chaos as they blow through and around the indistinct, ghostly shapes that populate their world. Assailed by such visions since birth, Cygors are all quite mad. The sheer size and ferocity of a Cygor is terrifying enough to mortals, but those who know of their terrible hunger fear them above all else. To the mage, a Cygor is utterly fearsome, for he knows that of all the warriors on the field of battle it is him alone the Cygor wishes to catch in its gnarled and calloused hands, his flesh it wants to tear apart, and his soul it must devour to slake its unending thirst.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh_dlc03_unit_long_text_bst_feral_manticore	Manticores are huge, leonine beasts that soar on leathery wings. They are amongst the most powerful of all the predators that live in the north’s mountain ranges. The mutating power of Chaos ensures that no two Manticores are truly alike. Some have manes of writhing serpents, others pelts of iron scales, and many sprout spiked tales with a poison strong enough to boil a man’s blood in his veins. However, all Manticores are berserk killers saturated with primal fury. They are so fierce that they are held by the Dark Elves to be incarnations of Khaine, God of Murder.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh_dlc03_unit_long_text_bst_giants	Giants are monstrous humanoids with boundless strength and a prodigious appetite for violence, flesh, and alcohol. They are most often encountered in the far north of the world, being fond of cold, rocky climes. However, some do make the deep forest their homes, whilst others descend from lairs in the World's Edge or Middle Mountains to join bands of Beastmen. Those that live in the forest are a particularly vile example of their breed. Their skin is often covered in green and brown mould, fungus and moss, whilst their long beards are matted and tangled with ivy and creepers. Giants do not make common cause with the warherds, instead following in their wake, joining in with the slaughter and slaking their hunger on cattle and their thirst on looted barrels of ale. Occasionally one of the forest-dwellers might be bound to the will of a shaman by way of dark arts. Such a beast, emerging from the trees, trailing rotting litter, swathed in twisting vines and stinking of rank, woodland decay is enough to fill superstitious soldiers with heart-stopping horror.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh_dlc03_unit_long_text_bst_gor_herd	Gors form the great mass of the warherds. Their appearance varies, but all combine bestial features with those of a man. The base form of the Beastmen, and that possessed by the vast majority of the Gors, is the head and legs of a goat and the upper torso of a man, albeit a particularly hairy and malodorous one.

unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh_dlc03_unit_long_text_bst_khazrak_one_eye	Possessing a ruthless cunning far above that of his bestial kin, Khazrak the One-Eye is the most dangerous and powerful Beastlord in the Drakwald. He has plagued the region for years, descending without warning and then slipping away into the shadows once more. Khazrak has a unique ability to control and harness the unruly spirit of the herd and devise simple but effective battle plans. He is unlike most Beastmen, his patient and cunning mind at odds with the normal headstrong nature of his kind. Khazrak's warband roams the Drakwald terrorising the townships and roads, and never before has a Beastman leader proven so elusive to retribution. No one is spared in Khazrak's attacks, his superbly trained Warhounds chasing down the few who manage to escape.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh_dlc03_unit_long_text_bst_malagor_the_dark_omen	The Beastmen believe that Malagor is the doom of mankind personified. He is a figure of nightmare across the entire Great Forest, revered by the Beastmen but feared above all by superstitious humans. To man, Malagor represents the downfall of all they hold dear. Vilified by the Cult of Sigmar as the epitome of sin due to his many blasphemies, a sighting of Malagor is the most terrifying portent of all. He is the winged fiend that rises from the benighted forests to challenge the gods of men. He is the devil rendered in woodcut in ancient tomes, kept under lock and key lest the terrible secrets within blast the sanity of any who read them.	false

Often growing to twice the height of a man and far greater in muscular bulk, their thick-skulled heads are broad and ugly, and their horns can eviscerate with a single thrust. Many have the cloven-hoofed hindquarters of a beast and other deformities of the body that the touch of Chaos brings. Though less intelligent than Beastmen, they are unnaturally strong and powerful, and make formidable warriors. To the Minotaurs, the battlefield is a place of maddening excess. The scent of gore in their flaring nostrils drives them wild and they bellow their hunger for all to hear. They charge with a thundering impact, horns lowered to impale, then strike blow after blow against their hapless enemy. Once their victims have been hacked apart, the Minotaurs slake their thirst by tearing at the raw flesh with their gore-encrusted nails and gulping down great hunks of steaming meat whilst the battle rages on around them.	false

unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh_dlc03_unit_long_text_bst_razorgor_chariot	Razorgors are massive cousins of the Tuskgors, mountains of mutated muscle and hair that are deadly in the extreme. As with all Children of Chaos, Razorgors are disfigured by hideous mutations, but they generally have the aspect of a nightmarish, gigantic boar covered in spines, tusks and coarse hair. Though Razorgors are voracious omnivores, they prefer a diet of fresh meat, and Beastmen are their natural prey. Still, such is their appetite and fearsome metabolism that they are able to gobble down a knight in full plate mail and his barded horse in a matter of seconds. It is a widely-held belief by the tribes of the woods that Razorgor have two natural states: a digestive torpor that sets in after they have gorged themselves, and blind, unthinking rage, which is by far the more common of the two. Once every decade or so a particularly powerful Beastlord will manage to harness several Razorgors at once. These are either herded into a loose pack and sent headlong into the enemy ranks, or used individually to pull chariots manned by the largest Bestigors. Regardless of who rides them, Razorgor chariots cannot truly be steered or directed - in fact all too often the crew can do little more than hold on tight as the chariot careens toward the foe. Razorgors have beady eyes and poor vision, but when they catch sight of the enemy they are nigh-on uncontrollable. A charging Razorgor can flatten a tree or smash through a chapel wall when roused, so the mess that one of these snorting monstrosities at full charge can make of even the stoutest shieldwall is truly sickening.	false

unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh_dlc03_unit_long_text_bst_ungor_herd	Ungors (meaning 'no-horns' in the Beastmen tongue) are not as strong or robust of frame as the Gors, but they more than make up for it in sheer malevolence. They are physically smaller than other Beastmen and their horns, if they have any, are less impressive and numerous. While Gors may have long and spectacular horns as deadly as any sword, Ungors usually have short prongs or horn buds sprouting from their skulls, not recognisable as those of a goat or any other type of beast acknowledged by the Gors. Due to this, they are not considered to be 'proper' Beastmen. The race of men, on the other hand, does not draw such distinctions. To them the Ungors are just as horrible, horns or no, for they are twisted aberrations of nature that live to murder and despoil all that is good and wholesome. Ungors are considerably more dextrous than their fellows, their sinewy hands able to carve runes, build wooden structures, and fix and bind the weaponry of their clumsier Gor brethren. So it is that Ungors fulfil a vital role in the society of the tribe, for without them, the herd would soon be bereft of weaponry. Most Ungors take to the field in large herds, arming themselves with stout spears with which to impale their prey and carrying crude shields to protect their grotesque pot-bellied bodies. In battle, Ungors are bullied into a semblance of order by the largest of their number, known as Halfhorns, who seeks a position in the battle line from which they can inflict the most pain and suffering upon the foe.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh_dlc03_unit_long_text_bst_ungor_raiders	Ungor Raiders have been tasked with seeking out enemies for the warherds to prey upon. They have a knowledge of the wilderness unsurpassed by even the most intelligent Gor, and it is they who sow the seeds of mayhem, seeds that soon blossom into full-blown destruction once the warherd falls upon its victims. Bands of Ungor Raiders range ahead of the warherd as it travels through the lands, sending runners back and forth to ensure the Beastmen army can bring its might to bear at the right place and time. Intelligence provided by Ungor Raiders enables the warherds to encircle and trap the foe, to launch ambushes from hidden paths and moss-choked vales, and to cut off the escape routes of those that believe there is still a route to safety.	false

unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh_dlc04_unit_long_text_emp_arch_lector	The High Priest of the Cult of Sigmar is the Grand Theogonist, and beneath him are his two Arch Lectors - grim, imposing figures, both on and off the battlefield. As the Emperor is believed to be the living incarnation of Sigmar, all Electors may cast a vote to decide who is crowned the next ruler of the Empire, though they may not ever become Emperor themselves. In these dark times, where the curse of Undeath and the worship of Chaos infest the Empire, it is the duty of Arch Lectors to protect the populace and cast out such evils. They epitomise the warrior courage of Sigmar himself, leading from the front where they manifest the power of the gods and inspire whole armies to acts of heroism.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh_dlc04_unit_long_text_emp_cav_knights_blazing_sun	The Knightly Order of the Blazing Sun is held as a prized ally by many Elector Counts, despite its rather unusual origins. It was founded during a strange and prophetic occurrence at the Battle of Magritta, when Estalia was liberated from Arabyan invaders. A group of Knights fighting for the city had been driven into a temple of the warrior goddess Myrmidia when they were ambushed and quickly outnumbered. Just as death seemed certain, a mighty earthquake shook the temple and a huge bronze statue of the goddess plummeted downwards, crushing many of the Arabyan warriors. Seeing this as a sign from the heavens, the Knights fought on bravely and drove the remaining invaders away, shortly thereafter establishing the Order of the Blazing Sun, with Myrmidia as its patron.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh_dlc04_unit_long_text_emp_flagellants	The Empire is a dangerous and often cruel place. Wars, plagues and the predations of terrible monsters can destroy whole towns and force their inhabitants to become beggars, vagabonds and brigands. All who endure such hardships are hardened by their losses, yet some are driven over the edge of sanity by their suffering. Many of these dishevelled wretches see their plight as a morbid sign that the Empire is about to collapse, an irrefutable portent that these are the last, desperate days of a dying world. These men revel in their despair, despondent in all things yet manic in their pronouncements of doom. When battle is joined, bands of crazed Flagellants beat themselves into a frenzy before charging headlong towards the enemy. They throw themselves into the fray without hesitation, against the most hopeless of odds. With howls of doom on their lips and visions of martyrdom in their thoughts, Flagellants fight with wild ferocity, swinging their flails at their enemies and leaving trails of blood and woe in their wake. Heedless of danger or injury, these madmen will continue to fight with reckless abandon until each and every one of them lies dead or dying on the battlefield, thus vindicating their belief that the end is indeed nigh.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh_dlc04_unit_long_text_emp_free_company_militia	Whilst state troops form the mainstay of the Empire’s military forces, its armies are often bulked out by ad hoc regiments of militia who are recruited, willingly or not, to fight as and when required. No one can foretell how many will turn up at the muster, or what their fighting quality will be. After all, these irregular troops receive no formal training or discipline. Many militias are formed of townsfolk and villagers levied from the local countryside – brave men standing ready to defend their homes and families against the monsters and beasts that constantly threaten them. Other militias are bands of mercenaries, bandits or other curs used to living by the strength of their sword arm, hired or pressed into service.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh_dlc04_unit_long_text_emp_volkmar_the_grim	Volkmar the Grim is the head of the Cult of Sigmar and the most powerful religious leader in the Empire. He is a pious and foreboding man who is utterly devoted to the destruction of Chaos in all its forms. When the Grand Theogonist accompanies an army into battle, he typically rides atop the resplendent War Altar of Sigmar, inspiring the soldiers around him to great acts of heroism as he strikes the followers of Chaos down with powerful blows and words of divine force. Volkmar is a holy terror on the battlefield, a man who fights with the fury of Sigmar himself. It is said that Volkmar's soul was forged of steel and he fights the malign influence of Chaos with every fibre of his being.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh_dlc04_unit_long_text_vmp_corpse_cart	Corpse Carts act like magnets for Dark Magic, drawing their power from the land itself and re-animating the dead around them. Sometimes a Corpse Cart is hung with a great bell, the clapper of which is a fell lodestone of eldritch provenance. When Necromantic magic is thick in the air, the bell tolls and ripples of Dark Magic emanate from the Corpse Cart. Under the influence of this ominous knell, the dead are drawn back together and cadavers stagger to their feet. Other Corpse Carts are lit by braziers that burn with infernal flames. The smoke from these 'balefires' contains particles of Warpstone that can drive enemy Wizards temporarily insane. Though most were hunted down and put to the torch, for more than a thousand years the remaining Corpse Carts have wandered along the back roads and dirt tracks of Sylvania, wearing death and misery like a shroud. On dark nights, they enter ramshackle villages, stirring the dead in their graves and filling the dreams of slumbering peasants with visions of rot and death. These strange constructs are valued highly by Vampires, for Undead creatures near a Corpse Cart will fight with frenetic vigour, bolstering the battle line of their armies.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh_dlc04_unit_long_text_vmp_helman_ghorst	Helman Ghorst was once a man, yet that life was ripped from him by the uncaring vicissitudes of fate. The loss of his father and brothers to plague sent Ghorst into an obsessive madness; he began studying the black arts in the hope of returning his lost kith to life. Inevitably, he drew the attention of the Witch Hunter, von Kordon, and so abandoned Templehof and fled to Vargravia, taking the corpses of his brothers and father with him, determined to find a way to return them to life through Necromancy. It was here, forsaken in a corrupted land, that he attracted the attention of Mannfred von Carstein. Rather than killing Ghorst, the Count revealed further dark secrets to him, transforming Helman into something beyond the grief-maddened man from Templehof. Now, he is carried through the night on a bone-ridged cart, pulled not by horses, but by the brothers he so desperately wished to save – each a once-handsome farrier restored to a mockery of life, forced to stumble along at the head of their kin’s unloving host.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh_dlc04_unit_long_text_vmp_mortis_engine	Many Necromancers and liche-lords have risen to kingship over the Undead, becoming so saturated with evil power that their physical forms radiate magic. Some Vampires actively seek out the citadels of those lords who have gone before, hoping to take possession of their remains and to use them against the living. No mere casket or hearse could be fit to bear the remains of one of these masters of the night. Instead, they are enshrined within a Mortis Engine, a cage of fused bone, surrounded by trappings of grandeur and borne to war by a host of spirits bound to the infernal device. Some reliquaries also carry blasphemous tomes to battle, or scrolls of parchment rumoured to have been penned by Nagash himself. Oft-times the Winds of Magic become night uncontrollable when such a fell tome is near. Heavy with evil magics, painstakingly illuminated with such care that their creator's souls have passed into the leaves of human skin that form its pages, these books can be a boon to the twisted practitioners of Necromancy, but also the bane of reckless and unwary spellcasters.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh_dlc04_unit_long_text_vmp_strigoi_ghoul_king	The pallid creatures known as Ghoul Kings are in fact once-proud Strigoi Vampires forced into a troglodytic existence. Though all Strigoi descend from the same ancient lineage of Ushoran, they have devolved to become something far fouler and more hate-filled than their brethren. The Ghoul Kings spend their days creeping through the hidden places of the world, but under cover of night, they will wreak their vengeance at the head of a shambling army of Undead. At times, powerful Strigoi Ghoul Kings raise vast armies around themselves and push south in a desperate attempt to recreate the kingdom they lost. So far, their advance has always been halted by the warmongering tribes of Greenskins blocking the way to the Badlands, or by disciplined armies of the Tomb Kings that stride out from the desert. Yet across the Old World, the minions of the Ghoul Kings have been sighted ever more frequently. Some say the ancient brethren of the Strigoi are uniting under one leader and massing great armies of degenerate beasts in their cavernous lairs. If this is true, no creature - living or dead - is truly safe from their wrath.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh_dlc04_unit_long_text_vmp_vlad_von_carstein	Vlad von Carstein was the first and greatest of the Vampire Counts of Sylvania. A master swordsman and skilled general with no small aptitude in the magical arts, it was he who tainted the aristocracy of Sylvania with the curse of vampirism, and in doing so, created an Undead kingdom at the heart of the Empire. Count Vlad was a towering figure, with a mane of long hair and piercing eyes. Those who met him and survived described him as possessed of a "feral charm", but with an evil temper that could turn into a berserk fury if he was thwarted in his endeavours. It is said that at such times, only his wife, Isabella, could calm him without blood being spilled. No records tell of Vlad's origins before his coming to Sylvania. Even the Vampires of that realm know nothing of his life before that fateful night in Drakenhof, and Vlad certainly never recounted or wrote down his personal history. That he knew much about the workings of the Empire, and its internal division at the time of his arrival, attests to knowledge of the dealings of mortal men for many years.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh_dlc05_unit_long_text_bst_harpies	Harpies are particularly loathsome Children of Chaos, winged creatures with a body that is a parody of a human woman. From a distance they may appear lithe and shapely, even darkly alluring, yet as they close their true nature becomes clear. A Harpy’s face is distorted and twisted, with nothing of humanity or intelligence in its eyes, only instinctive cruelty. Its lips are not those of a woman, but are twisted and leering, pulled back to reveal needle-like teeth dripping with blood and saliva. The creature’s limbs are not soft or shapely, but hard and possessed of tendons like steel, that lend it preternatural speed and agility.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh_dlc05_unit_long_text_bst_morghur	The vile, twisted creature known as Morghur is the essence of mutation and corruption given form. His coarse hair is woven through with gibbering, shrieking skulls, and his form flows and reshapes with every passing second. Morghur's lair is deep within a cave near the Forest of Arden. The dank, stone walls flow like water in his presence, constantly reforming to mirror the dark visions that plague him. Morghur's mind is filled with images of destruction and desolation. Hatred boils within his heart, and he is consumed with the desire to make his waking-dreams become reality -- to rip down civilisation in all its forms, to shatter order wherever it is found and to change the world constantly and randomly. As he walks the world, everything in his presence is irrevocably twisted. Grass grows in disturbing patterns beneath his hooves, streams flow backwards and animals mutate horribly.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh_dlc05_unit_long_text_emp_grey_wizard	The Grey Order is the most secretive of all the Colleges of Magic. Indeed, though its members refer to themselves as Grey Guardians, just who, or what, they might be guarding remains unknown to outsiders. The Grey Order studies spells of concealment and illusion, which do not lend themselves well to the favour or ordinary folk. They are sometimes called Trickster Wizards, though never to their faces. More commonly, they are referred to as Grey Wizards, named after the colour of their robes, hats and wild, wolfish beards. They are wanderers who are often employed to deliver vital messages across the Empire. What makes this so mysterious is that they seem to cover the vast distances involved almost invisibly and at impossible speed.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh_dlc05_unit_long_text_emp_jade_wizard	The Wizards of the Jade Order embrace the Wind of Ghyran, symbolised by the Coil of Life. The wandering mages of this Order are druids who harness the energy of nature, often walking barefoot to better feel the energy of Ghyran through their feet. A Jade Wizard's power is linked to the seasons, being vigorous in Spring, powerful in the Summer, waning over the Autumn and weakest in the Winter months. With a gesture, they can summon forth forests to obey their commands, and with a touch they can heal fallen comrades. Jade Wizards tend to roam the dark forests where Life Magic flows more freely, learning of imminent threats from the before returning to Altdorf with the news.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh_dlc05_unit_long_text_vmp_red_duke	The histories of Bretonnia are littered with dukes who err from the path of righteousness and fall, irreparably, into madness and depravity. So it is with the Red Duke; a warrior of terrifying renown who now wages war across Bretonnia in search of ever-greater power. He is an Undead scourge upon the kingdom, but it was not always so. He was once the Duke of Aquitaine, a mighty warrior who quested determinedly in the Lady’s name. However, he was struck down by mysterious illness that claimed his body and ravaged his soul. He was interred by his Knights in a grand tomb worthy of his successes, yet he rose again three nights later as a vicious, hateful Vampire, in defiance of all things good and natural. Uncaring of the life he had before, the Red Duke now takes residence in the cursed city of Mousillon, warring endlessly against King Louen, desiring that Bretonnia yield entirely to him or face total annihilation!	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh_dlc05_unit_long_text_wef_ancient_treemen	Of all the Treemen of Athel Loren, there are those - old beyond mortal reckoning - whose names are revered above all others; these are the Treemen Ancients. When the first pact between forest and Elf was formed, it was they who spoke on behalf of Athel Loren, and they were old even then. Treeman Ancients seldom rouse themselves to war; they find the colours of the waking world less vibrant as they get older and so steadily retreat into the dreaming lands of sleep where their magics nurture and shape the forest's growth. Thus do the Treeman Ancients pass through the centuries in a state of dormancy, tended by a small group of Dryads. Only when dire times befall are they awoken from slumber, for only with their leadership can Athel Loren be roused to its full fury.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh_dlc05_unit_long_text_wef_branchwraith	Branchwraiths are the oldest of the Dryads. They have ever served as the handmaidens to the Ancients of Athel Loren, and attend to the Treemen with a dedication bordering upon the fanatical. Yet before the coming of the Elves, the Branchwraiths were so much more. In those days, it was they who ruled the forest and they who tamed the Winds of Magic to bring sustenance to bough and branch. Thusly, few Branchwraiths think kindly of the Elves, and many hate them - it matters not that Durthu brought the Elves into the forest precisely because he knew that the Branchwraiths' cruel nature would lead Athel Loren to great evil. Now the Branchwraiths watch and wait for the seasons to shift once again. One day soon, they believe, the usurpers will be cast down from their lofty perches and the natural order restored.	false

To tread such paths, an Elf must be invisible not only to a predator’s sight but to his other senses also – no easy matter when contending with otherworldly creatures to whom Elven souls manifest as brightly burning lights. The Deepwood Scouts’ skills of stealth and concealment serve them well upon the battlefield. They are masters of ambush and distraction, the assassins of enemy artillery crews and of careless Wizards who stray too far from the protection of their allies. Indeed, many an invading army has been brought to battle utterly unaware that kinbands of Deepwood Scouts have dogged its footsteps for days. Only when battle lines clash do the Deepwood Scouts reveal themselves, sowing confusion and disruption among the enemy force.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh_dlc05_unit_long_text_wef_dryads	Dryads are spiteful creatures with hearts akin to shards of ice. In the soul of a Dryad, there is neither room nor regard for compassion or mercy, merely an uncompromising dedication to Athel Loren that makes even the most heartfelt vows of Elf or Man seem trivial by comparison. To harm the forest is to invoke a deadly and unyielding vengeance that ends only when the transgressor's body has been ruined and broken. Only a fool deliberately offers insult to a Dryad, but alas, these spirit-maids are so utterly different to mortal creatures that offence is often taken whether it was intended or not. Few mortals make such a mistake twice, and then only if the individual in question is either very lucky or very swift. 	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh_dlc05_unit_long_text_wef_durthu	Durthu is an Elder of Athel Loren, a Treeman so ancient that even Ariel's millennia-long existence pales in comparison. It was he who first forged a union between Elves and forest, and who argued with his fellow Elders that the binding be made permanent. In those days, he was ever a friend to the Children of Isha, always willing to help them broaden their understanding of forest and Weave. Alas, those days are long gone. Centuries of destruction and carnage have taken their toll on Durthu's valiant spirit. He bore witness to the rapacity of blooded life, and of the wanton destruction it has heaped upon his homeland. He has seen untold acres of trees felled for kindling or from simple spite. He has watched, time and again, as the Elves have invited calamity on the forest through an inability to sever their connection to the outside world. Worst of all, he has seen his fellow Elders fall, one by one; some slain by their own foes but most destroyed by the enemies of the Elves.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh_dlc05_unit_long_text_wef_eternal_guard	Through the long Winter months, the forest of Athel Loren is at its lowest ebb, made dormant and vulnerable by the cycle of the seasons. The Treemen slumber, and even the normally vigorous Dryads are sluggish and slow. During this time, guardianship of the most sacred of places falls to the Eternal Guard, sons and daughters of Athel Loren's noble houses. Each Eternal Guard is a formidable foe in her own right, trained to a pinnacle of skill that other races cannot easily match. When assembled in numbers, they form a phalanx, their spears thrusting and cutting with a graceful yet disciplined efficiency. The Eternal Guard themselves refer to such a place as a "fortress of boughs". They face the enemy with feet planted firmly upon their chosen ground, shields braced against attacks and the line of spears rippling as their leaf-shaped blades dart forward to kill.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh_dlc05_unit_long_text_wef_forest_dragon	Nothing dwells for long in Athel Loren without being changed, and the Forest Dragons are no exception. Like certain groups of Wood Elves, the Dragons have slowly become an extension of the forest's will to survive and prosper. Though still voracious predators, the Dragons hunt only when the forest has need of them, resting in a state of hibernation for the remainder of the time. Should there be an intrusion by creatures too mighty for Athel Loren's spirits, the forest will occasionally goad one or more Forest Dragons to wakefulness in order to counter the threat. More often, the Elves will themselves petition the aid of a Dragon to serve as a steed for a Glade Lord - a request that the beast cedes with reasonable grace, provided it wasn't disturbed from a particularly fascinating dream. Over time, a Glade Lord might form a strong bond with a particular Forest Dragon, the two becoming friends - more than mere allies at need.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh_dlc05_unit_long_text_wef_glade_guard	When Athel Loren goes to war, it is the Glade Guard who form the core of the army. Each Elven household fights together on the battlefield with disparate kinbands, combining to create one or more formal regiments under the command of a lesser Lord or Lady of the realm. The Wood Elf army can only seem haphazard and slightly disorganised to outsiders, for each band of Glade Guard is expected to follow the general's broad instructions but, at the same time, is encouraged to take the initiative when the opportunity presents itself. Such a principle often leads to an overlapping line of battle, with individual Glade Guard kinbands advancing and retreating like blown leaves in a storm, all the while pouring volleys of arrows into the foe.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh_dlc05_unit_long_text_wef_glade_lord	The lords and ladies of Athel Loren have ruled the Wood Elves for millennia. Each highborn is required to keep his domain free from intruders and has the ultimate responsibility over the area of the forest in which his followers dwell. Most often, this is a task that is accomplished by the Highborn's Eternal Guard and Glade Guard, though in more dangerous times, he or she will entreat the spirits of the forest, or even Elves from other regions of Athel Loren, to lend their aid. Though the inhabitants of Athel Loren are as proud as any of the Elven races, they never allow their own hubris to endanger their homeland. The defence of Athel Loren is the one calling that is held above all others. When Athel Loren goes to war, the nobles direct the efforts of its armies, often commanding a varied yet lethal assortment of Elves and forest spirits. In the summer months, when the forest is strong enough to defend itself against most threats, many are caught up in Orion's great hunt. Even so, there are always a handful of able war-leaders who remain within the borders of the wood, ready to defend their home to their dying breath.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh_dlc05_unit_long_text_wef_glade_riders	The Glade Riders are perhaps the greatest horse-warriors of the world, their Elven reflexes allowing them to perform an incredible variety of seemingly reckless acts that are far beyond the abilities of lesser races. Whether firing backwards while riding full pelt through deep woods or darting through the ranks of surprised enemy outriders, Glade Riders routinely survive their escapades unscathed through a formidable combination of graceful skill and unflappable confidence.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh_dlc05_unit_long_text_wef_great_eagle	There has always been a great bond of kinship between the Elves and the Great Eagles, stretching back to ancient times. That bond remains strong between the Wood Elves and the noble avians, and so many families of eagles choose to make their homes in the heights of the Grey Mountains, close by the borders of Athel Loren. On rare or desperate occasions, a Great Eagle may offer itself as a mount to a particularly trusted Glade Lord. This is a great honour in the eyes of the Wood Elves, for it is a true partnership of equals. Such a union forms the start of a great and enduring friendship that continues to bind both parties, even after death.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh_dlc05_unit_long_text_wef_hawk_riders	Many large birds of prey live in Athel Loren, especially where it covers the foothills, ravines and crags of the Grey Mountains. These hawks and shrikes grow to far grander proportions than similar species found elsewhere in the world, though why this should be remains a mystery. A fledging hawk raised by an Elf develops a powerful bond with its master, and will even bear him into battle. As time passes, rider and hawk become almost one creature, existing for the call of the Hunt and the thrill of the chase alone. These Warhawk Riders scout their territory for invaders, and are skilful enough to guide their steeds down through the trees to strike at intruders. Those who ride Warhawks display phenomenal agility and balance, able to launch volleys of arrows while their mounts flit and dart through the forest at speed. In this way, an intruder who strays into the Pine Crags and other mountainous realms faces not only the fury of the hawks, but also that of the Elves - as several Dwarf expeditions have found to their cost.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh_dlc05_unit_long_text_wef_orion	Orion is the King of Athel Loren. He is immortal, but his existence is irrevocably tied to the seasons. Thus does he pass willingly into his own funeral pyre each Midwinter, only to be reborn into thunderous life on the first day of Spring. Each year, on the eve of the vernal equinox, the Wild Riders select a young prince who will bear the mantle of Orion for the coming year. This chosen one is led to the Oak of Ages and given over to Ariel's keeping. There, she works the miracle of rebirth, sculpting her lost husband anew from the chosen one's flesh and Kurnous' spirit. On the following morning, the chosen one emerges from the Oak's embrace, a mortal Elf no longer, but reborn as Orion, god-king of Athel Loren.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh_dlc05_unit_long_text_wef_sisters_of_thorn	The Sisters of the Thorn are Ariel's handmaidens. In many ways, they are equal and opposite to the Wild Riders of Kurnous, a sisterhood pledged to sorcery and subtlety where Orion's equerries know loyalty only to the glory of the Hunt. Where the Wild Riders are borne into battle on steeds as reckless as they are, the Sisters ride the Steeds of Isha - mounts whose viciousness lies hidden beneath a graceful aspect. Just like their mistress, the Sisters of the Thorn are eternal; they seem never to age and succumb to injury only briefly. Should one be slain, her siblings place her body upon a bier of root and ivy and bear it away to the hallowed halls beneath the Oak of Ages. There she slumbers away the weeks and months until the arrival of a new Spring, where the riot of magic and life-energy restores her to vibrant existence. Only if her body is irretrievable or mutilated beyond all recognition does the fallen Sister's spirit flee the mortal world, leaving her bereaved siblings to exact vengeance on her slayer.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh_dlc05_unit_long_text_wef_spellsinger	Elves are intrinsically magical beings. In most, this talent is too weak to be developed, presenting itself as occasional forebodings, but in truly gifted Elves it can be shaped into a tool of great power. Such a boon is not without danger, for raw magic is a destructive thing if drawn upon unwisely. Whilst other Elves protect themselves from such ravages through ritual, the Spellweavers and Spellsingers of Athel Loren shield themselves by joining their minds to the forest's sleeping consciousness. Mages sometimes take to the field in pairs composed of one Highweaver and one Darkweaver. Whilst the Darkweaver unleashes flesh-shredding storms of sorcery, her Highweaver counterpart employs High Magic to bolster their allies. Yet the Highweaver has another duty - should the Darkweaver show signs of being overcome by the sorceries she wields, the Highweaver becalms the Winds of Magic, shutting off the flow of corrupting power, and thus holding the incipient madness at bay, at least for a while...	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh_dlc05_unit_long_text_wef_treekin	At the heart of every Tree Kin resides the soul of a dead Elf, though this is not the fate of all. Only the strongest and most driven souls retain enough individuality to become such creatures. Most, eager to renounce the identity and struggles that shaped their mortal lives, pass into the Weave of the forest. Though their family and friends might occasionally fancy that they can hear their loved one's voice upon the wind, it is but an echo of a life long abandoned. However, those souls that become Tree Kin are unable to completely abandon their grip on their former lives, and they forge themselves a new body out of dead timber so that they might continue to defend in death that which they loved in life.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh_dlc05_unit_long_text_wef_treemen	The most powerful of Athel Loren's spirits are able to entwine their essence with that of a living tree, moulding it to their will. It is not a decision taken lightly, for when a spirit forms a bond with a living tree, they become irrevocably merged and cannot choose to leave - only death can sever the connection. From that moment on, the will of the spirit shapes and drives the tree, using knotted bark and  gnarled branches to serve where an insubstantial spirit form cannot. Thus is a Treeman born. Certain to be counted amongst the mightiest of Athel Loren's denizens, his gnarled form is almost impervious to harm, and his strength a near-match for the Dragons of the deep glades. Treemen do not fight with grace or finesse, but with huge sweeping blows that strike home with enough force to shatter stone. They can stomp their knurled feet into the ground, knocking foes down, or even send writhing roots to drag foes deep underground where their tendrils can feast upon the flesh and bone.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh_dlc05_unit_long_text_wef_wardancers	Wardancers roam Athel Loren in tightly-knit troupes, treading paths and secret ways that few others know or dare use. Other Wood Elves regard the Wardancers as wild and unpredictable, and not without cause, for they are the servants and worshippers of the Elven Trickster God, Loec. The Wardancers lead the Elves in music and rejoicing, and perform the intricate dance rituals that re-enact the history of Athel Loren, a form of storytelling more important to the Wood Elves than the more conventional method of writing. Wardancers are sublime warriors, made even more deadly through their war dances. For these, the favoured rituals of the Trickster God, no rhythm is called nor are orders issued. Instead, the dancers instinctively enact a pattern of lethal movements, complementing the dances performed by the rest of the troupe. Each Wardancer leaps and pirouettes through the enemy ranks to music only she hears, gracefully evading her opponent's clumsy blows and ending his life with an impossibly swift strike of her own.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh_dlc05_unit_long_text_wef_waystalker	Waystalkers' personalities have become entirely submerged by their obsession with stalking prey. They are taciturn and solitary individuals, and they may let years pass between visits to the Wood Elf halls. Waystalkers are perfectly at ease within their forest homeland and effortlessly survive by their wits and cunning in the wilds. On the rare occasion when a Waystalker returns to the halls, he stands apart from all others, for he is closer to the forest than to other Elves. A Waystalker's marksmanship shames even that of other Waywatchers. He can pick out a single enemy from a seething mass of troops and place the one perfect shot that brings the target, lifeless, to the ground. Yet the Waystalker finds no reason to exult in the application of his skills - after all, what prey could hope to escape one who has dedicated his entire life to the hunter's art?	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh_dlc05_unit_long_text_wef_waywatchers	Waywatchers are silent sentinels, the guardians of the paths leading into Athel Loren. They are masters of concealment, and can lie unmoving and unnoticed for days on end before springing an ambush on a startled and unfortunate prey. Few warriors can match a Waywatcher's skill with a bow. Should they wish it, these silent stalkers can loose an unerring stream of black-shafted arrows in a heartbeat, or place a single shot precisely in the weak point of a foe's armour. Furthermore, Waywatchers are highly adept at the arts of disruption and surprise, often appearing silently next to a vulnerable enemy and vanishing as quickly before the body even hits the ground. Thus do any who enter Athel Loren run the risk of being slain without warning by the Waywatchers, cut down by unseen archers or falling prey to their cunningly-constructed traps.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh_dlc05_unit_long_text_wef_wild_riders	The Wild Riders of Kurnous are Orion's personal guard, each as aggressive and impulsive as he. They are fey and dangerous creatures who are no longer truly the Elves they once were. Now and forever, they are a part of the Wild Hunt's eternal glory. In appearance, Wild Riders are throwbacks to the ancient days of the Elves. Their weapons are things of crude iron, or even flint; their ceremonial robes and armour seldom more than the pelts of animals slain during their sacred hunts. Yet there is an otherworldliness and nobility about the Wild Riders that cannot easily be denied; the power of Kurnous flows through them as surely as it does through Orion.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh_dlc05_unit_long_text_wef_wildwood_rangers	Athel Loren is not a safe place, even for the Elves. Even now, thousands of years on from the first Great Council, there are those forest spirits who resent the Elves' presence, and visit upon them whatever cruelties are in their power. Banished to the sinister south-eastern corner of Athel Loren known as the Wildwood, these dark spirits rail against the Waystone fence that confines them and dream darkly of revenge on those who have occupied their home. The task of guarding the border between this shadowy prison and the rest of Athel Loren falls to the Wildwood Rangers. Theirs is an existence thoroughly at odds with the gaiety and splendour known by other Wood Elves, for just as the creatures of the Wildwood do not rest, nor can those who have sworn to keep them trammelled. The waystone fence is ever under attack, and it suffers disruption more often than any care to contemplate. Any breach, however small, brings with it the risk of carnage as the dark spirits slip loose from their bonds and wreak all manner of havoc in the forest beyond. The Rangers converge on such breaches within moments of their formation, holding back the tide of dark spirits long enough for Spellweavers to make the waystone barriers whole once again. Thus must the Rangers be ever-vigilant, so that their kinsfolk need not live in fear.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh_dlc06_unit_long_text_chs_aspiring_champions	The frozen north spawns some of the hardiest warriors in all the world. Each is a paragon of deadly ability and lethal intent. Some ascend to command entire nations, some pursue the esoteric paths of the arcane, but the majority dedicate themselves to little more than the brutal butchery of all who stand in their way. These ruthless killers are known as Exalted Heroes. The history of many Exalted Heroes, recorded in scattered chronicles by the free people of the Old World, is a catalogue of woes and evil deeds. Their infamy shines bright as they capture the notice of the Dark Gods of Chaos with ever-greater feats of slaughter. They frequently seek out others of their kind to engage in ritual combat. When two champions of Chaos clash, they duel to the death in the manner of gladiators, using the full force of every weapon at their disposal. When a victor emerges, bloodied but triumphant, he will cut a grisly trophy from his foe, claiming both his vanquished enemy's weapons and followers as his own. If the triumphant champion has truly excelled, he may even succeed in attracting the attention of the Dark Gods and, in doing so, receive a more permanent reward for his deeds in the form of a mutation of Daemonic gift. With each victory, he grows ever closer to becoming a Chaos Lord, with whole armies to command and Daemonhood within his reach.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh_dlc06_unit_long_text_chs_marauder_horsemasters	Some tribes of Marauders hold horses in high esteem, while others regard them with fear and superstition. To many, a warhorse is a sign of status, and only the best warriors may ride them. The steeds ridden by these tribes are powerful beasts, foul-tempered and strong of limb. Once a rider has broken such a horse, it will remain loyal to him until death, but they remain vicious and unruly should a stranger approach. Fed on a diet of human flesh and watered-down blood, these snorting, high-spirited steeds have a glint of intelligent menace in their eyes, and will trample, kick and bite as if berserk when engaged at close quarters. In battle, their speed and mobility leaves even the most able cavalrymen of the Old World sorely lacking. Able to steer their steeds with the subtlest of movements of the waist and knees, the tribesmen have both hands free to wield wicked blades and hooked axes.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh_dlc07_unit_long_text_brt_battle_pilgrims	Wherever the Grail Knights travel, they gather a trail of fanatical worshippers whose only goal in life is to bask in the reflected glory of these mighty individuals. Driven by relentless obsession, these devout followers collect almost anything that a Grail Knight casts away, whether it be scraps of ruined armour, clothing, or even discarded food. Such is their burning passion, these religious scavengers will follow their idol through all weathers and lands, exulting in his acts and praising his sparing words. The Knights bear these followers with a dutiful resignation that borders on the stoic, though they endeavour not to encourage their self-appointed apostles. This is a vain hope, for even the merest word or gesture is seized upon as an act of great import and eagerly immortalised in tales and discordant song. If a Grail Knight is unfortunate enough to fall in battle, his devoted followers will swarm over this corpse, picking it clean of anything that could bear the Blessing of the Lady.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh_dlc07_unit_long_text_brt_fay_enchantress	A figure of awe and inspiration, the Fay Enchantress is the personal representation of the Lady of the Lake, and as such is the most influential figure in all of Bretonnia. Her will is that of the goddess, and even kings of Bretonnia must bow to her wise counsel. The Grail Knights, having sworn their lives completely to the Lady, are bound by their sacred oaths to respond to any call or decree the Fay Enchantress makes. Their vows ensure that this duty is paramount, coming even before the loyalty to duke and king, for the Lady and the Enchantress represent the land of Bretonnia more so than any mortal Lord ever could. At times when the king has no clear heir, the Fay Enchantress alone has the power to instate a worthy replacement. Evidence of the Fay Enchantress' power over Bretonnian realms can most forcefully be seen during the time of King Ballaume the Brave, when she ordered the Grail Knights of the king's own court to forcefully expel him, stripping him of his title and honour before banishing him and installing his successor.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh_dlc07_unit_long_text_brt_foot_squires	Serving their Knightly masters in both times of peace and war, Squires are effectively errand boys for their Lord, fulfilling menial or unsavoury tasks that their masters would prefer to delegate. Yet in battle, they fight with every ounce of skill and ferocity that their training has given them, using their two-handed blades to cleave through all foes in the name of the Lady, Bretonnia, and their Lord’s glory. For a Squire, every battle is a chance to perform some great deed or service to his master; it is his only chance – albeit a miniscule one – to be elevated to Knighthood.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh_dlc07_unit_long_text_brt_grail_reliquae	Many bands of pilgrims cart around a Grail Reliquae wherever they go, the corpse of a departed Knight resting at its centre. A Reliquae's exterior is a gaudy melange, adorned with trinkets gathered from many Grail Knights from across all corners of the realm. The pilgrims devote themselves to this makeshift, portable shrine, supplicating themselves before it as if it were a living Grail Knight, praying for its blessing. To pilgrims, the Reliquae is the ultimate icon of their devotion to both the Lady of the Lake and her Knights, from which the chosen amongst them can preach their creed. There is never a shortage of listeners for these demagogues either, for at each town or village the common people flock to the Reliquae so that they might hear, in graphic detail, the latest tales and deeds of the heroic Knight who unintentionally leads the procession.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh_dlc07_unit_long_text_brt_green_knight	The Green Knight is a well-known figure of Bretonnian folklore, stories and poems about him being amongst the most popular in the kingdom. A common character in puppet shows and plays performed for peasants and kings like, the Knight is bedecked in strange, ivy-covered armour and intones his famous line "None shall pass!". The traditional nemesis of the valiant Questing Knights of these tales, the Green Knight challenges them to duels so that they might prove their worth to the Lady, and thus sup from the blessed Grail. However, most folk do not realise that these stories are bound in fact; the Green Knight is the sacred protector of Bretonnia, and his spirit-essence is intertwined with the land and the Lady of the Lake herself. He has appeared to many Questing Knights throughout history, who subsequently spoke of the sky clouding over with the darkness of twilight and a green mist seeping from the earth, slowly taking the shape of a figure riding a snorting steed. Then the Green Knight appears, brandishing a glowing blade, his eyes ablaze with fay light!	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh_dlc07_unit_long_text_brt_knights_errant	All noble sons of the realm are committed to the path of Knighthood from the moment they are born. Though birth into nobility guarantees his place, a young noble is not honoured until he has proven his worth. Some earn status through faithful service to their Lords, others through powerful connections and family ties, but the most glorious and only true way for a young Knight to fulfil his calling is to test himself against the foe on the field of battle. Eager to prove his skill, and thus attain status and renown, a Knight Errant is bold and enthusiastic to the point of recklessness - a trait that common folk idolise and admire. On the battlefield he is impetuous, eager to earn fame and honour in the thick of the fight. He charges boldly into the fray, heedless of danger and desiring glory, even if it means his own death. Older, more experienced Knights rarely discourage this, as it is both a way of pruning the ranks and a suitable outlet for the enthusiasm of youth. None would deny a young Knight his destiny - those whose skill and bravery are proven will go on to become Knights of the Realm.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh_dlc07_unit_long_text_brt_prophetess	Damsels and Prophetesses are powerful individuals, for in their years away from Bretonnia, their innate abilities have been honed and tempered. Their magic is orientated around nature more so than most other human Wizards, for they are taught by the handmaidens of the Lady. Riding into battle, Damsels and Prophetesses use their powers to lend magical protection to Bretonnia's noble warriors, warding away the foul magic of their enemies as well as casting them down with powerful spells of their own. They are also able to mystically encourage the landscape to fight the kingdom's enemies; persuading the trees themselves to lash out at the foe; calling flocks of birds to descend on the enemy at their call; even drawing lightning from the heavens to strike down in devastating arcs.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh_dlc07_unit_long_text_brt_questing_knights	Since the days of Giles the Uniter, the Holy Grail has been the ultimate symbol of Bretonnian chivalry, and the ultimate goal of any true Knight has been to find it. He who begins the quest for the Grail relinquishes all his worldly possessions and all ties to his domain. Setting aside his lance, he instates another Knight to fulfil his duties of administration and protection prior to setting out upon the quest. The following months and years of the Questing Knight's life are filled with trials and hardships that strengthen his mind, body and soul. His path is a winding one, for he is pledged to never sleep two nights in the same place and never to yield in his search whilst he continues to draw breath.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh_dlc08_unit_long_text_nor_feral_mammoth	Roaming across the frozen north are the woolly colossuses of the Old World – the gargantuan Feral Mammoths. With their elephantine trunks and great curved tusks, they are not unlike living mountains, feeding off the thorny barrens and causing the ground to quake as they follow their endless migration paths. The Northmen frequently seek them out as abandoned calves, for if a mammoth is trained early enough, it can be brought into battle as a highly effective trampling weapon that can easily reduce enemies to bloody ground-smears. Exposure to Chaos-tainted materials has resulted in some of the species mutating into larger and more aggressive versions of the regular feral variety, sometimes sprouting extra horns that make them desirable to be ridden into battle as War Mammoths.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh_dlc08_unit_long_text_nor_fimir_balefiend	A millennia ago, amphibious humanoids known as the Fimir were favoured by the Chaos Gods. Then, as the Gods turned their attentions to the more vibrant and amusing race of man, the Fimir were abandoned. Having since existed in reclusion, they now have a common cause with the Norscan tribes, doing the bidding of the Ruinous Powers as way of regaining their favour. Their mysterious Balefiends wield a powerful magic that appears crude and ritualistic to outsiders, but is incredibly potent. They spend prolonged periods away from the swamps, harvesting power from daemons to destabilise the barrier between the mortal world and the Realm of Chaos.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh_dlc08_unit_long_text_nor_fimir_warriors	With a single eye atop a fanged snout, and deathly yellow-grey flesh that can shrug off blows that would kill a mortal man outright, the amphibious humanoid monsters known as the Fimir are horrific living legends. Their origins are unknown to most, but a millennium ago they were roaring the praises of the Dark Gods as they despoiled the lands of men living in the area that would later become the Empire. Then, one day, the Gods abandoned them in favour of man. Despite hating mankind, the Fimir have a common cause with the Norscan tribes, as they both crave the attention of the Dark Gods, but even so, it is an uneasy and fractious alliance.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh_dlc08_unit_long_text_nor_frost_wyrm	The mutating power of Chaos has touched more than just Trolls and Wolves in the malign wilderness of Troll Country. In its northern reaches, just below the surface of the frozen tundra, Chaos Frost Dragons lurk in their underground lairs. With the appearance of giant, winged monsters, nobody is entirely sure of their true nature or origins, but they are certainly abominable creatures tainted by Chaos. Lying motionless beneath the frozen tundra, the cold-blooded Chaos Frost Dragon waits for the footfalls of trespassers before emerging to freeze them to death in their tracks.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh_dlc08_unit_long_text_nor_marauder_berserkers	Marauder Berserkers are driven by one thing alone; a lethal intent to inflict unparalleled brutality upon their enemies. Like all Marauders, they are unrelenting combatants who habitually take what their own lands cannot provide from lesser men, but are set apart by their bizarre pre-battle rituals and unequalled fanaticism for killing. They immerse themselves in a psychotic state of mind before a fight, always consuming vast quantities of beer and indulging in head-butting contests prior to entering the battlefield. Once they see their enemies they attack without regard for their own lives, wild-eyed and frothing at the mouth. Upon reaching their target, the Berserker turns into a human whirlwind – with an axe in each hand, he spins, chops, and dismembers with a strength only achievable by a madman.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh_dlc08_unit_long_text_nor_marauder_champions	In the eyes of the Northmen, there is a natural distinction between the mass of roving warriors, and the favoured few. The ultimate ambition of a Marauder is to die fighting under the gaze of the Dark Gods, or otherwise become worthy and powerful enough to travel to the far north to face their judgement directly. Individuals strong enough to walk that path emerge only occasionally: Marauder Champions, who fight and kill with more skill and ferocity than their brethren, and so gain a higher status in their warrior hierarchies. The otherworldly rewards are not always clear, however – these standout fighters epitomise both the glory and the risk of seeking the attention of the Dark Gods, treading along a knife’s edge between immortality and oblivion.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh_dlc08_unit_long_text_nor_marauder_chariot	Marauders are natural fighters, born into hardship and brought up in a world where surviving each day is no small victory. When they take to their war chariots, they fight with even more ruthlessness and fervour for the Dark Gods, slamming into enemy lines with bone-shattering speed, hurling enemies in all directions from the sheer force of the impact. The chariots utilised by the Marauders are similar to those used by the Warriors of Chaos, pulled by hellish steeds, with spinning scythes forged to their wheels, and a spike-covered chassis to cause maximum bloodshed in a charge. The weapon of choice for the Marauder charioteers is the mighty halberd, providing ample damage output when the chariot is forced into close-up combat situations.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh_dlc08_unit_long_text_nor_marauder_hunters	The ruthless martial societies of the northern tribes see many men cast out into the wastes due to some transgression or another against their clan. An unforgiving way of life means that it is often impossible for these men to re-assimilate themselves into the warrior hierarchy. The few exiles that avoid death out in the freezing tundra often come together to form bloodthirsty bands of wild hunters, etching out a brutal existence that makes them even more hardened, callous, and adept as warriors – Marauders with the skill of ambush hunters. Attaining such skills is a way back into the battle ranks: when larger forces of tribesmen come together, the Marauder Hunters’ terrifyingly efficient ambushes frequently mark the beginning of their raids.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh_dlc08_unit_long_text_nor_marauder_warwolves	As with all creatures of the Old World, the further north one goes, the more likely an encounter with a beast touched by the mutations of the Ruinous Powers. Marauder Warwolves are one such afflicted beast – like their Warhound cousins, the Warwolf mutation is the result of exposure to the energies of Chaos deep in the malign wilderness of Troll Country where they originate, enabling them to freeze foes in their stride with only their icy breath. Woe betide any unfortunate soul who strays into the Warwolves' territory, who will likely hear their mournful howls before being hunted, frozen, and devoured.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh_dlc08_unit_long_text_nor_marauder_warwolves_chariot	The Marauder Warwolves Chariot is an interesting take on the standard war chariots commonly used by the Northmen and other Warriors of Chaos. The same spike-laden chassis gives it a similarly devastating impact on the charge, but instead of being pulled by destriers, it is pulled by brutish Warwolves. This gives the chariot several advantages – firstly, the swift, muscle-built beasts enable the chariot to move faster over short distances. Also, unlike horses, Warwolves are natural killers in their own right – bloodthirsty animals concerned only with biting and tearing at enemy flesh. This makes the Warwolves Chariot a truly scary prospect up close; snapping, slobbering jaws await any who engage the charioteers in melee.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh_dlc08_unit_long_text_nor_marauders	Marauders are natural fighters, born into hardship and brought up in a world where surviving each day is no small victory. Only the strong and capable prosper, for the weak are weeded out and killed. They have no time for plough or sickle, for their tools are the axe, the sword and the shield. What their own lands cannot provide, they simply take from the lands of lesser men. The Chieftains that lead these warriors are a daunting sight, brooding hulks of muscle and hair whose bodies are covered in the scars and trophies of battle. Bearing weapons worn from dealing a thousand mortal injuries to those foolish enough to face them, these savage leaders are independent and fierce. These battle-hardened killers are the products of a people so steeped in conflict that, even in times of prosperity, they will fight to the death for the honour of leading the next raid. 	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh_dlc08_unit_long_text_nor_norscan_giant	Giants are monstrous humanoids with a prodigious appetite for violence. They are single-minded engines of destruction most often encountered in the far north of the world, being fond of the cold, rocky climes. Many find themselves lumbering alongside the warring Northman tribes, either for their fill of fresh meat and strong alcohol, or simply for the promise of slaughter and battle. Many Giants of the north are instinctively drawn to the raiding men who seek to bear the favour of the Dark Gods – perhaps because the corpses are always thick on the ground in the company of such individuals. Smashing into enemy ranks to kill and feed, they have no real concept of obeying orders but, rather importantly, do have the intelligence to recognise friend from foe.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh_dlc08_unit_long_text_nor_norscan_ice_trolls	Ice Trolls originate further north than their counterparts from Troll Country. All Trolls have indiscriminate appetites and unthinking ferocity, and the northern variety are no different. With their great strength and regenerative abilities, the warlike Northmen find uses for Trolls in battle, despite them having rather limited intelligence. Most varieties are able to spew acidic stomach bile over their victims to inflict a nasty death, but the Ice Trolls’ proximity to the Chaos Wastes has caused this ability to mutate into something else altogether. With a single exhalation of their icy breath, they can instantly freeze their foes in their tracks, usually just before gobbling them up in a crunch of icy flesh and bones.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh_dlc08_unit_long_text_nor_shaman_sorcerer	The Shaman-Sorcerer is, more often than not, a practiced murderer. He pursues dark pacts and bargains with numerous petty Chaos godlings and daemons as the source of his arcane powers, and uses his prophetic influence to guide the tribes towards war. Shaman Sorcerers are rightly feared due to their prophetic seer-craft and unholy mastery of the stormy Winds of the frozen north, conducting Daemonic rituals as a way of gaining favour from the Dark Gods. That is not to say they are incapable of face-to-face combat – they take to the battlefield with both staff and axe, wielding magic as well as cutting down any unfortunate foe who happens to get too close.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh_dlc08_unit_long_text_nor_skin_wolf_werekin	Werekin are former champions afflicted by feral mutations, whom the Gods deem not yet worthy to join them as immortals. Although feared by the local tribes where they dwell, they are not hated and indeed, they are respected. For the Northmen believe that even those cast down have been chosen, and it is better to be chosen than to live your whole life beyond the sight of the Gods. Werekin are much larger and more distorted in body than the lesser Skin Wolves, living in caves deep within the frozen wastes. In times when they are not being brought to war by the raiding tribes, they feed on offerings from the locals, or otherwise devour unknowing passers-by who happen to carelessly dwell too near to their dens.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh_dlc08_unit_long_text_nor_skin_wolves	Many are the dark horrors of twisted flesh and nightmares made real that the Ruinous Powers have visited upon the world; few though are as strange as the Skin Wolves. Witch-cursed and Chaos-tainted, these creatures are half-feral and subject to savage appetites. They were previously men and women who carried within them the tainted blood of the mutated beast, which was somehow unleashed. Half-insane with insatiable hunger, a Skin Wolf has shredded flaps of skin and chunks of bloody gristle clinging to it, left behind by the unfortunate individual who the fully-formed humanoid wolf-thing ripped itself from. It is these clinging shrouds of skin that give the beasts their common name. 	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh_dlc08_unit_long_text_nor_throgg	At the heart of an icy labyrinth, in an area of Troll Country strewn with the gnawed corpses of once-mighty heroes, sits the Troll King, Throgg. With the filth-encrusted heirlooms of eaten warriors decorating his yellowed tusks, he strikes out from his wind-whipped wasteland home to ambush, despoil, and feast. On his heels follows the bitter cold of winter, and his subjects - stinking monsters, drooling mutants, and tormented madmen. The slaughter he leaves in his Wintry wake has earned him such infamy that every season, great and lauded heroes ride northwards to attempt to slay him – and every season, the Troll King dines on their flesh. Disenchanted with these incessant, petty challenges, Throgg vows to bring about an age of ice and darkness and make all races of the Old World his slaves.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh_dlc08_unit_long_text_nor_war_mammoth	Very few beasts have suffered more terrifyingly apt mutations for the purposes of battle than the War Mammoth. Granting them extra tusks and a greater size, their affliction also causes them to be violently aggressive. The Northmen consider them sacred because they go where they will, and destroy what they will – living totems of might and power. Training such a tainted beast to be ridden in battle is not an easy undertaking, and in some cases has to be facilitated by secretive shamanic rituals. Once a War Mammoth is brought under control, warriors fight from its back atop a fortified wooden platform, or otherwise the creatures are made to carry the mighty war-altars of the Chaos Gods onto the battlefield, held aloft and inviolable for all below to see.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh_dlc08_unit_long_text_nor_wulfrik	Wulfrik the Wanderer is one of the most devout worshippers of the Ruinous Powers to have ever journeyed across the world. With a hulking frame and tremendous skill at arms, his curse is to perpetually seek out the mightiest champions to duel – be they living, dead, mortal, or daemonic. His loyal warriors willingly sail to the corners of the world with him, raiding by his side as he takes the heads of all who dare cross his path. It is said that once Wulfrik has decided upon his next quarry, it is impossible to escape – such is his dutiful willingness to provide the murderous offerings due to the nefarious Dark Gods.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh_main_emp_cav_empire_knights	The noble-born warriors of the Empire do not form part of any state’s standing army, for to do so would mean to rub shoulders with the common soldiery. Instead, they typically fight as esteemed Knights; heroic warriors who ride into battle atop mighty barded warhorses. The Empire’s Knights are magnificent figures, clad in gleaming suits of heavy plate armour and armed with weapons of the finest quality. The sight of a regiment of Knights charging full tilt at the enemy is a terrifying prospect for the Empire’s foes to face. As they thunder onwards, they are likened to an avalanche of steel and muscle, and those enemies not spitted on the end of sharpened lances are crushed beneath the trampling of iron-shod hooves.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh_main_unit_long_text_brt_alberic_of_bordeleaux	Upon Alberic's tunic is proudly displayed the crest of Bordeleaux - the tri-forked Trident of Manann, God of the Waves and Storms. Like Manann, Alberic of Bordeleaux is tempestuous as the sea; as relentless as the tide. He is strict and courageous, hailing from a long line of powerful dukes who have led Bordeleaux, with the patience of the unremitting ocean, to security and prosperity; Alberic intends to be no different. Much like the waves that crash endlessly against the Bretonnian shore, so too does Alberic never cease. Whilst many do not see his progress, it is affected slowly but with the inevitability of nature.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh_main_unit_long_text_brt_blessed_field_trebuchet	The first Bretonnian trebuchet is believed to have been constructed in the small village of Lyonesse. It is said that an eccentric bastard child, a pious young man prone to fits and visions, built the war machine in a single night of feverish activity, using parts of the crumbling Grail Chapel of Adelhard the Second, as well as pieces scrounged from various other sources. When the village was attacked by northern raiders, it was this construction that fended them off, firing massive chunks of masonry to sink the marauders' longships. The young man was later presented to the king, and his designs copied and improved upon. For saving the village and maintaining the purity of the Grail Chapel (though it was now even more ruined than before), the young man was gifted with a fatted pig and two copper crowns - more wealth than he could have hoped to see in a lifetime.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh_main_unit_long_text_brt_damsel	Damsels and Prophetesses are powerful individuals, for in their years away from Bretonnia, their innate abilities have been honed and tempered. Their magic is orientated around nature more so than most other human Wizards, for they are taught by the handmaidens of the Lady. Riding into battle, Damsels and Prophetesses use their powers to lend magical protection to Bretonnia's noble warriors, warding away the foul magic of their enemies as well as casting them down with powerful spells of their own. They are also able to mystically encourage the landscape to fight the kingdom's enemies; persuading the trees themselves to lash out at the foe; calling flocks of birds to descend on the enemy at their call; even drawing lightning from the heavens to strike down in devastating arcs.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh_main_unit_long_text_brt_field_trebuchet	The Field Trebuchet is an essential piece of equipment when the Bretonnians engage in siege warfare, and smaller versions of these machines are sometimes deployed on the field of battle. Indeed, since the king himself commissioned a number to be built with which to defend Couronne, their popularity has increased. Still, Knights tend to put on a show of disdain towards siege engines - some refusing to use them at all. Nevertheless, it is a sign of particular opulence to be in possession of a Trebuchet, for they are time consuming to create and are individually hand-crafted. There are only a finite number within Bretonnia with the skill to create them, and their services are highly sought after. Although a Knight would never stoop so low as to operate a missile weapon himself, let alone a war machine, he could grudgingly see their strategic worth and allow his low-born servants to use them - for being peasants they don’t understand the concept of honour anyway!	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh_main_unit_long_text_brt_grail_guardians	The Fay Enchantress is one of the most revered and respected figures in all of Bretonnia. As is fitting of someone who speaks with the voice of the Lady, she is accompanied at all times by a retinue of Knights who defend her to the death. These men, selected from the very best of the Grail Knights, are warriors par excellence, striking down the enemies of Bretonnia with shining blades of justice. Though rumours abound that the Fay Enchantress is none other than the Lady herself, and therefore requiring no earthly protectors, the Grail Guardians care not and defend their charge all the same.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh_main_unit_long_text_brt_grail_knights	Only when a Questing Knight has proved his valour and purity beyond all doubt does the Lady of the Lake appear to him in a vision, rewarding him not only with the sight of the Grail, but also permitting him to drink from it. Few indeed are allowed to sup from this, the holiest of Bretonnian artefacts, and only those Knights of unblemished purity survive a taste of the blessed waters from the chalice. Those who drink from the mystical chalice are changed forever, granted lifespans many times that of normal men, as well as other, stranger gifts. From that moment on they are irrevocably committed to the service of the Lady and the Grail, a bond that can only be broken by death. To the commoners of Bretonnia, Grail Knights form a pantheon of living deities, their names spoken as a reverent mantra throughout the land, and are often worshipped in their own right. They are tireless, and know neither fear, hardship nor despair, their words and deeds immortalised forever. Some five centuries since his death, many still recount how the eyes of Riquiard of Brascard glowed with a terrible light as he slew the enemies of the Lady, while others speak of a golden aura that protects all Grail Knights from harm. Amongst the most famous of all, Laudyricus of Couronne, was believed to have been possessed of a heart so pure and noble that he was anathema to all unclean creatures and could slay them with his merest touch.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh_main_unit_long_text_brt_knights_of_the_realm	Once a Knight Errant has proved himself worthy of his station, he is confirmed as a Knight of the Realm. Knights of the Realm make up the bulk of the nobility of Bretonnia and command great respect both for their station and for the deeds they have performed to reach it. Upon his investiture, a Knight is given the responsibility of administrating a domain – generally a few acres of land, a village and a castle. As the common folk in the domain are bound to his service, to work his land and pay their taxes, so too does the Knight swear fealty to the higher orders of nobility. A Knight of the Realm is duty-bound to defend his people and his land until death. As a noble trained in the arts of battle, he is expected to defend himself and his domain against minor threats without assistance from others. If the situation is more desperate, the Knight may either marshal the peasants of the village to fight with him, or instead shelter the commoners in his castle until help arrives from neighbouring domains. Above all, he is required to maintain the standards of Knightly honour, obeying the strict tenets of Bretonnian chivalry. Amongst the most important of these is to respond to the call to war, when a Knight will fight alongside his peers, not as a rite of passage, but as duty required by his station. There is no greater shame than to fail in these responsibilities, thus betraying the chivalric code. If he does so, he may be stripped of all titles and rights, and be banished from the realm until he can prove himself once more.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh_main_unit_long_text_brt_lord	Bretonnian Lords are powerful nobles whose deeds are recounted throughout the land, even by mighty earls, barons and the dukes themselves. Proud and powerful warriors all, Bretonnian Lords are excellent warrior-generals. Most of the Lords of Bretonnia were dukes of noble stock, such as Duke Behemond "Beastslayer" of Bastonne, and Theodoric of Brionne. They claim shared ancestry with the first Bretonnian king, Gilles le Breton, and many purport that their founders fought alongside him in his many battles. Lords are important and powerful figures both in the military and political world of Bretonnia, often trading sword and shield for cup and words in the halls of power; to play the game and advance their cause.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh_main_unit_long_text_brt_louen_leoncoeur	Louen Leoncoeur is the greatest leader of the Bretonnians since Gilles the Uniter. A mighty warrior-king, his subjects know well that he is the pinnacle of Knightly perfection and honour. Highly skilled on the field of battle and a master of tactics and strategy, Louen has never known defeat. Commoners and nobles alike speak his name with the same reverence, likening Louen to the mighty Companions of Gilles from ages past; some even say that the blood of Gilles runs in his veins. As ferocious yet honourable in diplomacy as he is in war, King Louen the "Lionhearted" is renowned far beyond the borders and Bretonnia itself, and respected by all. After more than twenty glorious years on the throne, Louen still appears to be in the prime of his life, though scholars whisper that he is close to his ninetieth year. It is said that he intends to turn his attentions to cursed Mousillon, cleansing it of taint and restoring its former glory. If Louen does this, the lands of Bretonnia will be united under his banner once and for all.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh_main_unit_long_text_brt_men_at_arms	Each Midsummer, commoners flock to their Lord's castle to present their sons in the hope that they will be trained as Men-at-Arms. For a peasant to have a son accepted into the ranks of a Knight's household is a great honour. Some young peasants will have been guided towards this goal through their entire life, encouraged to stand up straighter and taller than the usual peasant 'slouch' to better improve their chances of selection. All morning and afternoon the Knight inspects the candidates. By dusk, the luckiest and strongest are selected and are taken back to the castle where they are given basic training and outfitted in the livery of their Lord.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh_main_unit_long_text_brt_mounted_yeomen	As they hold such privileged positions as head gaolers and militia sergeants, to become a Yeoman is the highest rank to which a peasant can aspire. It takes many years of dedicated service for Men-at-Arms to be so promoted, and even then only an act of bravery on the battlefield will guarantee ascension. Though no peasant may ride the steeds of the Bretonnian Lords, favoured Yeomen are permitted to ride to battle on draught horses. Such troops will often scout ahead of the main army and keep the Knights informed of enemy movements – a dangerous task, and one which earns no honour, so it is a task that the nobility believe is best performed by peasants. All Men-at-Arms dream of one day becoming a Yeoman, possibly because of the folk stories that tell of Yeomen being raised to Knighthood after performing a great service or some brave deed. The truth is that it is almost unheard of for a peasant to be elevated in this way – the nobility have no wish to sully their ranks with low-born commoners.	false

unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh_main_unit_long_text_brt_paladin	Paladins are powerful heroes renowned through Bretonnia for their chivalry and feats of arms. Many of them are high-ranking nobles, holding titles such as earl or baron, while others hold warrior titles like marshal or warden. Paladins are powerful fighters, and make good leaders for units of Knights. Most Paladins are elite Grail Knights, having supped of the Lady's cup and attained everlasting life. Their courage, valour and loyalty are beyond reproach, and they defend the palaces of the Lady to the death. Considered by the people as paragons of society, Paladins attract crowds when they visit, held aloft by all as the very pinnacle of Bretonnian chivalry and brilliance.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh_main_unit_long_text_brt_peasant_bowmen	Although they speak their vows of duty, the peasants of Bretonnia do not understand. It is not their business to understand or to think - only to do. They do not know why they are summoned to fight - these things being beyond their regard - yet when the Greenskin hordes are bearing down upon them, low-born men know they must fight or die. Sometimes they are fortunate enough to be armed with rudimentary weapons; bows, with arrows drenched in oil and lit, or dipped in diseased buboes. Unlike Men-At-Arms, Peasant Bowmen are not equipped from the armouries of the castle and so their longbows will often be their own possessions, handed down from father to son and, accordingly, are of variable quality. Peasants who survive a battle may think themselves lucky until they too are stricken by fatal pox, mayhaps from a cut received whilst loading their unfamiliar and cumbersome weapons!	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh_main_unit_long_text_brt_peasant_mob	The life of a Bretonnian peasant is thankless, impoverished and - if the gods are merciful - short. Yet it is their duty to labour for, pay tribute to, and die in service of their Liege. Yet although a life spent toiling the land for pitiful gain is a damnable existence, it pales next to a day upon the battlefield. And indeed, should a duke ride to war, he will surely drag his droves of human chattel along with him. These hapless wanderers are then assuredly butchered in their multitudes as fodder to their Lord's worthy cause. To make their numbers count, peasants are ordered into huddled units on the battlefield, which makes up for their lack of training and skill. Like Men-At-Arms, Peasant Mobs are not very reliable if left to their own devices, but under the stern gaze of a Knight can aspire to adequate, though not exceptional, deeds.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh_main_unit_long_text_brt_pegasus_knights	Most Pegasus Knights hail from around the border city of Parravon, hard on the slopes of the Grey Mountains where many of their noble mounts can be found. Their numbers are made up almost exclusively of Knights of the Realm, and then only the richest and most influential can boast of owning a battle-trained pegasus, for the creatures are difficult to capture and harder still to train. Accordingly, to own such a beast is the ultimate symbol of wealth and success for their owners, but in truth a pegasus is also a great practical boon for any Knight fortunate enough to acquire one. A pegasus is stronger and faster than even the mightiest warhorse, easily able to crush a man’s skull with its flailing hooves and cover great distances swiftly. Indeed, in the more wild and inaccessible domains of Bretonnia, there is real merit to a steed that is not prone to becoming mired in mud or entangled in thorns. On the battlefield, small groups of Pegasus Knights will group together, often outstripping the rest of the army as they search for honourable combat.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh_main_unit_long_text_brt_royal_hippogryph_knights	Taming a hippogryph presents a challenge that many Bretonnian Lords cannot turn down, and this has made them into much sought after steeds. To successfully do so, the animal must be captured and broken at a very young age but, given the relentless territorialism of adult hippogryphs, acquiring a chick or an egg can prove a dangerous proposition indeed. Occasionally, the task of appropriating such a beast is given to a Knight Errant as a way of proving himself. More often, a duke will find suitable 'volunteers' from among the peasantry, promising a huge reward to any survivors that return with a healthy, young hippogryph.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh_main_unit_long_text_brt_royal_pegasus_knights	Only the richest and most powerful nobles own a Royal pegasus, for they are incredibly rare. Those fortunate enough treat theirs with the greatest respect, almost as if it were a peer. Each Lord has a handful of Knights Errant in his retinue whose responsibility it is to care for this, his prized possession and noblest of steeds. Peasants are never allowed near these beasts, lest their stench or clumsiness causes the pegasus harm - indeed, tales tell of the obsessive Volstall of Quenelles, who executed any peasant that even gazed upon his steed.	false

unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh_main_unit_long_text_chs_archaon	Archaon is the Lord of the End Times, the vessel through which the Dark Gods will unite their followers and turn the whole world into a Realm of Chaos. He is an individual whom all the Chaos Gods have bestowed their gifts upon. Of all the Everchosen of Chaos who have assailed the world over the ages, Archaon is the most ruthless and powerful. At the heart of Archaon's army is his old warband, the Swords of Chaos, the most dread group of Chaos Knights ever to have blighted the world. The Everchosen often rides to war leading this cadre of veterans from atop the daemonic beast known as Dorghar, the Steed of the Apocalypse.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh_main_unit_long_text_chs_chaos_chariot	Chaos Chariots are drawn by a pair of huge destriers swollen to unnatural size by the corrupting energies of Chaos. Each of these beasts is clad in tempered steel plates in the manner of their unholy masters. As these deadly creatures gain momentum, balefire flickers from their eyes and nostrils, giving the impression that the chariot has galloped straight from the realm of nightmares into reality. When a Chaos Chariot slams into the enemy lines, the bone-splintering impact is only the start of the carnage it can wreak. As the enemy is hurled in all directions by the sheer force of the chariot's charge, the hellish steeds plough through the enemy ranks, iron-shod hooves trampling bodies, and fanged maws snapping at exposed flesh. Spinning scythes slice apart the legs of those who attempt to flank the chariot, and the barbs and spikes that cover its chassis rip and tear at any foolhardily enough to stand their ground. But the chariot's cargo is just as deadly: the charioteers stab and slash from their fighting platform, maiming and decapitating those nearby with their cruel blades and spiked whips.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh_main_unit_long_text_chs_chaos_giant	Chaos Giants are monstrous humanoids with a prodigious appetite for violence. They are single-minded engines of destruction, as dedicated to murder and mayhem as champions of Chaos themselves. Chaos Giants are most often encountered in the far north of the world, being fond of the cold, rocky climes, and many find themselves in service to a warband, either for their fill of fresh meat and strong alcohol, or for the promise of slaughter and battle. A swearing, bellowing monstrosity that revels in displays of immense strength, a Chaos Giant is only content when it is crushing people beneath its enormous cloven hooves or smashing a battle line apart single-handedly. No wonder these creatures are favoured by the Chaos Gods, for they are annihilation incarnate. Chaos Giants are instinctively drawn to those who bear the favour of the Dark Gods, perhaps because the corpses are always thick on the ground in the company of such individuals. A Chaos Giant has the intelligence to recognise friend from foe, but little else, and it certainly has no real concept of obeying the orders of anything smaller than itself. Things such as tactics and strategy just confuse a Giant, who goes to battle primarily to kill and to feed. When a Chaos Giant has ploughed into the enemy ranks, it is as likely to grab a foe and store him somewhere for a later meal as it is to lay about itself with a jagged menhir or massive blade-studded tree trunk. Regardless of its whim, a Chaos Giant's attacks are always devastating.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh_main_unit_long_text_chs_chaos_knights	Chaos Knights are feared throughout the Old World and beyond as merciless butchers capable of turning the course of battle with a single charge. They are towering brutes atop immensely powerful Chaos Steeds, rider and mount clad in thickest plate, each section of armour crafted by a master Daemonsmiths. A Chaos Knight's greaves are jagged blades, well suited to slicing through the flesh of the enemy. Even the frightful reputation of the Chaos Knights is a weapon in its own right, crippling those who would stand against them before a single blow is struck. Many Chaos Knights ride to war with great lances, evil-looking polearms designed to impale and tear their foes. Others wield a deadly assortment of weapons, from cleavers and war-picks to heavy maces. Some Chaos Knights even brandish magical blades, each bearing a small measure of power. Regardless of the form or the hexes inscribed upon these ensorcelled weapons, they are all enchanted in order to kill, and most flicker with dark fire. Each Chaos Knight is a paragon amongst his warrior brethren, for he has trod the path of damnation for many years and holds the favour of the Dark Gods. A Knight's horned helmet may conceal a twisted and permanent rictus smile of sharp metallic fangs, or a striking and cold beauty that steals the breath away. Few have a chance to find out, for those who behold the Knights of Chaos are but moments away from a grisly end. A full unit of Chaos Knights, galloping at speed, will hit a battle line like the mailed fist of the Gods.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh_main_unit_long_text_chs_chaos_lord	Of all the mortal warriors across the civilisations of the world, Chaos Lords are the most feared, for they are truly like gods amongst men. Clad in baroque armour and rich furs, they tower above even other champions of Chaos, who are but feeble children by comparison. A Chaos Lord's indomitable will is forged in the fires of war, his skills are tempered and honed in the crucible of battle, and his blade is eternally quenched in blood. A Chaos Lord is not only an exceptional fighter but also a merciless conqueror. A great leader and strategist, his sheer force of will binds legions of men and monsters alike to his service. Each Chaos Lord's name is spoken in hushed whispers across the lands of Men, his violent deeds written in the blood of his enemies. His is the voice that condemns whole tribes and nations to death. His gaze terrorises his followers into submission and grovelling obedience. An aura of power surrounds each Chaos Lord, drawing ever more devotees to his banner as his legend grows. When a Lord of Chaos marches to war, the world shakes, for in their hearts, all fear that one day a Lord will come who will grind the armies of the world under his heel, and bring about an age of darkness that will never end.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh_main_unit_long_text_chs_chaos_marauders	Chaos Marauders are natural fighters, born into hardship and brought up in a world where surviving each day is no small victory. Only the strong and capable prosper, for the weak are weeded out and killed. They have no time for plough or sickle, for their tools are the axe, the sword and the shield. What their own lands cannot provide, they simple take from the lands of lesser men. The Chieftains that lead these warriors are a daunting sight, brooding hulks of muscle and hair whose bodies are covered in the scars and trophies of battle. Bearing weapons worn from dealing a thousand mortal injuries to those foolish enough to face them, these savage leaders are independent and fierce. These battle-hardened killers are the products of a people so steeped in conflict that, even in times of prosperity, they will fight to the death for the honour of leading the next raid. 	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh_main_unit_long_text_chs_chaos_sorcerer_death	Those champions of Chaos who seek mastery over the magical arts are known as Chaos Sorcerers, and they are madmen and malcontents all. Chaos Sorcerers wield the wild energies of entropy itself, reshaping reality to better serve their whims and those of their dark masters. A word and a gesture from a Chaos Sorcerer can strip a man's flesh from his bones, force a lover to murder his beloved, or cause a regiment of soldiers to burst into flame. They are amongst the most awful and depraved of all servants of Chaos, for they long ago sold their souls in exchange for the heady elixir of pure power. Where many of the world's Wizards, such as those taught by the Colleges of Magic in Altdorf, glean their arcane skill from long years of painstaking research, a Chaos Sorcerer's understanding of the Winds of Magic is instant and innate. However, without the patience and wisdom that such study brings, a Chaos Sorcerer lacks due wariness and respect for the ultimate dangers of magic, and so begins an inexorable descent into deformity and madness. Many are the paths that lead to this ultimate fate, but most often, the Chaos Sorcerer seeks to expand his magical powers or harness more of the occult by simply bartering away another fraction of his soul, losing a little more of his humanity in the process. Before long, the aspirant feels his whole body and mind twist and alter, and as the gnawed remnants of his soul are finally devoured, he is plunged into the whirlpools of insanity, leaving behind nothing of the man who was.	false

unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh_main_unit_long_text_chs_chaos_spawn	A warrior who is visited by too many gifts of the Dark Gods eventually succumbs to madness and mutation. His altered body reaches a point where reason no longer sustains it, and he wails in anguish as his flesh ripples, sprouts and writhes, undergoing the most profound and final of changes. Truly, Chaos Spawn have a thousand faces and forms.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh_main_unit_long_text_chs_chaos_trolls	Chaos Trolls are malformed monsters whose lack of intelligence is as legendary as their great strength. Chaos Trolls are greatly feared because of their unthinking ferocity and indiscriminate appetites. Like all their kind, Chaos Trolls can vomit forth the steaming contents of their guts, dissolving their victims with powerful acids and flesh-eating worms. They are also possessed of powerful regenerative abilities: lost limbs and even heads can grow back. However, Trollflesh is extremely susceptible to the mutating power of Chaos, and Trolls who have lurked too close to the Realm of Chaos find tentacles, screaming maws and even stranger mutations sprouting from their wounds.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh_main_unit_long_text_chs_chaos_warhounds	In Norsca, wolves and hounds prowl in the flickering shadows of the campfires made by the barbarian tribespeople of the frozen lands. The further north the tribe dwells, the more likely it is that the hounds that follow them will be mutants, their bodies swollen by the energies of Chaos. Brutish and bloodthirsty, the Warhounds of Chaos are natural killers built of muscle and fang that prowl the wilderness in ravening packs. They will even charge a spearwall with total abandon, their only concern the moment when their slobbering jaws sink into juicy, yielding flesh.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh_main_unit_long_text_chs_chaos_warriors	Chaos Warriors are fighters of unmatched prowess. Their strength is infernal and their bodies are as tough as the Iron Mountains. Imbued with the power of Chaos and encased in suits of hell-forged armour, a Chaos Warrior is equal to several battle-hardened mortal men. They are no longer truly human, but living weapons, honed perfectly for the bloody tasks before them. A Chaos Warrior has no need of food, drink or sleep, for he is nourished by the carnage that he wreaks. He has nothing but contempt for the weak or the cowardly and goes about the business of murder with a vengeance, for there is always a part of the man who was that rages against that which he has become. A Chaos Warrior's only solace is in slaughter - the fulfilment of his new existence as an instrument of his blasphemous God's will, and at battle's end, his armour is spattered with the lifeblood of the slain.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh_main_unit_long_text_chs_chosen	There are those amongst the ranks of the Chaos Warriors who bear the favour of the Dark Gods more than their fellows. Known amongst their kind as Chosen, their frames are swollen with unholy power, and with the gifts bestowed on them by the Dark Gods in recognition of the many fell deeds they have committed. These gifts are as varied as any other aspect of Chaos, but most mutations tend to be useful as weapons that aid the Chosen in his quest to inflict devastation on the civilised realms of the world. Even if a Chosen bears no such stigmata, it is clear that he carries the grace of the Dark Gods from his aura of dark menace. The Chosen are truly the nobility of Chaos. They lead by example, fighting not as commanders but as elite warriors and champions. In this way, they hope to attack yet more of their master's favour and ascend to the ranks of the truly exalted. They advance unflinchingly through black powder firestorms, hails of arrows and punishing artillery volleys, their purposeful thread never falters as they march ever closer to their prey. Battle lines have buckled and broken at the mere prospect of a unit of Chosen closing in upon them, blades raised so that the methodical butchery of the foe can begin.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh_main_unit_long_text_chs_dragon_ogre	Dragon Ogres are amongst the most ancient of the world's living creatures. Their incredible longevity, as with almost all things supernatural, is the work of the Chaos Gods. Aeons ago, the elders of their race made a pact with the Ruinous Powers, embracing damnation in order to save themselves from a slow decline into extinction. They were given eternal life, and in return, the entire Dragon Ogre race put themselves at the command of the Dark Gods. Since that day, the Dragon Ogres have carved their names across the ages as immortals who can only die in battle, monstrous beings that rouse themselves only in the name of destruction.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh_main_unit_long_text_chs_dragon_ogre_shaggoth	Dragon Ogre Shaggoth are living legends of carnage and devastation. As a Dragon Ogre ages, it becomes ever larger, growing stronger and more powerful. As long as it can find lightning to refresh its body and revitalise its mind, there is no limit to the size one can reach. The eldest and most primal of their kind are truly titanic beings, each a towering mountain of muscle and fury, reinforced by the power of the raging storm.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh_main_unit_long_text_chs_exalted_hero	The frozen north spawns some of the hardiest warriors in all the world. Each is a paragon of deadly ability and lethal intent. Some ascend to command entire nations, some pursue the esoteric paths of the arcane, but the majority dedicate themselves to little more than the brutal butchery of all who stand in their way. These ruthless killers are known as Exalted Heroes. The history of many Exalted Heroes, recorded in scattered chronicles by the free people of the Old World, is a catalogue of woes and evil deeds. Their infamy shines bright as they capture the notice of the Dark Gods of Chaos with ever-greater feats of slaughter. They frequently seek out others of their kind to engage in ritual combat. When two champions of Chaos clash, they duel to the death in the manner of gladiators, using the full force of every weapon at their disposal. When a victor emerges, bloodied but triumphant, he will cut a grisly trophy from his foe, claiming both his vanquished enemy's weapons and followers as his own. If the triumphant champion has truly excelled, he may even succeed in attracting the attention of the Dark Gods and, in doing so, receive a more permanent reward for his deeds in the form of a mutation of Daemonic gift. With each victory, he grows ever closer to becoming a Chaos Lord, with whole armies to command and Daemonhood within his reach.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh_main_unit_long_text_chs_forsaken	Forsaken are frothing maniacs that howl and scream as they sprint pell-mell towards the enemy lines, mutated limbs flailing and distended jaws snapping like those of ravenous beasts. Though they were once proud and mighty Chaos Warriors, because of the severe mutations bestowed upon them, they have become something less than human, with no more understanding of battlefield tactics than the hounds that gather around their bone-strewn lairs. Forsaken plunge headlong into battle without discipline or caution. They attack without heed for their own defence, a random mass of mutant appendages snapping in fury as they seek to tear their foes apart. These unfortunates have been reduced to the level of animals, and snarl and growl in a guttural parody of true language. Where they once killed in the name of martial ambition and the glory of the Dark Gods, they now kill because of a savage and unnatural hunger.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh_main_unit_long_text_chs_gorebeast_chariot	Gorebeast Chariots are even heavier and sturdier than other Chaos Chariots. No normal beast would have the strength to pull such a massive instrument of war, and they are therefore pulled into battle by a Gorebeast - a muscular creature renowned for its violent temperament. These grunting brutes strike their prey with such shocking force that those not impaled upon jutting armour spikes are torn apart by the impact. Even the lowliest of beasts recognise the bulky shape of a Gorebeast as synonymous with death. Each iron-clad chariot drawn by one of these formidable mutants is thus followed, at some distance, by circling carrion crows and slinking scavenger hounds waiting to feast on the bloody remnants of a Gorebeast's Grim harvest.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh_main_unit_long_text_chs_hellcannon	Part-Daemon, part-war machine, a Hellcannon is a massive construct of metal that growls and shakes with daemonic sentience. In battle, these arcane engines heave crackling blasts of raw energy that soar through the air into their targets, liquefying anything they touch and sending the survivors insane with fear. Hellcannons are guided by a team of corrupt and sadistic Chaos Dwarfs. These malign warsmiths escort and restrain the Hellcannons into battle, for the Daemons bound within hunger for a banquet of flesh. Such is the Hellcannon's bloodlust that it must be chained to the ground to stop it rampaging towards enemy lines. Even these precautions often prove inadequate, as there is little that can stay a Hellcannon's lust for destruction. The Chaos Dwarfs load their charge by brutally shovelling the bodies of their enemies into the Hellcannon's dire-furnace. Flesh runs like wax as the Daemon-machine's hearth feasts on body and bone. Soon, only the souls of its victims are left, harnessed in the Hellcannon's gullet as crackling bolts of energy that are fired towards the enemy in powerful spasms of malice.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh_main_unit_long_text_chs_kholek_suneater	Kholek Suneater is a Shaggoth of tremendous age. He is one of the first-born kin of Krakanrok the Black, father of the Dragon Ogres. Kholek was present when the terrible pact with the Dark Gods was forged, pledging their race to an eternity of servitude in exchange for immortality. The sagas tell that Kholek's part in the bargain was such an affront to nature that the sun hid its face behind a bank of storm clouds and has never looked upon Kholek since that fateful day. True enough, Kholek's coming is heralded by roiling black thunderheads. Where the Herald of the Tempest walks, a raging storm blots out the sun.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh_main_unit_long_text_chs_lord_change	A Lord of Change is hideously unpredictable and manipulative. Behind its gaze lies a curious and wreckful mind, deeply intelligent, yet as uncaring of consequence as it is fascinated by it. The Lord of Change is like a child playing upon some gigantic anthill, poking with a stick at its inhabitants and laughing at the hopeless antics of their defence. Nothing pleases him more than to see the world broken and made anew, to redirect the course of a life or even history itself, spilling hope upon the ground while raising the ambition of others up to an unexpected pinnacle of power. As might be expected of a creature born of pure magic and bound to the will of the Master of Sorcery, a Lord of Change is a potent spellcaster. The Winds of Magic obey his every command, allowing him to summon whirling tempests of change and mutation, blast the enemies of Tzeentch with bolts of multi-coloured fire or unravel the mind of an enemy spellcaster from the inside. Sorcery is not the only weapon at the command of a Lord of Change - he is also an erudite tactician, well versed in a thousand ploys and stratagems for any given situation. Accordingly, if a Lord of Change prefers to remain uncommitted in battle it is not through lack of courage or ferocity, but because he likes to direct his forces and better control the flow of the fighting. He instinctively sees the skeins of fate that play over the battlefield, and knows all too well how they can be manipulated.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh_main_unit_long_text_chs_marauder_chieftain	The tribes of Northmen that flock southwards with any Chaos invasion are known by those in their path as Chaos Marauders. These savage barbarians fight with heavy axes and cruelly barbed flails, and charge in great howling mobs towards the foe. They have little fear of dying in battle, for they know that they fight under the scrutiny of their gods, and that cowards are beneath their deities' notice. The Chieftains that lead these warriors are a daunting sight, brooding hulks of muscle and hair whose bodies are covered in the scars and trophies of battle. Bearing weapons worn from dealing a thousand mortal injuries to those foolish enough to face them, these savage leaders are independent and fierce. These battle-hardened killers are the products of a people so steeped in conflict that, even in times of prosperity, they will fight to the death for the honour of leading the next raid.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh_main_unit_long_text_chs_marauder_horsemen	Some tribes of Marauders hold horses in high esteem, while others regard them with fear and superstition. To many, a warhorse is a sign of status, and only the best warriors may ride them. The steeds ridden by these tribes are powerful beasts, foul-tempered and strong of limb. Once a rider has broken such a horse, it will remain loyal to him until death, but they remain vicious and unruly should a stranger approach. Fed on a diet of human flesh and watered-down blood, these snorting, high-spirited steeds have a glint of intelligent menace in their eyes, and will trample, kick and bite as if berserk when engaged at close quarters. In battle, the speed and mobility of Marauder Horsemen leaves even the most able cavalrymen of the Old World sorely lacking. Able to steer their steeds with the subtlest of movements of the waist and knees, the tribesmen have both hands free to wield wicked blades and hooked axes.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh_main_unit_long_text_chs_sarthorael	Although no Daemon’s true name can ever be known, there has been talk for aeons of the one called “Sarthorael”. Like all Lords of Change, the Ever-Watcher revels in his contriving and devious nature, hiding his true manipulative genius behind a screen of erratic and fickle behaviour. Yet Sarthorael is more than a mere Lord of Change - he is one of Tzeentch’s favoured, sent to spread mayhem to those that the Great Changer deems deserving. Whilst the world of mortals should tremble when a Lord of Change appears before them, so too should Daemons be wary, for Tzeentch does not discriminate – all are fair targets in his game. And so Sarthorael is sent, watching and waiting, with all the craft and slyness of his master, to judge whether the end can really be brought about and, when the time is right, to see if those who stand upon the wastes really have the strength to do it.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh_main_unit_long_text_chs_sigvald_the_magnificent	Though he appears to be little more than sixteen summers of age, Sigvald the Magnificent has blighted the world for over three hundred years. The personification of beauty on the outside, but rot within, Sigvald rides at the head of an army of utterly devoted followers who would give their lives for him without a second thought. His elite bodyguard bear mirrored shields so that Sigvald might bask in his own divine glory, and dozens of exotic females attend to his every whim and desire. Such are the depths of Sigvald's self-obsession that he will even call his retainers to attend him with their mirrors in the midst of battle, preening and murmuring compliments to himself as man plunge into battle and die all around him.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh_main_unit_long_text_chs_sorcerer_lord_death	Those champions of Chaos who seek mastery over the magical arts are known as Chaos Sorcerers, and they are madmen and malcontents all. Chaos Sorcerers wield the wild energies of entropy itself, reshaping reality to better serve their whims and those of their dark masters. A word and a gesture from a Chaos Sorcerer can strip a man's flesh from his bones, force a lover to murder his beloved, or cause a regiment of soldiers to burst into flame. They are amongst the most awful and depraved of all servants of Chaos, for they long ago sold their souls in exchange for the heady elixir of pure power. Where many of the world's Wizards, such as those taught by the Colleges of Magic in Altdorf, glean their arcane skill from long years of painstaking research, a Chaos Sorcerer's understanding of the Winds of Magic is instant and innate. However, without the patience and wisdom that such study brings, a Chaos Sorcerer lacks due wariness and respect for the ultimate dangers of magic, and so begins an inexorable descent into deformity and madness. Many are the paths that lead to this ultimate fate, but most often, the Chaos Sorcerer seeks to expand his magical powers or harness more of the occult by simply bartering away another fraction of his soul, losing a little more of his humanity in the process. Before long, the aspirant feels his whole body and mind twist and alter, and as the gnawed remnants of his soul are finally devoured, he is plunged into the whirlpools of insanity, leaving behind nothing of the man who was.	false

unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh_main_unit_long_text_dwf_ancestor_dramar_hammerfist	Like all Master Engineers, Dramar Hammerfist was a valuable member of his throng at Eight Peaks. Less of a warrior and more a master of fight-or-flight tactics, his preparedness for battle was such that he was always well-equipped enough to avoid face-to-face altercations. Instead, he would either take down his enemies from afar with his modified rifles or artillery pieces or, if all else failed, simply make a swift escape in one of his custom-built Gyrocopters. Known for his offensive engines of destruction, Hammerfist often left the design of defensive fortifications on home soil to lesser Engineers, considering it a bore. As the Time of Woes fell upon the Dwarfs, he was determined not to be entrenched in Eight Peaks, joining the first few forays against the invaders, led by Halkenhaf Stonebeard, and eventually going missing in action.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh_main_unit_long_text_dwf_ancestor_halkenhaf_stonebeard	With the Dwarf realm dwindling during the Time of Woes, Halkenhaf Stonebeard and his allies were initially successful in repelling the first few attacks against Eight Peaks. Like every gatekeeper before him, Stonebeard was a fearsome warrior, known for being able to move his axe with such incredible speed in battle that it would appear as a blur around him, like a rotor of a Gyrocopter in flight. Ultimately, the lesser warriors defending the Hold alongside him all perished, leaving him the last Dwarf standing. Refusing to leave his post, Stonebeard fought on, eventually meeting his end at the hand – or mouth, rather – of a hungry Troll. But it is said that he continued to swing his axe around wildly in a frenzy of slaughter, right up until he was picked up and swallowed whole down the monster’s gullet. With the gatekeeper defeated, the Citadel would be captured soon after.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh_main_unit_long_text_dwf_ancestor_lunn_ironhammer	King Lunn Ironhammer was one of many Dwarf leaders who fought to protect the Karaks during the Time of Woes. Remembered as the last Dwarf king to hold sway over Eight Peaks before it was lost, he staunchly carried out his duties until the very end. With enemies closing in, King Lunn delayed his own throng’s retreat until he had successfully rune-sealed the Ancestor Tombs deep below the fortress, forever preventing any from entering, ensuring the continued sanctity of his Ancestors’ remains. Now, centuries later, Belegar has a powerful ally in his summoned forefathers’ ghost. With his help, Clan Angrund will surely succeed in honouring their vow to take back Eight Peaks once more - lest the shame of defeat will be carried down the Ironhammer bloodline forever!  	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh_main_unit_long_text_dwf_ancestor_throni_ironbrow	Karak Azul is a prosperous Dwarfen city to the south of Eight Peaks, renowned for producing powerful weapons of unrivalled quality. In the ancient times it was a process overseen by the Master Runesmith Throni Ironbrow, a distant blood-relative and close friend of King Lunn Ironhammer of Eight Peaks. When Ironbrow received word that Eight Peaks would likely be the next stronghold to fall, he demanded permission to leave his throng to make the treacherous Underway journey northwards to help his kinsperson. Such was his value to Karak Azul that his request was immediately denied – perhaps it was little surprise that Eight Peaks would eventually fall, leaving Karak Azul the only Southern Dwarfhold to withstand the Greenskin armies that surged into Dwarf territory during the Time of Woes.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh_main_unit_long_text_dwf_belegar_ironhammer	It is a bitter legacy of hatred and resentment that Belegar Ironhammer has inherited. For he is leader of the Angrund Clan and direct descendant of King Lunn, the last Dwarf to rule Karak Eight Peaks before its fall. While the grand mansion of their people - a Hold second only to Karaz-a-Karak in terms of wealth and prestige - was being despoiled, the scions of the former King laboured elsewhere, shorn of home and honour. Many of the ruling heirs of Angrund have attempted to reclaim their former glory, to avenge the grudges bequeathed to them. Despite the weight of years and the hopelessness of the cause, when Belegar came of age he made bold oaths and set out to recover his full inheritance. Belegar has since established himself as a master of subterranean warfare. On his orders enemy probes are smashed, ambushes overcome and infiltration paths blockaded. Yet Belegar is not content to sit behind his fortifications, and many times he has led assaults into the Underhalls of his forefathers. There, from the shattered remains of his Ancestors' tombs, Belegar claimed the rune-struck chunk of rock that now serves as his Oath Stone. It is said amongst Dwarfs that his warrior skills are second only to those of the Slayer King, and that at will Belegar can summon the vengeful powers of his Ancestors. Yet for all his victories, he remains embittered, vowing to one day reclaim all of Karak Eight Peaks for his own.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh_main_unit_long_text_dwf_bolt_thrower	Tried and true, many Clans still swear by the Bolt Thrower - a war machine that the Dwarfs have used since the days of the Ancestor Gods. Bolt Throwers are large versions of crossbows, able to fire a Dwarf-sized bolt over a long distance. Reliable and accurate, some have been in service for many thousands of years yet can still bring down a flying Wyvern or skewer a Troll.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh_main_unit_long_text_dwf_cannon	Cannons were first made by the Dwarfs of Zhufbar, although now, many of the larger Holds make their own. One of the most potent war machines, a cannon can shatter the most heavily armoured foe, pour shot into massed enemy formations, level a foe's cities or fortifications and topple the largest of monsters. They are, however, somewhat temperamental devices, and even the best-forged cannon in the world (those made by Dwarfs, naturally) are subject to occasional malfunction. The slightest crack or premature ignition of black powder can result in devastating accidents. In addition to the cannons housed within Holds, many Clans maintain a number of cannons that can join a throng on the march. These are hauled into overlooking positions on the battlefield where their long range and potent shot can dictate the course of the enemy's actions. Give the quality of their make, many Cannons have been in service for a number of centuries and are revered by their crew.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh_main_unit_long_text_dwf_dwarf_warriors	Dwarfs make formidable fighters - they are strong and extremely resilient, broad of shoulder and wide of girth. Although by no means quick, they are physically robust and can maintain a steady plodding pace, marching for days on end despite being loaded down by burdens and heavy mail. When they charge into battle, the momentum generated by their wide, armour-clad bodies is remarkable, hitting the foe with a resounding impact. They have broken many enemy battle lines this way, splintering Elven phalanxes, carving through Orc formations and hacking apart the great masses of Skaven that make up their verminous armies. Protected by their heavy mail, their skilful use of overlapping shield walls and, finally, by their own tough and obstinate nature, Dwarf individuals, units and armies as a whole seem able to absorb punishing blows that would cause other races to break and flee. With Dwarfs, such suffering only serves to make them angrier - and with beards bristling and hands clenched around axe hafts and mighty warhammers, the Dwarfs regroup to charge anew. Their feeble-limbed foes, too worn out and tired at the end to even lift their weapons, are slaughtered, save for those fast enough to flee the iron-shod and implacable advance of the Dwarfs.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh_main_unit_long_text_dwf_flame_cannon	Few weapons put fear into the heart of the Dwarfs’ foes like the Flame Cannon, one of the deadliest inventions of the Engineers' Guild. A volatile concoction of hot oil and molten tar is pumped into the weapon’s barrel and pressurised with air; soon the forces inside are tremendous and the barrel is almost ready to burst. Once triggered, burning oil arcs into the air towards the enemy ranks, landing in the middle of the foe and spraying boiling tar over them. Enemies have their flesh melted off them in a slough, leaving only scorched bones and foul-smelling liquid that is best described as "goo". 	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh_main_unit_long_text_dwf_grudge_thrower	Catapults were one of the earliest of the Dwarf-made war machines and have been used to command the approaches to Dwarfholds for many millennia. During the War of Vengeance, so great was their fury with the Elves that the Dwarfs began the practice of inscribing grudges on the rocks being used as ammunition. This custom stuck, and many crew believe that the engine is only as good as the grudges it throws - and therefore spend as great deal of time carving their anger directly onto the shaped stone ammunition. Grudge Throwers are still used by all Dwarfholds and over the long years there have been many famous engines whose renown has spread far and wide across the Karaz Ankor and beyond. Perhaps most famous of all was the 'Gob-lobber', a legendary catapult which drove off a great many Greenskin attacks during the Goblin Wars - although this was more down to the crew's use of live gobbo ammunition rather than pure accuracy.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh_main_unit_long_text_dwf_gyrobombers	Since the first flight of the Gyrocopter, Engineers have been seeking ways to upgrade its payload. There were times, such as when Greenskin invasions filled the valleys, swarming up a mountain's flanks to besiege a Dwarfhold, that Gyrocopters buzzing around the flanks just wasn't going to break up the attack. With some reconfiguration, and by losing the heavy weight of the steam gun, the Engineers' Guild were able to significantly increase the size and number of bombs carried. Thus was the Gyrobomber invented. Armed with their impressive bomb racks and a nose-mounted clatterygun, the Gyrobombers stream over the Dwarf battle lines seeking to obliterate the foe's largest formations. Already, several flying formations have become famous - perhaps most notably the Skyhammers from Zhufbar and the Blackhammer Bombers and Karaz-a-Karak.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh_main_unit_long_text_dwf_gyrocopter	A treasured invention of the Engineers' Guild, it took many centuries for the flying machines known as Gyrocopters to gain acceptance among the more conservative Dwarfs. As the legend goes, the inventor was inspired by watching Dragons swooping down from inaccessible mountain crags, and so combined the idea of wings with the engines from drilling and grinding machines. Although originally used to fly over difficult mountain terrain and drop supplies and messages to beleaguered settlements, the Gyrocopter was soon tested over battlefields with great success. Its main armament is a steam gun, but over the years its firepower has been augmented with bomb payloads fitted into the craft’s stabilisers. In the present day, even small strongholds have an air fleet and skilled Engineer pilots as part of their throng.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh_main_unit_long_text_dwf_hammerers	A Dwarf Hold’s Hammerers are individuals who have proven themselves in uncountable battles, showing not just great strength and deadly martial prowess, but also steadfast loyalty and a bold and courageous nature. They are formed into a hard-hitting shock unit, a force capable of breaking enemy formations the way a heavy maulhammer crushes shale. They swing their hammers in sweeping arcs, hitting their enemies with such vigour that only enchanted or hell-forged armour can withstand the force of their blows. Dwarf battle lines have been known to cheer at the sight of the great hammers rising and falling around their King's banner, beating out a rhythmic noise that is not unlike the deep-booming industrial sounds made by the vast drop hammers found in the larger Dwarf forges.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh_main_unit_long_text_dwf_ironbreakers	Clad from head to toe in suits of Gromril armour, Ironbreakers can survive in a treacherous world of rockfalls and sudden ambush. They stand resolute, barring danger from advancing beyond their post. It is an honour to be selected to join the Ironbreakers, for they are trusted to protect the Hold's most vulnerable entrances. Only the strongest and bravest are accepted into their ranks, but the dark offers no vainglory, and those warriors who choose a path of greater ambition must seek out the Hammerers. Ironbreakers are trained to fight in tight formations, wedged into the confines of narrow tunnels. There, they find defensible positions and let the enemy break upon their overlapping shields as waves crash into rock. Impervious, implacable and unmoving, they form a living line, Gromril-hard, that holds back the flood terror that lurks in the dark below. Enemies fall before their axes like Winter wheat before the scythe and blows clang harmlessly off their nigh-impervious armour or are caught and deflected by their sturdy shields. Such is the prowess of the Ironbreakers that they will often be called upon to fight on the surface - aiding the throng in time of a muster. However, for each battle under the light of sun or moon, the Ironbreakers will have fought dozens in the deep dark beneath the mountains.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh_main_unit_long_text_dwf_irondrakes	It was the Engineers' Guild that invented the Drakegun, a weapon which fires a searing bolt of blazing energy that can even halt the onrushing charge of enraged Mangler Squigs. Ironbreakers who show an aptitude with the Drakegun are given further training and formed into new units known as Irondrakes. When Drakeguns were first used, even Gromril armour struggled to protect their wielders against the intense heat generated by the fiery blasts. Thus, new armoured suits were developed bearing runes of protection first designed to safeguard those who work in the high temperatures of the massive forges. The Irondrakes now prove so effective that their services are pressed into action wherever a throng may fight.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh_main_unit_long_text_dwf_longbeards	Longbeards have fought in more wars, beaten more enemies and endured greater hardships than any young Dwarf can possibly imagine. They constantly grumble about how today's Goblins are far smaller and weedier than they used to be and how nothing is as well made as it was in their day. No young Dwarf, as hot-headed and tempestuous as he might be, would dare gainsay a Longbeard; after all, they have much more experience - and the beard to prove it! A Longbeard unit in a battle line is likened to a reliable anchor bolt or bulwark that stands fast and supports the other formations. Woe betide any beardlings who falter under the Longbeards' stern (if rheumy) eyes, for they will be admonished within inches of their very lives. It might not be easy for other units to hold the battle line within earshot of a unit of Longbeards, yet it is also a great honour that redoubles a Dwarf's stoicism and makes even beardlings eager to prove themselves (or at least not give the Longbeards any further ammunition).	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh_main_unit_long_text_dwf_master_engineer	Given the number of war machines with which the Dwarfs can equip themselves, it is not surprising to find members of the Engineers' Guild accompanying a throng to battle. To most Master Engineers, this "field work" is tiresome, as it takes them away from their forges and workshops and shows them first-hand how their beloved engines of destruction are dragged into position, dented by enemy shot and not as fully optimised as would be ideal. As all Dwarfs revere fine craftsmanship, their war machines are the most polished and best cared-for in the world, treated by their crews with all the respect due a venerable Clan member. Nonetheless, even this level of care falls well short of the wishes of the notoriously cantankerous Engineers. Master Engineers are doughty warriors who, although more interested in drafting plans for fortifications or designing new mines, are more than capable of fighting in the frontlines. To protect their precious war machines, they fight with all the determination and grit of their race.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh_main_unit_long_text_dwf_miners	When Dwarfs march to war, many mining Clans form regiments to join the battle. As a point of pride, they do not bear axes, but instead wield the same heavy two-handed mining picks and mattocks they use to laboriously carve out tunnels. As it turns out, these well-balanced and sturdily-made tools work equally well whether digging in to bedrock or hacking apart Goblins. Because tunnelling in the deeps is dangerous work, Miners constantly wear heavy armour and helms. Down the ages, this mail has served to protect them against rockfall and cave-ins as well as turning aside such attacks as Elf arrows or rusty Skaven blades. The longer and more established a Dwarf mine is, the more likely it is to be augmented with mechanical contrivances. Great steam engines draw in fresh air or haul chains to tow wagonloads of rock out of the depths. Some Miners even take to war with a few of their 'gadgets', such as blasting charges or a steam drill to aid in tunnelling under the enemy battle lines quickly. While the most conservative Dwarfs still grumble about these newer generations, stoutly wielding a pick to carve through a foe and winning the battle go a long way to aiding acceptance.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh_main_unit_long_text_dwf_organ_gun	An invention of the Dwarf Engineers' Guild, the four-barrelled Organ Gun is so called because its arrays of barrels resembles the pipes of a musical organ. The Organ Gun's barrels are smaller and lighter than an ordinary cannon's, which means it lacks that extreme range and hitting power, but has the advantage of firing a barrage of shots all at the same time. With a well-placed salvo, and all its barrels firing to maximum effect, an Organ Gun has been known to blow away entire enemy units at a time.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh_main_unit_long_text_dwf_quarrellers	When the Clans are called to fight, some Dwarfs arm themselves with crossbows and join the battle as Quarrellers. These formations are tasked with raining bolts down upon their foes – a task they perform with orderly zeal. Quarrellers seek to thin down the enemy's ranks, punish units attempting to outflank their own forces and engage in ranged duels with the foe's missile-armed troops. Protected by heavy armour and their own sturdy constitutions, it is a rare day when an enemy – even one with more skilled marksmen than the Dwarfs – can win a long-ranged shooting contest against a unit of Quarrellers. Of course, should the enemy approach near enough to engage the Quarrellers in close combat, they will find hardened warriors eager to put their axes to work. 	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh_main_unit_long_text_dwf_rangers	Rangers are the long-ranged eyes and ears of most Dwarf settlements. They patrol far from the safety of the Hold, often spending long periods out in the wilderness, keeping watch on the Dwarfs' many enemies and tracking dangerous beasts. It is they who explore hidden valleys, push through collapsed sections of the Underway and scale the cliffsides in search of new pathways. Rangers will hunt down and dispose of lone monsters or ambush small mobs of Goblins, but when they confront larger creatures or enemy armies on the march, signals are sent to the nearest outposts to alert them of the encroaching danger. When dealing with large enemy forces, Rangers will first attempt to forewarn all Dwarfs in the invaders' path before trailing the foe, picking off stragglers and waiting for an opportunity to wreak havoc. In this way, when the foe finally confronts a Dwarf force, the Rangers will often be in position to outflank it, arriving behind enemy battle lines to destroy war machines, pincushion lone Wizards, or launch an attack to otherwise help the Dwarfs gain an advantage.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh_main_unit_long_text_dwf_runelord	Runesmiths work spells in with their hammercraft, binding the Winds of Magic into mighty runes of power. They are a suspicious lot who jealously protect the secrets kept in their anvils and hammers, guarding the knowledge that allows them to make magic items - weapons, armour, rings and talismans - of greater potency than those wrought by any other mortal race. In times of great need, the most powerful Runelords bring an Anvil of Doom to battle - the most ancient heirlooms of the entire Dwarf race. They are the very anvils upon which the rune weapons of legend were forged, and were, perhaps, the very creations of the great Forgefather Grungni. They are specially made to attract and hold the Winds of Magic, arcane powers which can be captured and subsequently unleashed by a Runelord. Separate runes struck in the right order can call upon the different Ancestor Gods - Valaya for loyalty, Grungni to boost the power of arms and armour, and Grimnir to unlock the energies of fury.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh_main_unit_long_text_dwf_runesmith	Runesmiths work spells with their hammercraft, binding the Winds of Magic into mighty runes of power. They are a suspicious lot and jealously protect the secrets kept in their anvils and hammers, guarding the knowledge that allows them to make magic items - weapon, armour, rings and talismans - of greater potency than items wrought by any other mortal race. In battle, Runesmiths aid their side by dampening enemy magic - earthing spells harmlessly before they can wreak havoc amongst the Dwarfs. They do this in the same manner as they capture the Winds of Magic to forge magic items, and they often bring along rune-covered talismans to aid in this endeavour. Many Runesmiths bear weapons and armour of their own crafting, and  they are eager to show their comrades exactly how effective they can be. Whether by some gift of Grungni, or perhaps as a side effect of centuries of beating white-hot metal, when a Runesmith feels the rage of battle, his weapons, and those of friendly foes around him, begin to glow and radiate heat as if remembering the forgefires from which they were created. This aura of power has proven effective in helping blades penetrate the armoured or toughened hides of any foe.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh_main_unit_long_text_dwf_slayers	Slayers are the most deadly of all Dwarfs: outlandish doom-seekers who have dedicated the entire fibre of their being to the hardest and most destructive life of battle that they can find. Such Dwarfs invariably carry a great shame from their past, at some point having taken the solemn and binding vow of the Slayer Cult to send them on their death-quest. Shaving their heads into fearsome bright plumes, they are obliged to forevermore seek death in combat at the hands of the deadliest enemy they can find. In times of battle, Slayers arrive from the wilderness to join a throng, deliberately seeking out the most insurmountable targets on the battlefield – Trolls, Ogres, Dragons – even Giants! Many desperate wars have been won by the ferocity and sheer determination of the Slayers.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh_main_unit_long_text_dwf_thane_lord	The leaders of a Dwarf throng are its Lord and thanes. These are the most powerful fighters in the army, fell-handed warriors equipped with the finest arms and armour of the Clan's weapon hoard. As a rule, Dwarf Lords and Thanes are a grim sort, for they are leaders of a dour people. Upon their broad shoulders is carried the weight of untold debt - the inherited grudges of a long-suffering and unforgiving race. It is their lot to avenge all wrongdoing to their Clan, Hold or race, not just in the present, but also for all time. Failure to redress an injury from antiquity is particularly galling, an act of disrespect to the much-revered ancestors. While Dwarfs are notably an infantry force, there are a few exceptions among their leaders; some Lords are carried into battle by Shieldbearers - stout warriors who serve their liege by hefting a shield as a fighting platform. This is common amongst Dwarfs of the southern Holds and has been continued elsewhere, notable by King Alrik Ranulfsson of Karak Hirn. In other Clans, especially northern ones, Lords and Thanes prefer to fight atop Oath Stones, rocks upon which runes are struck - listing out the Clan's honour, or perhaps the Lord's lineage or deeds. The stone is a symbol of their homeland, a piece of their Dwarfhold made manifest.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh_main_unit_long_text_dwf_thorgrim_grudgebearer	Thorgrim Grudgebearer is the current High King of the Dwarfs. He is a throwback to the High Kings of old - eager for new conquests, mighty in battle, and a merciless enemy. Yet upon his worn brow there also sits a great wisdom, and he is able to uphold the ancient traditions as well as to accept (if not embrace) needed changes, such as alliances and new technology. Thorgrim is forever brooding upon how to return his people to their former glory. As the ultimate ruler of the Dwarfs, the Great Book of Grudges is entrusted into his keeping. It is Thorgrim's avowed wish to avenge every single entry contained in that voluminous tome - an impossible task if he should live a thousand lifetimes. Yet such is his resolve that he has already helped to rejuvenate the whole of the Karaz Ankor. Tales of his deeds, and the long list of grudges already struck out, fill his grim warriors with a feeling that the Dwarfs have long done without: hope. Borne upon the Throne of Power and brandishing the Axe of Grimnir, Thorgrim is at the forefront of what the Dwarfs hope will be a great conquering - a new age of retribution!	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh_main_unit_long_text_dwf_thunderers	Standing in closely-packed ranks, Thunderers take aim and then discharge their handguns – unleashing a thunderous fury and a cloud of gun smoke. Being methodical, the Dwarfs continue to load and fire in a disciplined manner. While the onset of bloodthirsty foes might cause lesser races to rush their aim, the steady coolness of the Dwarfs, not the mention the precision of their weaponry, ensures that every volley is fired with the same lethal accuracy as the last, until the moment the Thunderers take up their axes and meet the foe's charge in the bloody press of close-combat.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh_main_unit_long_text_dwf_ungrim_ironfist	There are few kinds of monsters that walk the world that Ungrim Ironfist has not slain in battle. Armed with the enormous Axe of Dargo, Ungrim deals death - carving a path of red ruin before him while singing songs of old in a booming voice. Atop his head is a bright orange crest that rises above a study horned helmet set with a golden crown. For Ungrim is both a Slayer and a king, more than likely the last of the line of Slayer Kings of Karak Kadrin. Although Ungrim cannot seek his death in Slayer fashion, he grows ever more restless, leading the throng of Karak Kadrin into countless battles. Inspired by his High King and seeking to avenge his slain son, Ungrim marches to war with the least provocation. It was Ungrim who slew the Dragon of Black Peak and who broke Queek Headtaker's siege of King Belegar's citadel in Karak Eight Peaks. The Slayer King has beaten Ogre mercenary Golgfag Maneater and held off a Chaos army in the Battle of High Pass. Most Dwarfs are amazed Ungrim has lived so long, and none think that a mighty death in battle can be very far away.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh_main_unit_long_text_emp_balthasar_gelt	Balthasar Gelt's research into new formulations of black powder even made him popular with the Imperial Engineers School, an organisation that often dismisses magic as superstitious nonsense. However, during these studies, a freak explosion almost ended Balthasar's quest for knowledge forever. Somehow he survived, and from that day on has only ever been seen swathed in shimmering, metallic robes and wearing a golden face mask. Some say that beneath his mask his skin has turned pure gold, while others whisper that he is horribly disfigured, though the truth of the matter is known only to Balthasar. One thing is certain: the accident only furthered his will to succeed, and this determination increased his power to new heights. After defeating Thyrus Gormann of the Bright Order in a ritual magic duel, Balthasar became Supreme Patriarch of the Colleges of Magic, replacing the long-standing prominence of Fire with that of Metal.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh_main_unit_long_text_emp_bright_wizard	The Lore of Fire, or Pyromancy, is borne upon the searing Wind of Aqshy – the study of the Bright Order. Fire Wizards are easily recognised for their red robes and wild orange hair and beards, and are ruddy of skin that is frequently adorned with tattoos writhing with the weaving of their spells. They are of a fiery temperament, their anger capable of changing from a guttering flame to a raging inferno in a split second. At the heart of the Bright College which trains those gifted in the ways of Aqshy, a gigantic beacon burns both day and night, casting an eerie scarlet glow over neighbouring districts.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh_main_unit_long_text_emp_celestial_wizard	The Comet of Power is the symbol of the Celestial Order, which consists of Wizards who study the Lore of the Heavens derived from the Wind of Azyr. Celestial Wizards, also known as Astromancers, spend most of their time gazing into the night skies, plotting the movements of astral bodies. They are experts in divining the future, and the most powerful of the order can even scry portents by peering into crystal balls. Celestial Wizards are equally feared and respected for the awesome powers that lie at their disposal; their spells are able to call lightning from the skies and summon meteorites to smite their enemies.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh_main_unit_long_text_emp_demigryph_knights	In the depths of the Empire’s forests there lurk many foul and fearsome creatures, yet also beasts of more noble heritage, harnessed for war by the Knightly Orders. Most famous of these are the Demigryphs, who have proven themselves as loyal and powerful steeds on countless battlefields throughout the Empire’s proud history. Demigryph Knights do not tend to overwhelm their prey in great sweeping charges. Instead, they are more likely to engage the enemy in protracted melee assaults, where the strength and endurance of their mounts will become a decisive factor in the outcome. Demigryphs are well suited to the savage and bloody nature of such fighting, with their claws and razor-sharp beaks cutting a bloody swathe through their foes at close quarters.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh_main_unit_long_text_emp_empire_knights	The Knightly Orders of the Empire are organised along strict hierarchical lines, with every novice trained in martial values until ready to take up the mantle of a fully-fledged Knight. Of the many warrior orders throughout the Empire, the Knights of Sigmar’s Blood, Knights of the Broken Sword, Knights Griffon and the Knights of the Blazing Sun are but few from a long list of the worthy. 	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh_main_unit_long_text_emp_general_captain_empire	The armies of the Empire are led by warriors who have been trained to direct their forces as effortlessly as a swordsman wields a blade. First and foremost amongst these great leaders are the Elector Counts, inspirational and famous individuals whose mere presence can steady a wavering battle line. The knowledge that their count is personally fighting beside them is enough to embolden the courage of a province's soldiers and strengthen their resolve. In practice, however, it is unfeasible for Elector Counts to command every force that must be despatched, for the Empire is a dangerous land, and its territories are forever under attack from savage monsters and marauding armies. Often, command is delegated to a trusted soldier considered to be an honourable leader of men, and this officer will lead the province's forces when the count cannot. Of course there are always exceptions, and some of the more bellicose counts, such as Valmir von Raukov of Ostland, have an unhealthy love for the clash of swords and the thunder of cannons, thus taking to the field of battle whenever they can. Many of the men appointed by an Elector Count to lead an army will also be nobles of the Empire, educated in martial pursuits from an early age - falconry, swordsmanship and hunting Beastmen in the forests. Others have risen through the ranks, having first stood amongst the rank and file with a bloody halberd in their hands. These officers vary greatly in standing, depending on the size of the force they lead, and can be known as captain, marshals, generals or simply commanders. Regardless of their station, the vast majority will be tried and tested veterans of many years who have a fine understanding of the craft of soldiering, having spent most of their lives fighting in defence of the Empire.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh_main_unit_long_text_emp_great_cannon	The Great Cannons of the Imperial Gunnery School are the terror of the Empire's foes. Their thunderous fire sends iron balls hammering into the ranks of enemy warriors, each impact ploughing bloody furrows through tightly packed regiments. Even the mightiest creatures cannot ignore the power of a Great Cannon, as was ably demonstrated at the Siege of Middenheim, when Master Gunner Pumhart von Steyr decapitated a raging Dragon with a single well-placed shot.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh_main_unit_long_text_emp_great_swords	Regiments of Greatswords garrison the castles of the Elector Counts and form their lord's honour guard on state occasions. These grim men are equipped with huge two-handed swords called zweihanders that can cleave an armoured Knight in twain with one blow. Greatswords are also adorned with superb suits of Dwarf-forged plate armour, for these elite troops are expected to fight in the thick of the bloodiest and most dangerous combats of a battle. Upon a soldier's induction into the esteemed ranks of the Greatswords, he is required to swear an oath never to take a backwards step in the face of the enemy. Every regiment of Greatswords has its own particular punishment for those who fail in their duty. However, such instances are extremely rare, and the history of the Empire is replete with heroic tales of regiments of Greatswords that have died to a man to protect the life of their liege lord, even after the rest of their army had been butchered.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh_main_unit_long_text_emp_helblaster_volley_gun	The Helblaster Volley Gun is one of the most infamous black-powder weapons ever invented, its devastating firepower able to tear apart an entire regiment in a crackling volley of ear-splitting reports. The Helblaster Volley Gun is the lethal creation of the deranged Engineer, von Meinkopt, and the terrifying reputation of this weapon has spread to all corners of the Old World. Its nine separate barrels are divided into three 'decks' and are turned by the means of a central crank, which means that it can unleash devastating hails of shot that shred its unfortunate target in a firestorm of leaden death. The serious disadvantage of the Helblaster is that it is notoriously prone to jams, misfires and explosive malfunctions. As a result, Helblaster crews are a morbid lot who tend to be paid up with the Priests of Morr.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh_main_unit_long_text_emp_helstorm_rocket_battery	The Helstorm Rocket Battery was inspired by a particularly impressive fireworks display. Early prototypes blew apart an entire floor of the Imperial Engineers School, but the soot-blackened Engineers persevered and succeeded in creating a deadly, if unpredictable, weapon. The shrieking rockets fired by this bizarre machine are wildly inaccurate weapons that have little chance of hitting anything other than (eventually) the ground. However, when these rockets do land on target, the results are devastating; entire regiments are blown apart by a series of earth-shaking explosions. After Elector Count Boris Todbringer was almost killed by an errant barrage, they were dubbed 'Helstorm' rockets after the colourful language used to reprimand the unfortunate crewmen.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh_main_unit_long_text_emp_karl_franz	The Emperor is Karl Franz, Prince of Altdorf and Elector Count of Reikland. Karl Franz is said to be the greatest statesman the Old World has ever seen. He is also a military genius and a valiant general. The Emperor frequently takes personal command of his soldiers, wielding Ghal Maraz, the fabled hammer of Sigmar, like the Warrior God of old, smiting enemies of the Empire with every blow. Karl Franz often rides to battle on the back of Deathclaw, reputed to be the mightiest Imperial griffon that ever lived. A powerful bond exists between the beast and its master, one forged in countless battles and many adventures. During the Battle of Blood Keep, Deathclaw stood over the prone form of the wounded Emperor for three hours, slaying any who came near until the Reiksguard could hack a path to their fallen Lord.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh_main_unit_long_text_emp_light_wizard	The Wizards of the Light College – commonly known as Light Wizards – are rarely seen without treasured tomes and arcane scrolls in hand. Light Magic is renowned for its powers of protection, yet a Light Wizard can also conjure blazing lights to blind and burn the enemy. However, this magical lore is the hardest to master, for the Wind of Hysh is particularly diffuse. To compensate, the Order employs many acolytes to aid its more senior Wizards – an unusual occurrence amongst the Colleges, for the Wizards of the other Orders rarely take on more than one apprentice at a time.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh_main_unit_long_text_emp_luminark_hysh	A Luminark of Hysh is a large and complex magical war machine created by the Wizards of the College of Light Magic. Each consists of an array of enchanted mirrors and aether-lenses, resembling the innards of a vast magical telescope mounted atop a great wheeled platform. These mystical weapons are crewed by a pair of Acolytes - students of the Patriarch of the Light College himself - who tend to the machine's array of precision instruments. As the Acolytes set about focussing lenses, tilting prisms and polishing mirrors, they continuously intone spells to channel the Wind of Hysh. As the invocations gain in tempo and volume, the Orb of Sorcery at the machine's core glows with increasing ferocity until a blinding white light leaps through the Luminarium's arcane optics, manifesting in a destructive beam of soulfire so intense that it vaporises anything in its path.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh_main_unit_long_text_emp_mortar	Mortars are short, heavy weapons, designed to lob a hollow, explosive shell high into the air so that it drops onto its target. While a solid cannon ball may plough through several victims, a Mortar shell explodes with tremendous force, scattering razor sharp shrapnel over a wide area and scything through whole ranks of enemy warriors. Firing a Mortar is always a tense moment, for the quality of fuses is highly variable and it is not unknown for one to burn through before the crew have finished loading the shell. As a result, Mortar crews tend to be superstitious and carry a large number of good luck charms about their person.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh_main_unit_long_text_emp_outriders	Outriders are both the commanders and drill instructors of the Pistolkorps. They are rarely noblemen, but are usually veterans, elevated from the ranks of state regiments who have shown an affinity for horsemanship and a talent for training new recruits. Outriders typically wear ornate armour, for nobles pay well for their sons to learn the art of war. They tend to form separate regiments to display their martial skills to any noble looking for an experienced instructor to tutor their sons. As the Pistolkorps is funded in part by the Imperial Engineers' School, Outriders are equipped with deadly repeater handguns, capable of unleashing devastating storms of lead at range.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh_main_unit_long_text_emp_pistoliers	Pistoliers are young nobles who are not yet old or experienced enough to test their spurs in battle or join one of the Knightly Orders. However, the clarion Call-to-Arms pounds strongly in the veins of these youths, and many cannot wait to march to war and prove themselves on the glorious field of combat. Some spirited young nobles may gather their friends and form regiments of Pistoliers of their own, but most join the ranks of the Pistolkorps, a military organisation funded by the Emperor, the Engineers' School and sponsored by several Knightly Orders. Here, the nobles learn about horsemanship and war from the Outrider - grizzled veterans paid by the Knights to train their sons. Most of the young men who survive their time in the Pistolkorps go on to join a Knightly Order and put the skills and scars they have earned to good use as a fully armoured Knight.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh_main_unit_long_text_emp_reiksguard	The Reiksguard Knights are the personal army of the Emperor. As an Elector Count, the Emperor also has direct command of his own provincial army - which in the case of Karl Franz are the regiments of Altdorf and the Reikland - but it is the Knights of the Reiksguard that form the symbol of his military strength. As befits their prestigious role and elite status, the Knights are equipped with the very finest weapons and suits of armour available. They ride fine destriers to war and the suits of gleaming plate armour in which they are clad are emblazoned with symbols of allegiance to the Emperor. Although few in number, the Reiksguard Knights are the most important part of the Emperor's army, for they are a symbol of the Empire's nobility and martial might. As such, when a unit of Reiksguard Knights takes to battle, it will typically form up proudly in the centre of the Empire battle line, the better to inspire the common soldiery and reassure them that the blessing of the Emperor is with them. 	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh_main_unit_long_text_emp_state_troops	State troops of the Empire are paid as full-time professional soldiers, ready to answer the call to arms at all times while also serving as city guards, the fire watch, and the enforcers of the law. Every state trains its regiments to provide each other with mutual protection on the battlefield, marching to battle with detachments of differently armed troops to aid one another. Swordsmen fight shoulder to shoulder with Spearmen, the close-range parries and ripostes of swords complimenting the longer reach of the spear. Handgunners and Crossbowmen fell their foes with withering volleys of fire while detachments of Halberdiers cut down any who survive such salvos with heavy bladed pole arms.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh_main_unit_long_text_emp_steam_tank	Steam Tanks are monstrous, smoke-belching creations that rumble towards the enemy, firing deadly cannonballs from their steam-powered guns. A thick, armoured skin protects the whole Steam Tank and the advance of these iron behemoths is terrifying to behold; arrows and sword strokes rebound harmlessly from hulls and enemy warriors and crushed beneath their immense bulk. Steam Tanks are armed with a steam-powered cannon that can fire a spinning ball of iron whirling into the foe's ranks. A turret-mounted steam gun is also standard, which can engulf nearby enemies in great gouts of scalding steam.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh_main_unit_long_text_emp_warrior_priest	The Cult of Sigmar demands that its followers fight all forms of evil with martial feats as well as with faith, so many of its priests accompany the Empire's armies as they march to war. In this role, they not only lead and inspire troops in battle, but also minister to their spiritual well-being. Warrior priests are clad in ceremonial vestments and armour adorned with symbols of holy hammers, twin-tailed comets and other religious icons. They shave their heads as a sign of devotion and they carry all manner of strange fetishes made of iron, wood and bone. Many Warrior Priests further adorn themselves with scrolls detailing war oaths and parchments written in the blood of martyrs.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh_main_unit_long_text_emp_witch_hunter	Judge, jury and executioner combined, a Witch Hunter will use any means necessary to burn out heresy from the heart of the Empire. Not a twinge of doubt softens the knife-sharp edges of a Witch Hunter's soul; his bleak existence allows no room for foibles such as compassion or mercy. Indeed, they are often feared even by the innocent, as it is said that a Witch Hunter would sooner raze an entire village to the ground then see a single worshipper of Chaos go free. And yet for all the heartlessness and cruelty of this dark brotherhood, the Empire needs men of this calibre - men who will put aside their own humanity in order to punish and destroy those who embrace dark sorcery or the temptation of Chaos. Such is a Witch Hunter's duty, and it is a burden lesser men would find impossible to bear.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh_main_unit_long_text_grn_arachnarok_spider	The darkest forests of the world are the home to the Gigantic Spiders. These venomous creatures grow to an enormous size, sucking the life juices out of prey and leaving behind only skin-husks and bones. A full-grown Gigantic Spider is larger than a Troll, and its whole body is protected by chitinous armour plates. All Gigantic Spiders have a poisonous bite that is used to paralyse their prey. Only the most foolhardy would attempt to seek them out, and Forest Goblin Shamans, with their spectacular lack of common sense, fit well into that category. A gifted Shaman, touched by the Spider-god's blessings, will not be turned into a lifeless husk, but instead may be rewarded with a clutch of spiderlings. This foul brood - each spider already the size of a horse's head - can be reared and trained. When fully grown, these Gigantic Spiders are prized as revered mounts for a Goblin tribe's mightiest warriors.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh_main_unit_long_text_grn_azhag	Azhag is a threat like no other. After discovering a mysterious magic crown amidst the ruins of a long-forgotten city, the Orc quickly rose to ascension in his tribe. Rivals were easily beaten, as the crown whispered fell plans to him. It is true Azhag has not always fully understood many of its suggestions, and often the sinister headdress uses a vocabulary beyond the grasp of an Orc Warboss. Yet its plans always work to perfection, with countless battles seeing Azhag lead his tribe to resounding victory each and every time. Many Greenskins find Azhag’s erratic behaviour "not right", but as long as they are fighting and winning, such peculiarities are tolerated. As word of his deeds spread, more and more Orcs and Goblins travel to join the erratic but brutal Azhag the Slaughterer.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh_main_unit_long_text_grn_black_orcs	Black Orcs are the biggest, meanest and strongest of all Orcs. They get their name from their dark green or black skin, although the title is just as much derived from their dour demeanour. Black Orcs are grim and singularly focused on war - an occupation they take extremely seriously. It can truly be said that Black Orcs live to fight. In this regard all Black Orcs treat other Greenskins, even the more battle-worthy types, such as Boar Boyz, as little more than frivolous amateurs. This is largely because lesser Orcs, even the hulking Big 'Uns of the Orc tribes, are likely to squabble amongst themselves instead of concentrating on the foe. This lack of discipline is a shortcoming that Black Orcs neither forget nor forgive. The Black Orcs' opinion of Goblins is even worse, seeing them as beneath contempt and not fit to carry spare equipment, much less fight.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh_main_unit_long_text_grn_doom_diver_catapult	The height of the Doom Diver can reach is largely dependent on the quality of his hand-stitched leather wings and, perhaps even more importantly, how far back his crew can pull him on the sinew. It has been known for over zealous types to pull the entire device from its mounts - but more often than not the Doom Diver is stretched back to the limits of the crew's strength and let go with a loud TWANG! Ripping skywards like a bullet, the Doom Diver reaches cloud level before beginning his dive. Using his wings, the gobbo spirals and guides himself towards the chosen target. As the downward descent gains speed, most Goblins emit a high-pitched scream that grows louder and more irritating as it plummets earthwards. With worrying rapidity, the black speck in the sky expands into the plunging Doom Diver. When the Goblin finally impacts, the Greenskin himself might splatter altogether or, if he has effectively applied his wings as brakes and is a bit lucky, he might bounce. Either way a Doom Diver is likely to cause considerable damage to any foe he lands upon.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh_main_unit_long_text_grn_forest_goblin_spider_bows	The giant spider breed grows large enough to serve as mounts for Forest Goblins, who capture and hand-rear these scuttling nightmares. There are many sub-types of giant spider, such as Tilean Greybacks, Drakwald Mancatchers, and the Scarlet Deathheads of the Great Forest, to name just a few. All are poisonous and have steely, pincer-like mandibles that can punch through platemail to deliver a toxic bite. While not as fast as wolves or horses, these spiders can move at speed through the most dense patches of woods. Forest Goblin Spider Riders have become masters at stalking their prey, nimbly guiding their multi-legged beasts to scuttle across the treetop canopy to get into the ideal position before pouncing. Spider Rider mobs are known to ambush Empire patrols, eradicate Beastmen herds and even attack large monsters that encroach into their territory.	false

unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh_main_unit_long_text_grn_giant	To most Greenskins, a Giant is a bellowing, cursing display of raw might, ruthless aggression and really large stompy feet - all things that make Orcs and Goblins break out into raucous cheering. There are few sights more inspiring than watching one of "da big fellas" stomping an enemy into paste. Some even earn a degree of fame and notoriety, such as "Little Gork", so named because he was once hit in the face by a stone from a Grudge Thrower and has since believed himself to be Gork, painting himself green before each battle for effect. For their part, Giants are happy to join an army of Greenskins, as it significantly increases their chances of eating regularly and getting their hands on strong liquor. Amidst the endless battles, if an odd handful or two of Goblin happens to get scoffed along the way, no one seems to mind - it's just considered part of the rough and tumble of Greenskin life.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh_main_unit_long_text_grn_goblin_archers	Goblins gather in great numbers under the tyranny of an Orc leader, or in widely-varying tribes of their own. Regardless of whether a Goblin is a lackey under the heel of a domineering Orc or the member of a distinct tribe, they make for lacklustre troops. However, Goblins can defeat an enemy through sheer weight of numbers, especially if they can attack from a flank or even better from behind. Goblins prefer to attack defenceless foes and shooting arrows from a distance is likewise a popular type of attack among their kind.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh_main_unit_long_text_grn_goblin_big_boss	Orcs determine their hierarchy in a simple manner - the biggest and best fighter takes control. Goblins follow a less straightforward path to the top ranks, as they are both more devious and more cowardly than their brutish Orc cousins. Underhanded ploys and strategy are the preferred tactics for Goblins; although straight-up fighting is still an option, it is one that is typically left to the especially desperate. All Goblins use dirty tricks, with the best schemers being the most dangerous of their diminutive kind and the most likely to rise through the ranks. Those Goblins that make it to the very top are known as Warbosses or Warlords, although some of the more outlandish tribes might use more localised names such as a Wolf-khan, Grand Despot, Potentate, Bogtator, Chieftain-king or Great Grif.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh_main_unit_long_text_grn_goblin_great_shaman	A Goblin Shaman's spells are weedy and irritating, but dangerous - just like Goblins themselves. While Orc Shamans tend to be seen as trance-addled buffoons, Goblin Shamans are cagey and cunning, if no less odd. They often use their magic to barter for tribal influence. Many Goblin Shamans work their way into a top position, either directly advising the Warboss or even taking the command role themselves. Any Greenskin that opposes a Goblin Shaman is apt to suffer nasty rashes, mysterious beetle infestations or some other wicked malady. In battle, Goblin Shamans turn their spiteful spells towards slaying, or at least annoying, the foe. These spells are more subtle than their larger kin's, but no less effective. When an enemy fails to charge because they have doubled up with itchy hives, or the weapons of the Greenskins seem to dart unerringly for weak spots in a foe's armour, it is often due to the magic of a Goblin Shaman.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh_main_unit_long_text_grn_goblin_spearmen	Goblins gather in great numbers under the tyranny of an Orc leader, or in widely-varying tribes of their own.

unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh_main_unit_long_text_grn_goblin_wolf_bows	Goblin Wolf Riders are dangerously fast, able to outride all other beasts save perhaps the swift steeds of the Elves. Some Wolf Rider mobs use bows to fill their enemies with arrows. They lope into range, unleash a hail of arrows, and then retreat before the foe can respond. Wolf Riders often harass the flanks of oncoming troops, but have also been known to charge into smaller (and more vulnerable) units such as war machines and enemy scouts. Other Wolf Rider mobs are more heavily armoured and these Goblins will dare to lower their spears and attack larger formations, howling as they crash headlong into enemy troops. However, it is often said that the snarling wolves are more formidable foes than the Goblins who ride atop their shaggy backs. More than one Warboss has found out that "dog boyz" are not always reliable, finding Wolf Riders as quick to leave the battlefield as they are to launch an attack.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh_main_unit_long_text_grn_goblin_wolf_chariot	It wasn't long after they first started using giant wolves as cavalry that Goblin armies began to field wolf-drawn chariots. Cobbled together out of crudely hacked wood or scavenged materials and lashed tight with gutstring cords, all Greenskins hold such rickety constructions in high regard. To be able to rumble across a battlefield mounted atop a chariot is a clear sign of importance. Many tribal Chieftains prefer to ride in chariots, trying to outdo their rivals by fielding the fastest and flashiest contraption.	false

unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh_main_unit_long_text_grn_grimgor	Even for a Black Orc, Grimgor's thirst for war was exceptional. If a single day went by without a battle, Grimgor was known to start camp-decimating arguments, his one good eye blazing with eagerness to find fault and start a good scrap. Two days without a battle and Grimgor would smite anything he could reach, save (perhaps) his fellow Black Orcs. No one knows for sure what would happen if three days without a battle ever occurred, but even scarred veterans tremble just to think of it. This unquenchable thirst for battle is a sign that marks out a Warboss for leadership, a sign that the Orc is favoured by Gork (or Mork). In a hulking Black Orc with unmatched fighting skills and ferocity it has marked out Grimgor for greatness; the prophet and harbinger of Gork (or Mork).	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh_main_unit_long_text_grn_nasty_skulkers	When it comes to discovering underhanded advantages, Goblins are always seeking some new kind of dirty trick, be it a chance to sneak attack a foe or gang up on a crippled enemy. Some Goblins excel at darting forward and stabbing at an enemy's soft spots before slinking away. It is almost magical the way that they seem to pop out of nowhere - striking from between a comrade's legs or leaping out of the shadows "all stabby like". Such devious gobbos are known as Nasty Skulkers and are generally thought to be "a bad piece o' work", even by shifty Goblin standards. Once a Nasty Skulker has latched onto an enemy unit, he will plague it, slitting throats and jabbing groins until he is found out and stomped to death.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh_main_unit_long_text_grn_night_goblin_archers	Night Goblins are well suited to their subterranean existence. They range in size, but many are on the stunted side, which better enables the spiteful creatures to move quickly through the tight cavernways below ground. Night Goblins are easily marked out from other Greenskins as they wear long, dark, hooded cloaks, in part to blend in with the poorly lit tunnels but mostly to protect themselves from the hated sunlight should they venture above ground. Given a choice, Night Goblins only leave their underground lairs at night or when the sun is shrouded by cloud or gloomspell. When they do emerge, Night Goblins launch deadly raids, ambush travellers in mountain passes, and commit countless other malicious deeds. They are particular enemies of the Dwarfs, and the two races share a long history of bitter battles on mountainous peaks and below ground.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh_main_unit_long_text_grn_night_goblin_shaman	Night Goblin Shamans wear the easily-recognised hoods of their kind and are known for being particularly crazed due to eating vast quantities of hallucinogenic mushrooms. They are especially knowledgeable about fungus and only Night Goblin Shamans know the full rituals for growing, picking and preparing the deadly madcap mushrooms that can turn a Night Goblin into a ball-wielding Fanatic. It is said that a Night Goblin Shaman who eats too many mushrooms will eventually turn into a Shamanshroom, a magic-saturated fungal shoot. It is a damp, dull life as a mushroom, but it will probably get worse; as Shamanshrooms are highly coveted by other magic-casters, getting turned into one is surely a one-way ticket to being eaten alive.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh_main_unit_long_text_grn_night_goblin_squig_herd	Cave Squigs are found far beneath the World's Edge Mountains. They are improbable creatures, part-fungus and part-flesh with spheroid bodies, beady eyes and gaping maws dominated by row upon row of dagger-like teeth. Night Goblins hunt Cave Squigs for a number of purposes. Squig hide is very useful and Squig meat is considered a delicacy. Some are captured and reared to become guard creatures or pets to affluent Boss-types (no other could afford to feed such voracious beasts). In times of need, Squigs are driven into battle to devastating effect. When all goes well, a Night Goblin Squig Herd can chomp through any opposition. When it goes wrong, such as when all their Night Goblin Herders are slain, the remaining Cave Squigs quickly disperse. Driven mad by noise and prodding, Cave Squigs are eager to scatter in all directions, snapping at anything in their way, including other mobs on their own side. Night Goblins, being a bit deranged, don't seem to mind such a risk - as long as it is somebody else being bitten in two by suddenly rampaging, wild Cave Squigs.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh_main_unit_long_text_grn_night_goblin_squig_hoppers	Once, in a reckless mood, a Squig Herder dared to leap upon the back of one of his catches. Driven to new heights of fury by the unexpected rider, the Cave Squig responded by bouncing with unflagging enthusiasm. The rider flailed about, screaming in a high-pitched manner while desperately holding on. This provided great entertainment and the remaining Herders cheered and cackled every time the Squig unseated its unwanted guest. Although the incident ended with both Squig and rider skewered atop a wickedly sharp stalagmite, it was an impressive enough spectacle to inspire the onlookers. Thus the tradition of riding atop Squigs was born and the first mob of Squig Hoppers soon followed. When the living balls of muscle, teeth and claws actually manage to bounce into the enemy, they deliver quite a blow. Squigs use their gaping maws and prodigious strength to gouge and tear, often biting victims in two. Their riders are far too preoccupied with clinging on to add their own meagre contributions. This doesn't stop some Night Goblins from bringing along clubs or weapons, but these are mere props brandished when bragging about their (mostly fictitious) heroic deeds.	false

unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh_main_unit_long_text_grn_orc_arrer_boyz	Some Orcs carry bows. These Orcs, known as Arrer Boyz, are viewed suspiciously by the rest of da boyz, for archery is considered a bit "Gobliny". As Arrer Boyz can prove their prowess in combat, such oddities can be overlooked. Still, it is best not to camp next to Arrer Boyz, as a hail of arrows periodically pincushions passers-by. Yelling rude names at Arrer Boyz is a proven way to alleviate camp boredom and the start of many a good ruckus. Arrer Boy Bosses are notorious dead-eye shots that often order their mobs to keep shooting corpses long after their foes have fallen as "it's good practice".	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh_main_unit_long_text_grn_orc_big_uns	In many tribes the largest Orcs band together into a mob that is accurately, if not imaginatively, called the "Big 'Uns". These warriors are bigger, stronger and even fightier than regular Orc Boyz. Those that survive their stint with the Big 'Uns often go on to become Bosses, Big Bosses, or even Warbosses. In the meantime, they form an elite unit that quickly gains the reputation of being the hardest-hitting mob in the tribe - a claim they are only too eager to show off to any foes or rivals that get in their way. Only one mob can "be da best", so Big 'Uns are mercifully rare in each Greenskin tribe!	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh_main_unit_long_text_grn_orc_boar_boyz	Most Orc Boar Boyz mobs have colourful titles - "Da Tuskers", "Snortin' Wreckas", "Line-Smashas" and so on. Many bear crude board imagery on their banners and shields, depicting tusked skulls, bloody hoofs, and the like. When not carried in battle, such gear of war hangs atop the stockade pens that enclose the war boars. It is common practice to stack any trophies, like severed heads or enemy banners, around the boar enclosure. Boar Boyz take advantage of their elite status, lording it over all other Greenskins save leaders and Black Orcs. It is natural in some tribes for a mob of Boar Boyz to develop into Big 'Uns. The combination of especially large and powerful Orcs atop war boars makes for even more devastating charges and, not surprisingly, even greater swagger and bravado around the Greenskin camp.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh_main_unit_long_text_grn_orc_boar_boyz_big_uns	The war boar is a stubborn and vicious animal that stands nearly as tall as a horse and is considerably bulkier. It is an extremely tough beast that is notoriously bad tempered, loudly flatulent, unpredictable and wholly dangerous. These are just the sort of qualities that Orcs greatly admire, so it was only natural for them to adopt war boars as their mounts. When the beasts lower their tusks and charge, they can crack open a battle line as easily as a well-placed choppa blow can tear apart a foe's rib cage.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh_main_unit_long_text_grn_orc_boar_chariot	By lashing together rough-hewn logs, Orcs are able to construct formidable chariots. It takes two powerful war boars to pull such a blocky construction and, at first, even these thick-muscled beasts struggle. With some grunting and not just a little straining flatulence, the boars finally get the crude wheels turning. Once the churning porcine legs have the chariot rumbling along at full tilt, it becomes an impressive shock weapon, capable of slamming into the enemy with the force of a thunderbolt, albeit a hairy and stinky one. If the sheer impact of such hurtling force does not smash the foe, there are always the iron-shod wheels with crude blades attached, the goring tusks of the boars or the spear thrusts of the Orc crew themselves. While not as fast as a wolf-drawn Goblin Chariot, the heavier Orc vehicle hits harder and in return can absorb considerably more punishment than the flimsier gobbo-crewed devices.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh_main_unit_long_text_grn_orc_boyz	Orcs, often known as Orc Boyz or just "da boyz", are the hard-fighting infantry found at the heart of most Greenskin tribes. Goblins are more prolific, but it is the Orcs that do the bulk of the bloody work in most battles. That is okay with all parties, as Orcs are a warrior race and there is nothing they like half as much as a good scrap. In fact, it is hard to get Orcs to stop fighting. They are an overly pugnacious lot and if no one else is around they will pummel each other just to keep their spirits up. Luckily, Orcs do not register pain as do other races. A typical green-skinned lout won't let a minor injury, such as a severed limb, keep him from fighting. Orcs are so tough and resilient that if the arm can be found and sewn back on (however crudely) it will heal quickly. Orcs naturally take their robust physique for granted and regard everyone else as weak, puny or "squishy".	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh_main_unit_long_text_grn_orc_shaman	An Orc Shaman is a living conduit to Gork and Mork and can wield such arcane might that even the cruellest old Warbosses have to be impressed. The power of a Shaman comes not just from the Winds of Magic, or "da Great Green" as Greenskins know it, but also from the raw energy radiated by their fellow Orcs. As they advance into battle, the Waaagh! energy rises, allowing a Shaman to focus that force through the power of his mind. What erupts out of the Shaman are spells as brutal as the Orcs themselves. Shamans have been known to cause a foe's brains to burst out of his skull, to shoot death beams out of their own beady eyes or to summon an almighty green foot from the skies to stomp and squish any unfortunate enough to be caught underneath it. By using the awesome powers of Greenskin magic to destroy an enemy, Orc Shamans earn the right to their eccentricities.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh_main_unit_long_text_grn_orc_warboss	Orcs are led by the biggest and brawniest of their kind. These hulking individuals have pummelled their way to the top in a culture where only the strongest survive. Orc leaders do not rise above the knock-down brawls so common amongst their race, they thrive on them - at least until they are toppled by a still mightier challenger. Having established dominance over all competitors, Orc leaders take control of a mob or, if they are strong enough, an entire tribe. Any who question the right of the leader to rule must be slain, driven off or spectacularly beaten into submission.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh_main_unit_long_text_grn_rock_lobber	Orcs and Goblins were introduced to catapults, or “fings wot throw roks”, shortly after they encountered the Dwarfs. Greenskins are not technically minded (particularly Orcs), but they have a great appetite for destruction. Even as boulders splattered their foes, Orcs and Goblins began to wish for some catapults of their own. Since then, the Greenskins have built a plethora of what they generally refer to as “lobbers”. These are deployed either singly or in batteries to soften up enemy formations, smash defensive positions, or to toss those that offend the Warboss very, very far. A great shot, one that pulverises a large amount of the foes or sends body pieces flying particularly high, always raises a rowdy cheer. Most Rock Lobbers are counterweight devices, although some use twisted rope to generate torque. Experiments with Troll-powered devices have been tried, but such creatures tend to eat either the animation or key parts of the machine (or both). Some war engines, especially those that have launched spectacularly bloody shots, are given names, such as the legendary Skull Crusher, Fings Chucker, and Hammer of Gork. The Rock Lobber known as Da Boss’ Bane, named for its habit of landing off target and smashing the tribe’s Warboss, was burned, along with its crew, as a precautionary measure by an unusually bright new leader.	false

unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh_main_unit_long_text_grn_savage_orc_big_uns	It isn't just their appearance that is wild, for Savage Orcs drum and chant themselves into a bloodthirsty rage before a battle. While other Greenskins might find their backward customs odd, all agree that Savage Orcs are ferocious fighters. Once engaged in combat, they beat foes enthusiastically with hefty clubs and stone axes, or stab at them with flint-tipped spears. Some Savage Orcs use bows, firing stone-tipped arrows to fell enemies from afar. They are also known to employ a Big Stabba, a two-Orc team carrying a long spear. This, traditionally, has been used for hunting since the lands were full of enormous reptilian beasts. Back then, Savage Orcs like to recall, "Orcs wuz Orcs and beasts wuz big!" Some tribes can boast of a mob of Savage Orc Big 'Uns, the fiercest fighters often marked with the most outlandish warpaint or bearing a larger number of shrunken heads, bangles or other fetishes.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh_main_unit_long_text_grn_savage_orc_boar_boy_big_uns	Although Savage Orc Boar Boyz wear no armour save an occasional hidebound shield, they are remarkably hard to bring down. These nearly-bare brutes can ride through clouds of arrows and emerge unscathed (although perhaps much angrier). Even in close combat, Savage Orc Boar Boyz can withstand all but the most determined of blows. This is due to their sturdy hides, the thick-muscled, protective mounds of their smelly boar mounts, and their own mystical warpaint. While tough as old boots, Savage Orc Boar Boyz are better known for the prodigious damage they cause when they charge. They crash into enemy units with an unparalleled ferocity - boar tusks, crude axes, or flint-tipped spears that all jab, thrust and stab in a frenetic assault. In their recklessness some Savage Orcs even fight with a weapon in each hand, using their legs alone to clutch onto their mounts. These Savage Orcs are a whirling maelstrom of destruction, hacking and flailing with wild abandon - and Savage Orc Big 'Uns on war boars are more fearsome still!	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh_main_unit_long_text_grn_savage_orc_boar_boyz	Although Savage Orc Boar Boyz wear no armour save an occasional hidebound shield, they are remarkably hard to bring down. These nearly-bare brutes can ride through clouds of arrows and emerge unscathed (although perhaps much angrier). Even in close combat, Savage Orc Boar Boyz can withstand all but the most determined of blows. This is due to their sturdy hides, the thick-muscled, protective mounds of their smelly boar mounts, and their own mystical warpaint. While tough as old boots, Savage Orc Boar Boyz are better known for the prodigious damage they cause when they charge. They crash into enemy units with an unparalleled ferocity - boar tusks, crude axes, or flint-tipped spears that all jab, thrust and stab in a frenetic assault. In their recklessness some Savage Orcs even fight with a weapon in each hand, using their legs alone to clutch onto their mounts. These Savage Orcs are a whirling maelstrom of destruction, hacking and flailing with wild abandon!	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh_main_unit_long_text_grn_savage_orcs	It isn't just their appearance that is wild, for Savage Orcs drum and chant themselves into a bloodthirsty rage before a battle. While other Greenskins might find their backward customs odd, all agree that Savage Orcs are ferocious fighters. Once engaged in combat, they beat foes enthusiastically with hefty clubs and stone axes, or stab at them with flint-tipped spears. Some Savage Orcs use bows, firing stone-tipped arrows to fell enemies from afar. They are also known to employ a Big Stabba, a two-Orc team carrying a long spear. This, traditionally, has been used for hunting since the lands were full of enormous reptilian beasts. Back then, Savage Orcs like to recall, "Orcs wuz Orcs and beasts wuz big!" Some tribes can boast of a mob of Savage Orc Big 'Uns, the fiercest fighters often marked with the most outlandish warpaint or bearing a larger number of shrunken heads, bangles or other fetishes.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh_main_unit_long_text_grn_skarsnik	Skarsnik is the chieftain of the Crooked Moon tribe and the most powerful Night Goblin in the World's Edge Mountains. All of the surrounding Greenskin tribes acknowledge Skarsnik's overlordship of the peaks, valleys and upper levels of the ruined Dwarfhold of Karak Eight Peaks. Through devious machinations and relentless spite, he has risen to command in the midst of the bitter and ongoing three-way battle between the Greenskins, Dwarfs and Skaven. A merciless opponent, Skarsnik is forever devising new traps with which to lure his enemies to their doom. His mere name kindles incandescent rage in Dwarfs; it is said that the abominable deeds of Skarsnik have gained their own chapter in the Book of Grudges, but the Dwarfs are not alone in hating Skarsnik. The Skaven have made innumerable pacts with the Greenskins, only to find themselves double-crossed by arguably the shrewdest Night Goblin ever. Skarsnik orders heaps of Skaven skulls stacked into grim monuments to demoralise his ratmen foes. Queek Headtaker, second in command and Right-Claw to the Grand Ruler of Clan Mors, has cowed to place the head of Skarsnik on his trophy rack. Not a day goes by in Karak Eight Peaks without some plot, probing raid, ambush, assassination or full-scale assault. Yet still Skarsnik rules supreme. By the light of flickering candles made of Dwarf-fat, Skarsnik sits on his iron throne and plots yet more wicked schemes of conquest.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh_main_unit_long_text_grn_spider_hatchlings	The darkest forests of the world are the home to the Gigantic Spiders. These venomous creatures grow to an enormous size, sucking the life juices out of prey and leaving behind only skin-husks and bones. A full-grown Gigantic Spider is larger than a Troll, and its whole body is protected by chitinous armour plates. All Gigantic Spiders have a poisonous bite that is used to paralyse their prey. Only the most foolhardy would attempt to seek them out, and Forest Goblin Shamans, with their spectacular lack of common sense, fit well into that category. A gifted Shaman, touched by the Spider-god's blessings, will not be turned into a lifeless husk, but instead may be rewarded with a clutch of spiderlings. This foul brood - each spider already the size of a horse's head - can be reared and trained. When fully grown, these Gigantic Spiders are prized as revered mounts for a Goblin tribe's mightiest warriors.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh_main_unit_long_text_grn_trolls	Trolls live alone or in small groups, and roam desolate regions, preying on travellers and attacking isolated villages. Bands of Trolls often latch onto Greenskin tribes, attracted by the profusion of carcasses and refuse. Some are even thrown the odd Snotling or captive - the Greenskins do this to encourage the Trolls to stick around, for they are handy in a scrap. Trolls can maul any foe, but are so dumb it is hard to get them to follow orders. Savvy Warbosses know that without help the brutes seldom remain focused on the battlefield. Left on their own, Trolls are easily distracted and, instead of attacking, will stoop down to eat the injured or simply stand and drool. Only by barking commands himself, or by tasking a Big Boss to lead the Troll pack, can a Greenskin commander come close to relying on the hulking creatures. Even this shepherding isn't foolproof and some Trolls have been known to tune out a Warboss' yelling in order to eat rocks or pull up offending patches of grass. However, should the creatures reach combat they flail about with their mighty fists or makeshift weapons to lay waste to just about anything. Trolls also have the disturbing ability to retch up the contents of their stomachs. This noxious attack sprays semi-liquid bile and half-digested bits all over its victim, melting through armour and searing away flesh and bone - it is, truly, an ugly way to die.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh_main_unit_long_text_grn_wurrzag	Wurrzag Ud Ura Zahubu is a Savage Orc Shaman of mighty mystical powers. Known as "Da Great Green Prophet", he is guided along his path by the Greenskin gods. He leads tribes to greatness before wandering off to pursue yet another mad plan to advance Orc-kind. Wurrzag's green crusade began in the Southlands when, with the magical energy that arched uncontrollably out of his eyes, he transformed the former Shaman of the Bone Nose tribe into a Squiggly Beast. As the tribe prepared to ritually eat Wurrzag for this deed, the marinated Orc entered a trance and spouted a tale of long ago, when the now-sorry Bone Nose tribe ruled the lands. The cold-blooded ones came and built great pyramids, driving the tribe away and destroying their idols. Since those shameful days, the tribe has lived under a curse. Wurrzag rekindled their spirit of conquest and, filling in for their transformed Shaman, led the Bone Nose warriors to level the nearest Lizardmen-city. Using the rubble of the wrecked pyramid, Wurrzag ordered the Greenskins to erect two edifices. To this day these same stone-faced idols watch over the Bone Noses, and the tribe's fortune has grown.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh_main_unit_long_text_vmp_banshee	Tomb Banshees constantly howl in remembrance of the forbidden pleasures of the life that was once theirs and in bitterness for the peace of the grave that they cannot attain. Their grief-stricken wails can be lethal to mortals and strike terror into the hearts of all who hear them. Those who do not have a will of iron can die of sheer fright upon hearing the mournful screams of the Tomb Banshees. Blood trickles from their ears and fills up the whites of their eyes as the mind-wrenching shriek takes its supernatural toll. Fully-armoured Knights collapse lifeless from their saddles and whole ranks of infantry fall lifelessly as the Banshee does her evil work.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh_main_unit_long_text_vmp_black_coach	Legend has it that the driver of a Black Coach is a Wraith of some kind, and that grisly Nightmares pull it to war. On the battlefield, it feeds on magics wielded by sorcerers both mortal and ever-living. Driven on by the undying will of the Vampire couched within it, the Coach crushes or scythes down the ranks of the enemy without slowing. By creating a Black Coach, the Vampire's retainers can transport their master's rejuvenating form to places of slaughter. This allows the Vampire to revivify himself, drinking in the coalescing energies that swirl around the crucible of war. Each Black Coach is a magnet for such baleful forces; as it drives onward, it draws in the energies of the battlefield, shimmering with sorcerous power until it is all but unstoppable.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh_main_unit_long_text_vmp_black_knights	In the times before the Empire, there were few domesticated horses, and horsemen were exceedingly rare. In most tribes, a steed was a symbol of wealth and status. So it was often that only a Chieftain and his closest warriors would ride mounted into battle, the wealthiest of their number clad in crude iron plate and carrying stout shields. When these early Knights died, their horses were ritually killed and buried in the barrows alongside their masters, to carry them in the afterlife. Many centuries later, the Vampire Counts are known to summon forth the gruesome remains of those ancient Knights in order to bolster the masses of lesser Undead minions under their control. As a Vampire stalks through barrows and mausoleums, Dark Magic swirls invisibly around him like a cloak, probing and penetrating the cracked and overgrown porticos of each resting place and saturating the bones of the armoured corpses within. A thousand years of dust shifts and dissipates as the parchment-dry cadavers twitch and sit upright. In a morbid mockery of their old lives, these Black Knights stir into motion, tearing themselves free of thorny creepers and thick cobwebs, cold fingers clamping around the hilts of age-blackened blades. Alongside them, the skeletal remains of their steeds jerk to Unlife, twisted by magic into hellish mockeries of the noble beasts they once were.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh_main_unit_long_text_vmp_cairn_wraiths	Cairn Wraiths are hooded, spectral creatures that dwell in the realms of nightmare, haunting the dreams of men. They are amongst the most dreaded of all Undead. Lacking physical forms altogether, they cannot be out down by axe, sword or hammer blow. Even the strongest faith cannot banish such creatures easily. Worse still, the icy touch of a Cairn Wraith drains the essence of mortal men. A Cairn Wraith is capable of reaching into the body of an adversary and closing its freezing claws around the victim's vital organs, sending painful chills right through a man's soul. Because they are impervious to physical weaponry, only the raw energies of magic or a well-placed blow from an enchanted weapon can slay a Cairn Wraith. The crippling fear that arises from having a night-unkillable spectre scythe down any too slow to escape causes even brave men to quit the field. Those who do resist the urge to flee find their return blows passing through the Wraith's incorporeal form. It is well that such creatures are so rare, for these silent assassins are quite capable of slaughtering their way through an entire garrison over the course of a single moonless night.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh_main_unit_long_text_vmp_crypt_ghouls	Crypt Ghouls are ugly, stooping creatures with only a vestigial sense of reason. Their skin is sallow and filthy, their eyes are bestial and insane, and their snarling lips reveal sharp-pointed teeth in slavering mouths. Dressed only in the rags they pull from their victims, the Crypt Ghouls carry weapons they have picked up or have crudely fashioned from the remains of their unwholesome meals. These skulking fiends do not need such implements to kill, however, for they have long claws sufficient for their needs. These claws are encrusted with grave-filthy and decaying meat; those that take even the lightest scratch from their talons can die from unnaturally potent infections that spread through the victim's body. In addition, their constant diet of rot-fouled meat confers a sinewy and unwholesome resilience.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh_main_unit_long_text_vmp_crypt_horrors	Crypt Horrors are only seen openly in times of war, where they are primarily used as the shock troops of ambitious Strigoi Ghoul Kings. Crypt Ghouls are counted amongst the lowliest of all Vampiric servants; after all, they lack even the common decency to be properly dead. So the sight of pack of Crypt Horrors accompanying a Vampire to battle is evidence of the terrible depths that their master has sunk to in his quest for survival. In order to create a Crypt Horror, a Vampire must open his veins to a Ghoul and allow it to gulp down his precious blood - essentially a pale bastardisation of the Dark Kiss - an act that is reviled by those who count themselves amongst the elite of Sylvanian society. In battle, packs of Crypt Horrors muscle their way towards the front lines, eyes glowing with dire light. They used shattered gravestones, tomb statuary and cemetery railings to smash aside those brave enough to stand before them, but it is their meat-encrusted fangs and talons that are to be avoided at all costs. Even a shallow wound from a Crypt Horror bears enough poisonous rot to kill a horse. Despised by the living and the dead alike, Crypt Horrors are creatures to be truly feared.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh_main_unit_long_text_vmp_dire_wolves	Dire Wolves are macabre parodies of the living Giant Wolves that roam the Badlands and the forests of the Old World. Their flesh hangs in tatters from cracking bones, their skulls and innards exposed through tears in their skin. They are swathed in an eerie, glimmering twilight and their eyes glow with unnatural energy. The stench of putrefaction hangs on their wet breath and their howls cause shivers of fear to freeze the bold. When they are slain, their bodies dissolve into a coiling miasma, leaving nothing behind. Vampires sometimes keep the largest of these creatures in pens deep below their castles and towers, feeding them on local peasants until they are large and glutted, then goading them to new heights of viciousness. The Vampire imbue their creations with Dark Magic to increase vitality and bestow a callous cunning. These monstrous creations are known as Doom Wolves, and it is these larger, more ferocious beasts that lead the Dire Wolf packs to war.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh_main_unit_long_text_vmp_fell_bats	With a body as long as a grown man, Fell Bats are a fearsome sight. They are darker than midnight and silent as death, even when in full flight. In fact, the only noises that Fell Bat makes on the hunt are horrible gobbling slurps when it sinks its distended mouth into living flesh. In truth, a Fell Bat bears as much resemblance to an ordinary bat as a maddened lion does to a domestic cat. Those who have encountered them, and lived, tell how they hunt with unerring accuracy, swooping down to knock Knights from their saddles or pick off lone warriors unawares. Vampires view Fell Bats much as a Bretonnian Lord might his prized hunting falcons. Precious sweetmeats are offered to Fell Bats from the ramparts of the Vampire's fortress, but to harness an entire flock, a grander sacrifice must be made. A fresh victim, belly-slit and screaming, or a terrified messenger sent to run into the night with his eyes put out is more to their taste. Once they have the scene of gore, they will fall upon the enemy battle line with bloodthirsty intent.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh_main_unit_long_text_vmp_grave_guard	Upon the walls of Drakenhof Castle, and the other Vampire-haunted keeps of Sylvania, patrol tireless warriors clad in rust-gnawed armour. These dread sentries are the Grave Guard - Wights drawn from their ancient tombs to act as guardians for the Vampire rulers of Sylvania. Although their bodies have decayed, leaving only bones and tattered flesh, Grave Guard are held together by evil magic so strong that it has endured for centuries. They wear ancient battle gear of primitive alloy, corroded by time and dusty with the years. These eerie, silent sentinels stand constant vigil on the crumbling battlements and at the iron-bound gates, never resting, eternally ready to defend their Vampire masters. When a Vampire marches forth, his Grave Guard advance at the head of the Undead host. They form a formidable corps of warriors, their enchanted blades cutting down the toughest of enemies with strike after pitiless strike.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh_main_unit_long_text_vmp_heinrich_kemmler	Heinrich Kemmler burns with the need for power. Having recognised the limits that mortality placed upon him in his early years, Kemmler made it his life’s work to escape them. He plunged into the world of Necromancy as a young man, and by the time he had reached his fortieth year he was able to raise entire graveyards of corpses to do his bidding.\\n\\nKemmler became a great and much-feared Necromancer, plundering every Wizard’s tower and ancient temple he could find in his search for dark truths. His star was in the ascendant for many decades until ambitious rivals united to bring him to his knees. Although he finally managed to scatter his attackers with a great spell of confusion, Kemmler’s body was broken and his mind blasted in the battle.\\n\\nFor many years Heinrich wandered as little better than a half-sane beggar. By some quirk of fate, he uncovered the tomb of a long-dead Chaos Champion, whose burial mound was so magnificent it towered high above him. Here Kemmler struck a terrible pact with the Gods. They restored him to his former power and in return, Heinrich swore to slay and destroy in their name. Now, the name of the Lichemaster once again strikes terror into the hearts of ordinary folk.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh_main_unit_long_text_vmp_hexwraiths	The origins of the Hexwraiths are shrouded in mystery, but it is said that they are created on Hexensnacht, tearing their way into the mortal realm from the very bowels of the underworld. Their single-minded purpose seems to be the pursuit of those evil men who have cheated their rightful fate, for a Hexwraith's shade-like existence leaves it with a hunger that only the succour of a damned soul can sate. Once the curse of the Hexwraiths has been laid upon their prey, there can be no escape - the spectral horsemen can hurtle across rivers and pass through mountainsides on their incorporeal steeds without slowing their headlong charge. In recent years, the Vampires of Sylvania have learned to bind these creatures of shadow to their service, using them as weapons of war. The sight of a pack of cackling Hexwraiths approaching fast, spirit scythes held high and unnatural soul-fires flickering from their eye sockets, is enough to chill the blood of even the most seasoned warrior. It is small wonder that these deathly riders are amongst the most feared of all the minions of the Vampire Counts.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh_main_unit_long_text_vmp_manfred_von_carstein	While Vlad von Carstein was the most physically powerful of the Vampire Counts, Mannfred was the most cunning. When Vlad was slain, Mannfred did not involve himself in the infighting that would see Konrad rise to prominence. Instead, he travelled far and wide, seeking to deepen his knowledge of Necromantic lore. He made an unholy pilgrimage to the ancient tombs of the Nehekhara and the ancient city of Lahmia, where he wrested the secrets of the Liche Priests from bone-dry papyrus and scrolls made from human skin. Mannfred also studied the ancient spells in the first of the Books of the Dead. Eventually, his journeys took him to Nagashizzar. None can say what foul bargains Mannfred made with that surreal realm's inhabitants in return for forbidden knowledge. When Mannfred finally returned to Sylvania, he was more powerful than ever, and took over the Undead legions in the wake of Konrad's destruction. Mannfred was almost as masterful as Vlad at concealing his true nature. As he sought for allies, Mannfred would travel abroad in the guise of an Imperial lord. He was always courteous to those he met on his travels, as befits a noble from a powerful family. When Mannfred revealed himself at the height of his power, his appearance was far more horrifying - his face became contorted and corpse-like, and his scalp writhed with magical energy. Yet his newfound powers were not enough. In the end, Mannfred was defeated and his army annihilated at the Battle of Hel Fenn. Some storytellers claim that Mannfred is not vanquished. They say he rode from Drakenhof against the forces of Chaos when they invaded the Empire. If Mannfred has survived, then surely he will reveal his designs for the Imperial throne.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh_main_unit_long_text_vmp_master_necromancer	As a man follows the dark path of the Necromancer, he becomes ever more detached from his mortal roots. Morbidly questing after the secrets of death, a Necromancer deeply steeped in the lore of the dead stands on the threshold between worlds, neither wholly alive, nor one of the Undead. His body twisted with unholy power, his mind seared by the horrors he has witnessed, a Necromancer often has more in common with his lurching, moaning minions than with the living he seeks to slay.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh_main_unit_long_text_vmp_necromancer	Necromancers are amongst the most cursed of all those who practice the magical arts, for they have exchanged their humanity for the ability to raise the dead and command them to wage war upon the living. Strange as it may seem, these depraved madmen have made this dread pact willingly. At the heart of each Necromancer's morbid obsession is the need to subjugate and punish those who have persecuted him in the past, regardless of the cost.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh_main_unit_long_text_vmp_skeletons	Beneath the mud lie the grave-stained bones of bitter, ancient warriors. Long held beneath the earth, they are clad in their corroded armour, their lifeless hands still gripping the swords, axes, spears and shields they held in life. Provided their remains have not been blessed by the rites of Morr, a Necromancer or Vampire can use the coiling energies of Dark Magic to instil a semblance of life and a flicker of spirit into these dormant warriors. As the regiments of past massacres claw their way to the surface, their empty eye sockets glow with unholy power. Silently, they gather together in a semblance of their old ranks, mutely awaiting the commands of their new lord as the remains of their tattered banners flap in the unnatural breeze of their creation. Lipless horn blowers raise their instruments and sound a spectral, mournful dirge.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh_main_unit_long_text_vmp_terrorgheist	In death, a Terrorgheist becomes a nightmare made real. Guided by its master's will, the monstrosity creaks through the clouds above the battlefield on blotch-skinned pinions, its rotten flesh and withered organs open to the night air. Clotted hanks of fur cling in patches to its skeletal neck, and its skull swings from side to side as it tracks its prey on the plains below. It is the deathly shriek of an Unliving Terrorgheist that is perhaps its most fearsome aspect. As the magics of Undeath are worked upon the beast, its cry is transformed from a simple but shockingly loud noise into a barrage of eldritch power. Some say the Terrorgheist's shriek is nothing less than the screams of the damned, channelled directly from the Realm of Chaos. It matters little to the Terrorgheist's prey, for so devastating is its sonic attack that is can cause a man to die of fright in an instant. By venting this unholy noise as it drives down upon its prey, a Terrorgheist can cripple an enemy regiment moments before it slams into the reeling survivors, slaughtering the rest with tooth and claw.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh_main_unit_long_text_vmp_vampire	Vampires are the true masters of Undeath. Despite their curse, Vampires retain all of their devious intelligence, and hence all of their ambition and desire. This makes them very dangerous indeed, for they can continue to grow and learn, spending eternity perfecting their skills and honing their diabolical plans and schemes. A Vampire is ultimately a selfish creature who retains many of the traits and drives she possessed when mortal. Whilst the crudest of their kind exist only to feed, some lust after temporal power and conquest of the living. The Necrarchs strive to attain unparalleled Necromantic skills, whereas Lahmnians possess immense wealth beyond the dreams of avarice. The greatest curse of Queen Neferata's legacy is that Vampires cannot live on normal food and drink, but must imbibe fresh blood for sustenance. For the youngest Vampires, this unnatural thirst is very strong. At this stage, they are often rash and easily caught and killed by Witch Hunters and other dedicated enemies of the night. Though most learn how to survive on less and less fresh blood until they need to feed only every few years, some never overcome their primal hunting instincts.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh_main_unit_long_text_vmp_vampire_lord	As a Vampire ages, his powers increase. He becomes physically stronger and faster, until he is able to tear a man in half and move as fast as the wind. He is able to call upon a host of powers, the nature of which vary from Vampire to Vampire. Some can call forth creatures such as wolves and bats to assail the armies of the living, and sometimes they can even learn how to change into these forms. Others are able to mesmerise weak-willed mortals with barely a glance. If the Vampire has a strong affinity for magic, then his Necromantic abilities expand both naturally and through study. Despite these awe-inspiring powers, however, there is a terrible price to pay. As the decades become centuries, many Vampires lose their minds, sliding inexorably into madness.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh_main_unit_long_text_vmp_vargheists	Vargheists are the darkness in a Vampire's soul made manifest. They are towering winged humanoids, each several times the size of a man. Though the Vargheists once walked and talked as lords amongst the chattel, these curse-born Vampires have devolved into ravenous predators desperate for the taste of blood. They prowl the battlefield in packs, ready to pounce upon the least sign of weakness and tear a hole in the enemy ranks with crimson claw and bloody fang.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh_main_unit_long_text_vmp_varghulf	A Varghulf has a monstrous body, swollen by a constant diet of red meat. Unbound by human form, a Varghulf is a contorted mass of packed muscle, giving it the strength to crush a chariot or bowl over entire ranks of those stupid enough to try and pen it in. Powerful legs and broad wing-flaps allow Varghulfs to chase down their kills in swift, gliding leaps, and they can lash out at enemies around them with shocking speed. They use their immense claws to strip flesh from bone, the better to suck at the juicy marrow of their prey. A Varghulf's main weapon, however, is a wide mouth filled with dagger-like fangs capable of puncturing armour and crushing skulls. In battle, the Varghulf becomes a whirlwind of rage. Though voracious and unpredictable killers, Varghulfs are far from mindless. They do not possess the aptitude or inclination for sorcery of their Vampiric cousins, but their presence still acts as a conduit for Dark Magic, and they are able to reknit themselves with the raw stuff of Necromancy should they suffer injury.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh_main_unit_long_text_vmp_wight_king	Wight Kings are incredibly powerful Undead, almost as hard to destroy as Vampires. Suffused with Dark Magic, a Wight King's weapons shimmer with baleful energy. The merest touch of their spear tip or blade can drain the life from their foes, or slice through flesh and bone with an ease that is frightening to behold. Clad in ancient armour, their flesh all but withered away, there is little for an adversary to cut or stab. Even to stand before one of these skeletal warriors of antiquity takes an extreme effort of will. For these reasons, a Vampire will often charge a Wight King with carrying forth the Undead general's personal banner. Such a duty is often integral to the army's stability, and these indomitable Undead warriors are able to hold aloft the army standard whilst tirelessly striking down one foe after another.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh_main_unit_long_text_vmp_zombies	Zombies are shambling horrors that stagger towards the enemy battle lines in a noisome horde. Grotesquely reanimated corpses, they are compelled by the Dark Magic of a Vampire or Necromancer, and driven by the will of their master to commit acts of extreme violence. To call the way a Zombie attacks "fighting", is perhaps to give the foul creature credit beyond its due. These sickening half-things have no skill to speak of, but are instead driven only by the insatiable urge to rend, kill and consume the living. Any warrior unfortunate enough to be pulled down by a Zombie horde will find himself torn slowly apart by a mass of desperate clawing fingers, his flesh gouged from his body in grisly, glistening chunks. The fortunate die quickly, but those unlucky souls who are trampled beneath the horde spend their death throes in miserable agony as their innards become a crimson feast.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh_pro01_unit_long_text_dwf_grombrindal	Grombrindal is an enigmatic figure, recorded throughout the Dwarfs' history, appearing to give aid to his bearded kin whenever they find themselves in a particularly dire and unfavourable situation. Just what can one Dwarf do when a Karak is besieged by thousands of Greenskins, or a Dwarf throng surrounded and outnumbered by a warherd of braying, ravenous Beastmen, however? In Grombrindal’s case, it turns out that he can do quite a lot; the White Dwarf is a mighty warrior, some say bettered only by Grimnir himself. Every slash of his legendary axe see the heads of urks tumble from their dishonourable shoulders.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh_pro02_unit_long_text_vmp_isabella_von_carstein	As the daughter of the last Count von Drak, Isabella carries in her veins true nobility, laced with supreme arrogance and cruelty. Though her union with Vlad von Carstein was at first a marriage of convenience, love soon blossomed - a love that was to see Isabella ushered into the ranks of the Midnight Aristocracy, granting them both the power to realise their dreams. Isabella's newfound ability to raise the dead, coupled with her undying devotion to her husband, means the von Carsteins are more than a match for their enemies. With the Chalice of Bathori in hand, and Vlad at her side, there are few in the Old World who can stand against Isabella von Carstein!	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh_pro03_unit_long_text_vmp_krell	Krell was a mighty Chaos Champion in the days before Sigmar’s birth, the ruler of a barbarian tribe corrupted by the Chaos God, Khorne. Krell carved out an empire amongst the northern tribes before turning against the Dwarfs to the south. His name is recorded many times in the Great Book of Grudges, though he was eventually slain by the Dwarf Hero, Grimbul Ironhelm, during the assault on Karak Kadrin. Krell’s followers carried off his body to be buried in a barrow tomb, where it was found almost 1500 years later by Nagash during his searching for the Crown of Sorcery. Translating the runic inscriptions, the Necromancer set about raising this prized hero to fight in his armies. Much devastation ensued until Nagash and Krell were eventually brought to battle by Sigmar and his Dwarfen allies at the Battle of the River Reik, where Nagash was slain and his forces were all but destroyed. Although Krell and his Grave Guard fought their way off the field, Sigmar tracked, defeated and killed him at Glacier Lake. The Warrior-God entombed Krell’s body in a magical prison, where he remained until the Lichemaster Heinrich Kemmler freed him some centuries later. Naturally, Kemmler believes Krell to be his servant, forgetting that the Chaos Champion once served Nagash – allegiance to whom is not so easily broken…	false
