rituals_description_wh2_dlc12_ikit_nuke_rite		false
rituals_description_wh2_dlc12_ikit_workshop_doomflayer_part_0	Nicknamed "Doomballs", these dangerous micro-replicas of the Doomsphere provide Doom-flayers with a potent but unpredictable power source.	false
rituals_description_wh2_dlc12_ikit_workshop_doomflayer_part_1	Mechanical flaying is a complex business; a Doom-flayer’s parts need constant analysis to stay in sync and to maximise power.	false
rituals_description_wh2_dlc12_ikit_workshop_doomflayer_part_2	Allows the Warlock Masters to 'plug-in' to their Doom-flayers, redirecting some of the Warp-energy to their own bodies.	false
rituals_description_wh2_dlc12_ikit_workshop_doomflayer_part_3	What happens when you stick foldable blades onto the ones you already have? An inescapable maelstrom of screaming, agonising, flaying death! Ouch!	false
rituals_description_wh2_dlc12_ikit_workshop_doomflayer_part_4	Equipping a Doom-flayer with a set of motorized whirling blades gives it the ability to deflect incoming projectiles.	false
rituals_description_wh2_dlc12_ikit_workshop_doomflayer_part_5	Warpstone-powered incendiary devices triggered around the Doom-flayer are effective countermeasures against anything thrown at them... which is typically an awful lot!	false
rituals_description_wh2_dlc12_ikit_workshop_doomflayer_part_6	The secret recipe for this black stone alloy results in blades that get sharper and sharper the more they cut and slash.	false
rituals_description_wh2_dlc12_ikit_workshop_doomflayer_part_7	Similar to the Doomwheel's 'Meat Shields' technique, putrid flesh is used to assault the enemy’s senses as a method of distraction.	false
rituals_description_wh2_dlc12_ikit_workshop_doomflayer_part_8	Rigorous testing has shown that penetrating these reinforced, serrated armour plates is near-impossible without damaging the penetrating weapon.	false
rituals_description_wh2_dlc12_ikit_workshop_doomflayer_part_9	An iron ball of death is more effective the less it is dragged down by resistance – be that by wind, blood, flesh, or bone!	false
rituals_description_wh2_dlc12_ikit_workshop_doomwheel_part_0	These components allow a cyclical energy transfer between the scurrying rats powering the Doomwheel and its Warpstone generator, leading to incredible power surges.	false
rituals_description_wh2_dlc12_ikit_workshop_doomwheel_part_1	Adding these to a Doomwheel's Warpstone generator allows a Warlock Master to overcharge its power output to unpredictable levels.	false
rituals_description_wh2_dlc12_ikit_workshop_doomwheel_part_2	A portable power system used for keeping other Doomwheel systems operational when the scurrying rats are at full automotive capacity.	false
rituals_description_wh2_dlc12_ikit_workshop_doomwheel_part_3	Allows Warp Lightning bolts to be split with a stunning 200% efficiency, using a technique likely 'acquired' from the Luminarks of Nuln.	false
rituals_description_wh2_dlc12_ikit_workshop_doomwheel_part_4	Using these curiously-designed parts, power transfer can occur at impossible speeds, leading to even more devastating zappers.	false
rituals_description_wh2_dlc12_ikit_workshop_doomwheel_part_5	Fitted to Doomwheel bolt-throwers, these allow Warp-energy to be briefly stored before firing, making for more concentrated attacks.	false
rituals_description_wh2_dlc12_ikit_workshop_doomwheel_part_6	Smells like rat-bile mixed with crude oil, but few things are better for keeping engine parts moving – just don’t ask how it’s made.	false
rituals_description_wh2_dlc12_ikit_workshop_doomwheel_part_7	These parts have long been scavenged from Dwarf-things' Gyrocopters – with modifications, they can also afford the Doomwheels more killing-mileage!	false
rituals_description_wh2_dlc12_ikit_workshop_doomwheel_part_8	Blending metallurgy, alchemy, and sorcery results in the best armour you can possibly forge. Smells toxic, but what doesn't on a Doomwheel?	false
rituals_description_wh2_dlc12_ikit_workshop_doomwheel_part_9	Tying up some slaves and suspending them around the Doomwheel provides some level of grisly protection – just keep the flesh fresh!	false
rituals_description_wh2_dlc12_ikit_workshop_gatling_part_0	Research into new bullet designs yields interesting results; all that's needed now is an assembly line of slaves to painstakingly mass-produce them.	false
rituals_description_wh2_dlc12_ikit_workshop_gatling_part_1	This new-fangled invention for ammunition replenishment enables on-the-spot conversion of metal scraps into bullets.	false
rituals_description_wh2_dlc12_ikit_workshop_gatling_part_2	The hotter a Ratling Gun gets, the faster it can fire, but the more liable it is to overheat. Coolant solves this problem.	false
rituals_description_wh2_dlc12_ikit_workshop_jezail_part_0	The Skaven do not have great eyesight, so the sniping ability of Warplock Jezzails benefits greatly from immensely powerful telescopic scopes.	false
rituals_description_wh2_dlc12_ikit_workshop_jezail_part_1	A costly method of manufacturing bullets results in this all-purpose ammunition, effective against all types of armour whenever within killing range.	false
rituals_description_wh2_dlc12_ikit_workshop_jezail_part_2	Invisibility is seemingly a step too far, so the Engineers of Skryre shall devise something they claim is just as good.	false
rituals_description_wh2_dlc12_ikit_workshop_nuke_part_0	A giant labyrinth of pumps, valves, turbines, and generators, all submerged in an ominous cloud of green steam. Here, Warpstone’s power is harvested.	false
rituals_description_wh2_dlc12_ikit_workshop_nuke_part_1	In the filthy caverns of the Under-Empire, the potential for mass destruction shall silently sit, stockpiled until the moment of explosive grandeur.	false
rituals_description_wh2_dlc12_ikit_workshop_nuke_part_2	Devising new 'waste-not, want-not' methods will make even the most degraded or poisonous waste materials processable for Warp-fuel production.	false
rituals_description_wh2_dlc12_ikit_workshop_nuke_part_3	Test subjects are prodded, stabbed, shot, zapped, burnt, dematerialised – you name it. If it causes pain or death, it probably happens here.	false
rituals_description_wh2_dlc12_ikit_workshop_nuke_part_4	Warpstone ore is quite unusable in its crude state, needing processes of separation and purification before being in any way useful.	false
rituals_description_wh2_dlc12_ikit_workshop_nuke_part_5	Give the Doomrockets an extra 'kick'. The enemy’s going to feel this one!	false
rituals_description_wh2_dlc12_ikit_workshop_poison_wind_globaldier_0	Larger enemy-things can endure globadiers' poisoned winds. But if laced with needle-thin Warpstone shards, even the thickest skin would provide no defence.	false
rituals_description_wh2_dlc12_ikit_workshop_poison_wind_globaldier_1	If Warpstone gas is passed through a Hell Pit Abomination before bottling, its potency increases dramatically. The specifics of this procedure are best left... undiscussed.	false
rituals_description_wh2_dlc12_ikit_workshop_poison_wind_globaldier_2	Bombardiers may be fragile, but the Wyrdstone fumes which envelop them are a powerful deterrent. With the right distillation, terror will grip any nearby foe.	false
rituals_description_wh2_dlc12_ikit_workshop_poison_wind_mortar_0	The giddying effect of poisoned winds slows the work of Skaven mortar crews. Regularly inhaling these air-globes will grant fresh speed to tired paws.	false
rituals_description_wh2_dlc12_ikit_workshop_poison_wind_mortar_1	Warpstone gas rakes flesh, but a strong mind might endure the agony unless the brew is infused with an unspeakable offal found only in the Plague Monks' rancid cells...	false
rituals_description_wh2_dlc12_ikit_workshop_poison_wind_mortar_2	As if their lives were not already short and painful from exposure to poison winds, elite mortar crew are forced to stitch focus-enhancing Warpstone gems into their eyes.	false
rituals_description_wh2_dlc12_ikit_workshop_warpfire_part_0	A double-barrelled flamethrower has two uses – preventing the weapon from overheating and shooting enemies approaching from two different directions!	false
rituals_description_wh2_dlc12_ikit_workshop_warpfire_part_1	Whether handling dangerous materials in the lab or wielding chemical-spewing weaponry in the field, protective attire is always a boon!	false
rituals_description_wh2_dlc12_ikit_workshop_warpfire_part_2	With pump designs haphazardly copied from the Dwarfs, the Warpfire Throwers will squirt their toxic filth further than ever before!	false
rituals_description_wh2_dlc12_ikit_workshop_warpgrinder_0	When a Warpstone drillbit is flanged with pillaged Gromril, fashioned into crude rat-claw shapes, even the very rock is liquified by its unstoppable passage. 	false
rituals_description_wh2_dlc12_ikit_workshop_warpgrinder_1	Legend tells that any Clanrat brave - or foolhardy - enough to snort this pain-blocking Warp-powder will see the face of the Horned Rat himself. 	false
rituals_description_wh2_dlc12_ikit_workshop_warpgrinder_2	Given sufficient exposure to Warpstone spun at burning speeds, damaged Skaven flesh can knit itself back together. But only briefly. Stand clear when the effect fades…	false
