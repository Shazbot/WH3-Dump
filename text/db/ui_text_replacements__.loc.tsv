ui_text_replacements_localised_text_battle_playstyle_description_wh_main_sc_brt_bretonnia	Bretonnia specialises in riding down their foes with powerful heavy cavalry.

ui_text_replacements_localised_text_ie_loading_screen_theatre_badlands	The desolate and unforgiving Badlands are so named for good reason. They are notorious for the numerous Greenskin tribes that prowl their wastes, not to mention the degenerate remnants of defeated warbands and droves of bandits, criminals, and worse. They are made even more inhospitable by the harsh and unforgiving landscape, littered with storm-tossed boulders and the rubble of long-dead empires. A traveller does not have to go far here before stumbling upon a ruin or a cairn… or an untimely and undoubtedly violent end!	false
ui_text_replacements_localised_text_ie_loading_screen_theatre_border_princes	Demarcated from the Empire by the towering Black Mountains, the Border Princes’ lands are ruled over by a loose association of fiefdoms and robber-barons. To this lawless place come those who are unhappy with the status quo overseen by the Emperor and his Elector Counts, leaving for a "better life" in the Borderlands. Often what is found, however, is a land more dangerous than their previous homes, where petty princelings war on each other, farmsteads are raided by marauding Greenskins or skittering ratmen, and bloodthirsty pirates from Sartosa come looking for plunder.	false
ui_text_replacements_localised_text_ie_loading_screen_theatre_bretonnia	The vast, forbidding forests and frowning valleys of the Empire may be lacking in fair Bretonnia, but behind this safe facade, peril lurks. The sprawling lands between the dukes’ centres of power are home to all manner of predators, from wolves, through to Goblins, Orcs, Undead, and the like. Beyond the kingdom's borders the Elves of Athel Loren exist as an enigma to their neighbours; a fragile coexistence that, for now, aids the cause of all in these lands who stand against the ever-present threat from the Forces of Destruction.  	false
ui_text_replacements_localised_text_ie_loading_screen_theatre_cathay_north	A wonder of engineering and sorcery, the Great Bastion of Grand Cathay has endured throughout the Dragon Emperor’s reign, preserving his ancient civilisation against the horrors of the north. Yet it has not repelled every threat, for within the borders of this great military power lurk infiltrators and pillagers from distant lands, seeking to gain advantage from newfound footholds. There are those who wish to see this empire crumble, so they may profit from the pieces, but for the limitless Daemonic forces of Chaos, annihilation would suffice.	false
ui_text_replacements_localised_text_ie_loading_screen_theatre_cathay_south	The wilderness of the south has few of the great cities seen elsewhere in Cathay, being more sparsely populated the further one travels from the Great Bastion. Yet despite being far from the constant dangers of the northern provinces, these idyllic landscapes still harbour much peril from within and without. From the elevated port-city of Shi-Wu in the east to the mazes of jungles and canyons that dominate the borderlands of Kuresh and Ind, these wild lands are home to undiscovered civilisations which are all but impossible to colonise.	false
ui_text_replacements_localised_text_ie_loading_screen_theatre_chaos_wastes_north	About the Realm of Chaos, the borderlands of the mortal world form a ring of shadow that surrounds the ultimate darkness within. Contrary to the arcane creatures and powerful beings that lurk across this nightmarish landscape, the northern extremes are undoubtedly part of the material world, but inevitably tainted by their close proximity to the Realm of Chaos. Should one travel into the Wastes, they would find themselves labouring beneath a storm-shaken sky, continuing at their mortal peril. Words alone are incapable of describing that which lies beyond oblivion’s veil…	false
ui_text_replacements_localised_text_ie_loading_screen_theatre_chaos_wastes_south	Beyond the waters of the far south lies a vast, unchartered landmass about which little is known and much is speculated. The stories differ from culture to culture – many of the Old World’s better-travelled seafarers say this blasted continent’s plains are visibly littered with the glowing debris of Morrslieb’s birth, while High Elf sailors warn that not even Amanar can protect those who stray too far south from the waters around the Fortress of Dawn. Whatever the truth may be, all heed the warnings pointedly inked onto many a sailor’s map: “HERE BE DAEMONS”!	false
ui_text_replacements_localised_text_ie_loading_screen_theatre_dark_lands	It is for good reason that ships rarely stop along the southern coastlines that provide passage into the desolate Dark Lands. In the distance, past the roving bands of Orcs, Goblins, Ogres, and worse, black smoke can be seen spewing into the filthy sky, though one would be forgiven for thinking this is entirely volcanic in nature. The stench of tar pits and oil pools hangs heavily in the air, hinting at a malevolence that threatens to rise. Thralldom or death are the likely destinies of those ill-prepared to travel northward.	false
ui_text_replacements_localised_text_ie_loading_screen_theatre_dwarfholds	The Golden Age of the Dwarfs has passed, their hegemony over the realm-spanning World’s Edge Mountains now dwindled to a fraction of their former glory. Though a handful of their greatest Holds remain, others litter the slopes in ruin or serve as lairs for those seeking to hold sway over these lofty heights. Up here, only the most stubborn and resilient can persevere – be they Goblin, Skaven, Dawi, or otherwise – while beneath the slopes, echoes of conflict ring throughout the Underway in constant reminder that war is always close.	false
ui_text_replacements_localised_text_ie_loading_screen_theatre_empire	From the icy Sea of Claws in the north to the soaring Black Mountains in the south, the individuality of the Empire’s provinces is much defined by its landscape. Its vast forests provide food and the materials of production, while wide rivers and traversable valleys facilitate trade and transport. Yet at times, the land itself seems to strive against progress, concealing monsters and enemies of all sorts amongst its craggy passes and dark groves. Peril awaits within and without, but the nations of men have thus far proved equal to the challenge…	false
ui_text_replacements_localised_text_ie_loading_screen_theatre_isthmus	Like the Lizardmen whose magic brought them into being, the sentient mountain ranges that demarcate the Isthmus of Lustria from the Dark Elves stand in stoic defence against Naggaroth’s boundless hate. Throughout history, the relative safety of the Isthmus’ bays and inlets have attracted many explorers of the Old World and beyond, with many who have made landfall arriving with futile intentions to pillage Lustria’s temple-cities. Wiser are those who eschew conflict with the cold-blooded locals. Yet such visitors are rare, for few risk the perilous journey across the Great Ocean without a lust for fortune.	false
ui_text_replacements_localised_text_ie_loading_screen_theatre_lustria	For eons, Lustria remained hidden from the outside world, but upon its discovery was quickly deemed to be one of the most hostile regions in the world. It is not just the prehistoric carnivores one needs to be wary of, but also the debilitating parasites, fist-sized insects and lethal florae. Such dangers have not stopped those who wish to plunder its ancient temple-cities, however, though only the hardiest avoid succumbing to the jungle before ever reaching them. To the native Lizardmen, Lustria is a haven – a bulwark against the disorder that has plagued the world since the coming of Chaos.	false
ui_text_replacements_localised_text_ie_loading_screen_theatre_mountains_of_mourn	The Mountains of Mourn are where all Ogres always seek to eventually return, if only to boast to their more sedentary kin about their trails of destruction. It is a brutal domain known for its harsh climate and deadly inhabitants, where in the far north the Chaos Wastes play havoc with the landscape, mutating the local monsters and adding to the dangerous primeval fauna. From its craggy slopes can be seen a murky pall that hangs over the Dark Lands to the west, punctuated by distant glowering of orange flames of sinister origin.	false
ui_text_replacements_localised_text_ie_loading_screen_theatre_naggaroth	The Land of Chill is a bleak and forbidding territory as unforgiving as the Dark Elves who have made it their home. Most in Naggaroth dwell in one of the heavily-fortified cities whose sinister pinnacles rise high into the storm-wracked sky, depraved places where murder lurks in every shadow and the weak are slain for the amusement of the strong. Throughout history, many foolish interlopers have taken on the Druchii on their own barren soil – more often than not, their dead bodies end up nourishing it.	false
ui_text_replacements_localised_text_ie_loading_screen_theatre_nehekhara	Once fertile, populous and prosperous, the Land of the Dead has been ravaged by centuries of war and neglect. Here, the searing heat of the desert sun is the least of any wandering traveller’s worries, for the taint of Nagash’s Great Ritual still lingers from the distant past. In this ghost-haunted realm, countless unquiet spirits and elementals flit around great mortuary temples and dark tombs, their cries heard screaming in the wind. Yet still there are those who would brave this cursed place for causes both righteous and covetous.	false
ui_text_replacements_localised_text_ie_loading_screen_theatre_norsca_and_kislev	With an ill-defined border, the north of Kislev is barely distinguishable from Troll Country and the tundra beyond. The threat from Norsca in the northwest is constant, for it is a land stalked by all manner of gruesome monsters and savage madmen, of infertile ground as hard as iron and howling winds that cut like daggers of purest cold. A network of fjords and mist-shrouded inlets wreathe the Norscan coast, and it is here that the Northmen tether the longships with which they terrorise the shores of the known world.	false
ui_text_replacements_localised_text_ie_loading_screen_theatre_southlands	In the farthest southern reaches of the world, beyond the haunted tomb-cities of Nehekhara, is a land of unspoiled jungle and swamp once isolated from the world for uncounted centuries. More recently the Southlands has seen several of the world’s races sail to its shores, though few leave with anything other than tales of misery and death. Even for those who find a foothold far enough from the interests of the cold-blooded Lizardmen, this is a wilderness where invaders quickly become the invaded, and where hunters quickly become the prey.	false
