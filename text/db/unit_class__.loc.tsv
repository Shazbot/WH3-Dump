unit_class_tooltip_art_fix	Fixed position artillery units that pack quite a punch, they are nevertheless very weak if engaged in melee.	false
unit_class_tooltip_art_fld	With a long range and able to cause great damage, field artillery can be moved slowly around the battlefield, but are very weak if engaged in melee.	false
unit_class_tooltip_art_siege	Huge siege engines perfect for knocking down walls and gatehouses.	false
unit_class_tooltip_cav_mel	Although they are versatile units protected by shields, melee cavalry are weak against more specialised units.	false
unit_class_tooltip_cav_mis	Fast moving and with a long range, missile cavalry are great at harassing their enemies, but weak if pinned down in melee.	false
unit_class_tooltip_cav_shk	The hammer to the infantry of any army, they are devastating when charged into the flank or rear of enemies.	false
unit_class_tooltip_chariot	Fast moving units with a wide turning circle, they can punch through weak enemy units. They are vulnerable if pinned down in combat.	false
unit_class_tooltip_com	These are small units that protect the general whilst he gets on with his job.	false
unit_class_tooltip_elph	There's nothing quite like an elephant to make a hole in an enemy line. Flaming projectiles and javelins are the best way to counter them.	false

unit_class_tooltip_inf_mis	Long range units who provide support for melee units, but are themselves generally weak in close combat.	false

unit_class_tooltip_shp_art	These ships can do a lot of damage from long range, but can be neutralised by boarding and ramming.	false
unit_class_tooltip_shp_mel	Perfect for taking out enemy ships, but have to close quickly and board to be successful. 	false
unit_class_tooltip_shp_mis	Enemy ships can be showered with their projectiles, but they must steer clear of enemy melee ships.	false
unit_class_tooltip_shp_trn	Slow but with plenty of space, they do their job well. Just remember that they aren't warships.	false
unit_class_tooltip_spcl	Nothing says "surprise!" like unleashing animals on the battlefield.	false
