quotes_quote_onscreen_1323793045	Skryre’s most powerful Engineers meld sorcery and science until the two are indivisible.

quotes_quote_onscreen_1553661902	The Skaven are smarter than they look. Don’t mistake them for being stupid - nor for cowards, neither.

In fact, if the Skaven attack, you know you’re in trouble...	false
quotes_quote_onscreen_15826701	Their leader, who was bedecked in feathers, edged towards me. It was I who spoke first: "Salaam, brother, we come in peace!"

quotes_quote_onscreen_1600003644	They don’t feel fear as we do, or if so, they hide it well. I saw one take on a Griffon without hesitation when it came too close to his eyrie, and I’ve heard tell that the mothers will even assault a Dragon if their chicks are threatened!	false

quotes_quote_onscreen_1828754435	So where does it come from? There are those among the more superstitious of our folk and a few foolish Grey Seers that believe Warpstone is the 'leavings' of the Horned Rat. I subscribe to the secular view – that it is chunks of the Dark Moon, Morskrit, gifting us with pieces of its essence. Dangerous it is, to touch Warpstone often. But that’s what slaves are for, yes-yes?	false
quotes_quote_onscreen_1842123076	As the war ground on, the folk of Nagarythe became ever more desperate, relying on the blackest of sorceries and Daemonic pacts. Thus did they come to be known as 'Dark Elves'.	false

quotes_quote_onscreen_1871055270	The only possible way an attacker can carry one of those accursed stone forts is to advance under the heaviest barrage of missiles possible. This is where the Elf forces archieved their greatest successes; the defenders unable to spread out, are ripe for slaughter beneath a cloud of arrows, and cannot deploy much effective missile fire of their own, hampered by the limited arcs of fire within their walls.	false
quotes_quote_onscreen_1871594933	I stood before the gigantic golden statue at last! Here it was, the legendary Golden Serpent, the greatest treasure in all of Lustria. I alone was left alive to see it. How ironic, I thought, that now I had reached the treasure I no longer possessed the means to either break it up or carry it away.I could at least take back a memento...	false
quotes_quote_onscreen_1902394250	A single Skaven, he is a weakling and a coward. Divide and conquer is the watchword here.

quotes_quote_onscreen_1925101158	Awake O dead, for there can be no rest for ye beneath the earth. Let the splintered bones burrow from the grave pall.

quotes_quote_onscreen_1930420756	We do not do it for coin, for there is none. We do not do it for glory, for there is none also.

No, we do it for the screaming of our enemies - and of that, mi amigo, there is a-plenty.	false

Wisely, they fled the beast, but it gave chase and pursued them for many miles. "Surely," said the first Skaven, panting, "we cannot-cannot outrun this horrible creature." The second chittered his agreement. "Nor do we have to," he replied. Unsure of his birthkin’s motive, the first Skaven asked "What do you mean?" By way of response, the second tripped his companion, answering "I-I only need to outrun you!"	false
quotes_quote_onscreen_1963831595	I’ve said all my prayers, offered sacrifices and paid my tithes. My ship is in Manann’s hands now.	false

quotes_quote_onscreen_197530677	Is it possible that the Skaven are no less than a manifestation, a dark and morbid reflection of man's cities, his civilisation, even his fears?

quotes_quote_onscreen_2068477278	Now strangers heed the song of the Brine-Maid, and glimmer they seek as all men may. Multitudes and legions land on sacred shore and make for Lizard-home. I shall steer them to riches beyond dreaming and do mischief to High-Lizard Lordling a-plenty!	false
quotes_quote_onscreen_2092494918	...and storms shall sunder the skies, and war will tear the world apart, and the dead shall rule the lands.	false
quotes_quote_onscreen_2108765834	Manann is our blessing, our patron, the one that brings food to our table. He’s also the one that drags our sons to the bottom of his watery home, the bringer of storms, and the crushing waves. He is the Sea and he is eternal.	false
quotes_quote_onscreen_2111724931	There are great deeds that remain undone, enemies yet to conquer and raptures yet to rejoice in. So, as it is written, so shall it be done. I, Settra, have proclaimed it - let none dare oppose my will! 	false

quotes_quote_onscreen_2127240838	We were fools. The Ark crushed us, and the Druchii picked off the warriors who flailed about in the frothing waters with arrows. Only I survived. There is nothing worth having to the east. Nothing.	false
quotes_quote_onscreen_2129810176	There is wisdom and there is ignorance, and in between are the gateways to eternity through which the Old Ones so long ago passed.	false
quotes_quote_onscreen_213012347	The fact that the Warlock Engineers sell to all sides in the constant Skaven struggle for dominance is well known; the fact that for a very high price they offer to withhold their services is widely guessed. None but the Grey Seers know the exorbitant extent of Clan Skryre's double-dealing and treachery.	false

quotes_quote_onscreen_4592	I take offence at that. Our weapons may not be quite as deadly to our enemies, but that doesn’t mean that our engineering is lesser than the Skaven's. For my money, when a weapon explodes in your hands more often than at the enemy, it’s not much of a weapon at all. Right?	false
quotes_quote_onscreen_4596	We record the passing of the seasons, but we cannot predict them. It is simply how things are. In many ways, this is like life, no? It moves and changes, but who can say when, or how it will happen.	false
quotes_quote_onscreen_4598	They look a lot bigger than you when you’re up close and they’ve got their claws out, especially the big fat ones. But so do Elves and Men. I tell you, Skaven go down a lot easier. All that fur is a ruse - underneath they’re as lean as a Goblin, and just as easily smashed with a good axe-blow.	false
quotes_quote_onscreen_4606	And King Louen did wield the Sword of Couronne, and he did slay the herds of beasts and the tide of green death that threatened the fair land of Bretonnia! It is written, oh yes - it's all here in the finest scribe's hand!	false
quotes_quote_onscreen_4607	Yes, we fought alongside the Bretonnians. One fellow insisted on calling me "serf" even though I had tactical command. Me and some of the lads unhorsed the swine while no one was looking. He probably hasn't learned his lesson though...	false
quotes_quote_onscreen_4612	Apparently, we fight with "peasants' weapons" and "without honour from afar". Whatever, I say, the results speak for themselves - they got chopped up and we reduced the Greenskins to a smelly puddle on the battlefield!	false
quotes_quote_onscreen_4614	An army that seeks to fight without the protection of the Eagle Claws is clearly courageous or inept. Either way, I wish no part in it.	false
quotes_quote_onscreen_4617	...And Orion is consumed by flame, only to be born anew; a cycle of regeneration without end. As he emerges once again, he bears the memories of those who have come before; branded by the flame.	false
quotes_quote_onscreen_4622	Those Knights who swear fealty to the Lady, and to the King, ride to defend what was and what will be again.	false
quotes_quote_onscreen_4624	The Lady, though we owe all to her, is ever fickle. 'Tis only to Bretonnians that she does appear, and yet to Bretonnians she will also withhold her grace, should they ever err or stumble on the path. Such is her unfaltering way.	false
quotes_quote_onscreen_4625	The desire for errantry beats in the heart of every noble Bretonnian but not the peasants, you understand? We feel it in every motion, in every step, in every breath. But the peasants, of course, do not. Obviously.	false
quotes_quote_onscreen_4626	I may be small, but I’m strong. Hell, ten years in a Skaven mine makes you damned strong. If I get in close, I can snap their puny necks like a twig. I could teach you Empire boys a thing or two about it, that’s as sure as mutton.	false
quotes_quote_onscreen_4629	Oh I see them, the Bretonnians. Yes, I see them. In their gilded towers with their shiny banners and their glittering horses. Tosh. Tosh and gaudy nonsense I say! Yet those horses ARE pretty…	false
quotes_quote_onscreen_4634	The Bretonnians? Aye, I know 'em. Arrogant lot, full of fancy ideas about valour and chivalry and what not. Yet they've no love for the grobi, mind you, so that makes 'em a firm friend to the Dawi!	false
quotes_quote_onscreen_4636	Listen up boys. In my experience, there are three types of Skaven: white ones, black ones, and everything else. Some may be big, some small, but all die covered in their own pi...	false
quotes_quote_onscreen_4638	Mousillon was once ruled by a just and even-handed ruler, yet no more. Now that land is blighted; forsaken by the light and all but the most stalwart residents. Death stalks Mousillon, and they call him "My Lord".	false
quotes_quote_onscreen_4643	The true power of Bretonnian martial ability is displayed in towering trebuchets. No walls, nor gate, nor city can stand against the ceaseless strength of these man-made marvels.	false
quotes_quote_onscreen_4646	You suck your thumb and your teeth will stick out! And if you don’t stop, you’ll grow whiskers and a snout, too! Where do you think Skaven come from, hmm? They’re all little boys who sucked their thumbs!	false
quotes_quote_onscreen_4650	Many whisper that the Fay Enchantress IS the Lady herself, but she denies these rumours. All the same, she speaks the Lady's will, and knows the Lady's power. Hers is a strength that supports all of Bretonnia.	false
quotes_quote_onscreen_4653	Their slinking, furred shapes infested the broken city, feasting on the fallen and pulling down the weak... The manlings stood back to back and fought for their lives, but against the implacable ferocity and countless numbers of the verminous horde their weapons were useless. The tide of monstrous rats flowed over them one by one, dragging them down to be torn apart, the yellow chisel-teeth sinking into their soft flesh, the dark-furred mass drowning their pitiful screams with their hideous chattering.	false
quotes_quote_onscreen_4656	Bretonnia is a realm of men, but 'twould be nothing without the steeds that carry them. And no Bretonnian mount is greater than the Pegasus, the mighty wing'ed beast that carries the questing Knights far afield, across impassable terrain with terrifying strength, in the name of the Lady.	false
quotes_quote_onscreen_4660	We tread your path, we fight your fights, we climb the highest peaks and delve into the endless depths. Tells us, Lady, what is it we must do? How best to gain your blessing!?	false
quotes_quote_onscreen_4661	Now that I have seen Lustria with my own eyes I believe the tales are true - both of the gold that can be pried out of every ruin, and also of the denizens of that cursed land. Lizardmen, savage in deed and heart. It matters not the price, I will not return to those forsaken jungles again.	false
quotes_quote_onscreen_4668	So they sent for a witch with a terrible twitch to ask how my future impressed her. She took one look at me and cried, "He, he, he, HE! What else could he be but a jester?" A jester? A jester? A funny idea. No butcher, no baker, no candlestick maker, and me with the look of a fine undertaker impressed her as a jester?	false
quotes_quote_onscreen_4671	Before Elves, before Dwarfs, before Men, the Old Ones arrived upon this world. Then came Chaos and the Great Plan of the Old Ones was unmade. We are the last of their servants, and only by our hand shall the Great Plan be restored, with the total defeat of the usurping younger races.	false
quotes_quote_onscreen_4677	We have political systems like this in the Empire. We call them 'protection rackets'…	false
quotes_quote_onscreen_4678	I’m not sure what those things were, but they fought like cornered... er...	false
quotes_quote_onscreen_4680	The weak Elves of Ulthuan fear us, for our ways are the true ways. They fear what they cannot understand and instead cower behind the lies of their false history. Fools and cowards, it is but a matter of time before we wipe them from Ulthuan and regain our rightful place as masters of that isle. And from there, we shall take the world.	false
quotes_quote_onscreen_4681	What is a Knight without his steed? But what is the steed without his knight? Knight and Steed, noble and peasant; on such relationships is Bretonnia built.	false
quotes_quote_onscreen_4684	All that stuff about Cloaked Brothers is bunk. Like the Skaven, they don’t exist.	false
quotes_quote_onscreen_4688	Our duty is clear. If you cannot stand against them, then we will take a force and destroy these Rat-things that prey upon you. Make way.	false
quotes_quote_onscreen_4691	Bretonnia is fair and peaceful because everyone knows their place. Yours is with the truffle hounds.	false
quotes_quote_onscreen_4694	We shall strike down our foe with sharp steel and cold hearts. The weak die so that the strong shall be spared. Then and only then will our enemies know the true meaning of fear.	false
quotes_quote_onscreen_4702	Manlings will fall! Yes-yes... in time...	false
quotes_quote_onscreen_4712	Dangerous it is, to touch Warpstone often. But that’s what slaves are for, yes-yes?	false
quotes_quote_onscreen_4714	Most precious of all substances, the pulse of our life. If the Horned Rat is our father, then surely, Warpstone is our mother. Its uses are infinite. Like the heart of an endless fire, it is.	false
quotes_quote_onscreen_4715	Our beautiful land is besieged on all sides, but we resist like our fathers did before us. We will emerge victorious and more intractable than ever to these turbulent times when our corrupt brothers come to ravage our shores. We are Asur; the sons of Aenarion and Ulthuan shall never fall. 	false
quotes_quote_onscreen_4717	Sometimes – you might think I’m as crazy as a doom prophet – but sometimes I think those rats are watching me. You know, spying like. Sigmar preserve me, but I don’t like it much. I’d hate to see it if the rodents ever got their way. Still, I get paid for catching a pole-full. Give us another one, Bessie.	false
quotes_quote_onscreen_4725	The hunting of vermin is a task for peasants, not for a Knight of Our Lady.	false
quotes_quote_onscreen_4733	Oh my brothers, what need be said? We are the chosen of our Master, the true Lord of Decay, whose seat remains always-always filled upon the Council of Thirteen. Other seats may change hands, but His will always remain, and no-none other can lay claim to it. We speak His truths. We hear His thoughts. We know His purpose. We are the guides of our people, the spiritual compass that guides-leads them to their destinies as killer-masters of the world.	false
quotes_quote_onscreen_4736	The horrors and the wonders they must have seen, these Phoenix Guard. How I wish they would only speak of it to mortals not gifted with such foresight.	false
quotes_quote_onscreen_4742	To sail with a Black Ark is one of the greatest honours that any Druchii could ever aspire to. I trained long and hard to earn my berth upon the Wind of Damnation, slaying several undeserving rivals to the post along the way. It is a worthy life. I get to regularly practice my skills upon our many enemies and one tenth of the plunder that I seize is mine to keep. Slaves, gold, and fame, these too can be yours if you are bold.	false
quotes_quote_onscreen_4748	You disappoint me, Queek. To be a Lord of Decay is not to stab and kill and smash all things aside. You lack circumspection. You are a killer, nothing more.	false
quotes_quote_onscreen_4749	You were so magnificent when I found you, the biggest in your litter, and they were all large before you ate them. I raised you, I fed you the best Dwarf-meat and Man-flesh. And you have become even more magnificent. Such courage. There is none other like you, Queek. You are unnaturally brave. Others think you freakish for leading from the front, not the back. But I do not. I am proud of my Queek.	false

quotes_quote_onscreen_4760	We are the chosen of Asuryan, beloved of the gods and heirs to the world. Our armies are the finest in creation; swift where our foes are lumbering, cultured where they are barbaric. Give no thought to failure, nor defeat – we are the Children of Ulthuan and we shall prevail.	false
quotes_quote_onscreen_4764	Yes-yes Warlord Krizk – for a treaty-pledge of just 200 Slaves, twelve claws of Warptokens, a Breeder and certain alliances and pledges, one of our very-very finest Clan Moulder Rat Ogres can be yours...	false

quotes_quote_onscreen_601833259	No longer was there a single race of Elves; the civil war had wrought divisions that could never be healed. Now the High Elves of Ulthuan and the Dark Elf exiles were two distinct peoples, united only by their enmity.	false
quotes_quote_onscreen_635591366	You have read the signs as clearly as I. The growing power of Chaos makes no distinction between the living and the dead. Nagash must rise, or our realms of silence will fall. 	false

quotes_quote_onscreen_730420559	They boasted of 14 'Keepers of the Coast', claiming each were recruited in the winter to stand vigil in summer with their boats and militias. I do not believe it. I saw those 'boats'. They were no better than a pile of logs thrown to the ground by a troll.	false

quotes_quote_onscreen_808084617	The armies of the Undead are unlike others. I have faced them many times and they exact a fear-grip on men's hearts in a way no other enemy can. Men are more prone to fear when facing a host of the walking dead, and fear is a soldier's worst enemy.	false

quotes_quote_onscreen_980905120	All decent folk find the common rat repulsive. Harbinger of disease, it scavenges on our waste-heaps and frightens our children. How immeasurably worse then is the foul Skaven - standing on its hindlegs in foul parody of a human. Rats as tall as man, and blessed with the most vile intellect and cunning. They are the dark side of our souls, come to destroy us for our sins.	false
