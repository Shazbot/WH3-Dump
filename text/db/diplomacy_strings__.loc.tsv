diplomacy_strings_string_BRET_Dip_Accept_State_Gift_01	A trinket we shall place with the other baubles in the vaults at Couronne.	false
diplomacy_strings_string_BRET_Dip_Accept_State_Gift_02	It is no Grail… but you have our gratitude. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_BRET_Dip_Accept_State_Gift_03	The worth of such a gift could feed the smallfolk of an entire dukedom for months… we shall place it in the vault. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_BRET_Dip_Acknowledge_Accept_01	I prayed to the Lady for an answer and she deemed it wise. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_BRET_Dip_Acknowledge_Accept_02	The Grail Knights gather - a sign we should accept. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_BRET_Dip_Acknowledge_Accept_03	I saw a vision of Gilles le Breton, he told me to agree to this.	false
diplomacy_strings_string_BRET_Dip_Acknowledge_Cancel_Treaty_01	This is no surprise, yours is a people of no honour. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_BRET_Dip_Acknowledge_Cancel_Treaty_02	Fine. There is no treaty when such foul deeds are abroad! 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_BRET_Dip_Acknowledge_Cancel_Treaty_03	Bretonnia will deal with you no longer! 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_BRET_Dip_Acknowledge_Reject_01	We do not accept this! Bretonnia's honour is worth far more. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_BRET_Dip_Acknowledge_Reject_02	You offend the Lady with this rejection.  	false
diplomacy_strings_string_BRET_Dip_Acknowledge_Reject_03	Fine! Bretonnia weeps at your refusal. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_BRET_Dip_Acknowledge_War_01	The Green Knight comes to my dreams with sword drawn. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_BRET_Dip_Acknowledge_War_02	The Knights sally forth. We are prepared for you! 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_BRET_Dip_Acknowledge_War_03	So be it. We have the Lady's protection! 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_BRET_Dip_Cancel_Treaty_01	Our chivalric code cannot be compromised, this treaty is over! 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_BRET_Dip_Cancel_Treaty_02	The treaty is done, due to your unchivalrous actions! 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_BRET_Dip_Cancel_Treaty_03	We must void this treaty, the Fey commands it. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_BRET_Dip_Demand_Join_War_01	Surely your honour is at stake, you must fight with us!  	false
diplomacy_strings_string_BRET_Dip_Demand_Join_War_02	Join us, and this day will be a red day for our enemy indeed! 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_BRET_Dip_Demand_Join_War_03	Now is the time to fulfil the chivalric code and join us in battle! 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_BRET_Dip_Demand_Payments_Negative_01	A debt must be paid, the Royarch demands it! 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_BRET_Dip_Demand_Payments_Neutral_01	You owe our Lady - pay up, my lord. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_BRET_Dip_Demand_Payments_Positive_01	We do not mean to besmirch your honour, but the debt accrued to Bretonnia is due. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_BRET_Dip_Generic_Offer_Bretonnia_Negative_01	You defile the name of Gilles the Uniter with this display of arrogance!  	false
diplomacy_strings_string_BRET_Dip_Generic_Offer_Bretonnia_Negative_02	You are not worthy of mantle, Knight, yet we must discuss the matter at hand. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_BRET_Dip_Generic_Offer_Bretonnia_Neutral_01	We are all dukes and lords, we will find common ground. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_BRET_Dip_Generic_Offer_Bretonnia_Neutral_02	I have seen the way you treat your smallfolk - far too lenient for my liking. Still, there are matters to attend.  	false
diplomacy_strings_string_BRET_Dip_Generic_Offer_Bretonnia_Positive_01	Come, my lord, we must talk, the Lady deigns it. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_BRET_Dip_Generic_Offer_Bretonnia_Positive_02	We must come together, my lord, let us speak on how best to serve the Lady. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_BRET_Dip_Generic_Offer_Chaos_Negative_01	Bretonnia will never be yours, Northmen. Come, parley and we will tell you why! 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_BRET_Dip_Generic_Offer_Chaos_Negative_02	We will purge your filth from our holy lands, but first a meeting! 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_BRET_Dip_Generic_Offer_Chaos_Neutral_01	There is an offer for you, minion of Chaos, but your fell masters won't like it. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_BRET_Dip_Generic_Offer_Chaos_Neutral_02	We make our demands in good faith, Northman, are your Gods even capable of the same? 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_BRET_Dip_Generic_Offer_Chaos_Positive_01	Should you leave the shores of Bretonnia unmolested, then perhaps an offer can be made. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_BRET_Dip_Generic_Offer_Chaos_Positive_02	We make no pacts with the Chaos Gods - willingly - but perhaps, my Lady sees an opportunity for an offer to be made?	false
diplomacy_strings_string_BRET_Dip_Generic_Offer_Dwarf_Negative_01	Yet again, the Dwarfs look down upon us from the Grey Mountains with faces of scorn. Now it is our turn to look down upon them - we demand an audience. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_BRET_Dip_Generic_Offer_Dwarf_Negative_02	You have little time Dwarf, meet our demands. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_BRET_Dip_Generic_Offer_Dwarf_Neutral_01	Will the Dwarfs consider an audience, or are they too busy counting coin in their deepest vaults? 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_BRET_Dip_Generic_Offer_Dwarf_Neutral_02	We have an offer, if only the Dwarfs deem an ally worth listening to. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_BRET_Dip_Generic_Offer_Dwarf_Positive_01	The Dwarfs are an honourable race, will they hear us out? 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_BRET_Dip_Generic_Offer_Dwarf_Positive_02	Many a battle has been fought with Dwarf and Knight as one - will you hear us now? 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_BRET_Dip_Generic_Offer_Empire_Negative_01	Trouble comes to Bretonnia and, of course, the Empire remains deaf to our pleas for a simple audience. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_BRET_Dip_Generic_Offer_Empire_Negative_02	A curse on Sigmar and his unchivalrous sons - we are Bretonnia and demand you hear us! 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_BRET_Dip_Generic_Offer_Empire_Neutral_01	Does the new Emperor forsake Bretonnia? Or will he hear us out? 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_BRET_Dip_Generic_Offer_Empire_Neutral_02	This is no border skirmish around Axe Bite Pass, we have a proposal. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_BRET_Dip_Generic_Offer_Empire_Positive_01	We humbly suggest that the Prince of Altdorf and his allies take note of this offer. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_BRET_Dip_Generic_Offer_Empire_Positive_02	Will Sigmar's envoys hear the ambassadors of the Lady? 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_BRET_Dip_Generic_Offer_Greenskin_Negative_01	Ugh! I wish nothing more to send your wretched hide back to the Massif Orcal, but first we must talk. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_BRET_Dip_Generic_Offer_Greenskin_Negative_02	We have a proposal, hear us out, Orc-scum, and then you may try and duel me with that crude weapon of yours. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_BRET_Dip_Generic_Offer_Greenskin_Neutral_01	Come, Greenskins, it is hoped you have your uses than merely a thing to spit on our lances? 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_BRET_Dip_Generic_Offer_Greenskin_Neutral_02	We have an offer for you, do you even understand the concept, Orc? 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_BRET_Dip_Generic_Offer_Greenskin_Positive_01	The Lady's protection on us, but I make an offer and wonder if you even have a mind worthy of accepting it? 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_BRET_Dip_Generic_Offer_Greenskin_Positive_02	Do the Orcs not want for anything other than blood? Maybe this offer will change your mind? 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_BRET_Dip_Generic_Offer_Negative_01	The Royal Decree is pronounced - hear it and quail! 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_BRET_Dip_Generic_Offer_Negative_02	Hear us! Your honour demands it! 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_BRET_Dip_Generic_Offer_Negative_03	If you do not offer an audience then the Fey Enchantress shall hear of it! 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_BRET_Dip_Generic_Offer_Neutral_01	We have an offer, blessed by the Lady herself.  	false
diplomacy_strings_string_BRET_Dip_Generic_Offer_Neutral_02	A simple audience is requested, surely you will not sully your honour by refusing to grant us that. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_BRET_Dip_Generic_Offer_Neutral_03	We have a small request, the risks are minimal to you. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_BRET_Dip_Generic_Offer_Positive_01	Our proud Knights salute you, will you give us the same courtesy? 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_BRET_Dip_Generic_Offer_Positive_02	The laws of chivalry state that our hospitality is yours… 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_BRET_Dip_Generic_Offer_Positive_03	We offer greetings, and that your will hear our offer.	false
diplomacy_strings_string_BRET_Dip_Generic_Offer_Vampire_Negative_01	Make no mistake, liche, we despise all your Unliving kind… but the Lady wishes you to know of an offer… 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_BRET_Dip_Generic_Offer_Vampire_Negative_02	Vile breathless corpse-fodder! I sully my honour just being near you! Still I must make this demand upon your master. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_BRET_Dip_Generic_Offer_Vampire_Neutral_01	We wish no repeat of La Maisontaal Abbey… let us be quick and strike a deal. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_BRET_Dip_Generic_Offer_Vampire_Neutral_02	Creature of Mousillon, hear our offer and be gone. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_BRET_Dip_Generic_Offer_Vampire_Positive_01	We are used to dealing with the living dead - our lands have been blighted by your kind since the death of Landuin. Still, I take no pleasure in this meeting. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_BRET_Dip_Generic_Offer_Vampire_Positive_02	We have an offer - you would be wise to accept, for the world is teeming with Dark Lords and won't miss the loss of one. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_BRET_Dip_Offer_Cooperation_01	Perhaps a treaty? 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_BRET_Dip_Offer_Cooperation_02	The Damsels agree, a treaty would be most wise. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_BRET_Dip_Offer_Cooperation_03	We seek co-operation. Unity is our best course, don't you think? 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_BRET_Dip_Offer_Cooperation_Bretonnia_01	Let us make Gilles proud, for a united Bretonnia! 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_BRET_Dip_Offer_Cooperation_Bretonnia_02	The Flower of Bretonnia - our Knights - must work as one. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_BRET_Dip_Offer_Cooperation_Chaos_01	If the Northmen agree, we will cross the bridge that is their inevitable treachery on another day. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_BRET_Dip_Offer_Cooperation_Chaos_02	To have a treaty with Chaos is a mark upon our honour, but a stain can be cleaned off when washed in the waters of the Lady. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_BRET_Dip_Offer_Cooperation_Dwarf_01	Do the Dwarfs still hold honour? I'd wager that they do… 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_BRET_Dip_Offer_Cooperation_Dwarf_02	Join with us, brave Dwarfs, together we can purge our lands and mountains. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_BRET_Dip_Offer_Cooperation_Empire_01	I say to the Empire that now is the time to sign treaties and work for all of mankind. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_BRET_Dip_Offer_Cooperation_Empire_02	We offer a treaty, in good faith, to the men of the Empire. Will the Grand Prince Altdorf, hear us? 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_BRET_Dip_Offer_Cooperation_Greenskin_01	Sign the treaty, Orc, and may it keep your Green Godz in line - though I doubt it. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_BRET_Dip_Offer_Cooperation_Greenskin_02	We offer the Orcs a treaty, I pray to the Lady for their understanding. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_BRET_Dip_Offer_Cooperation_Vampire_01	The Undead are used to pacts and unbreakable vows. It is how their Dark Magic works - perhaps a treaty will shackle them? 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_BRET_Dip_Offer_Cooperation_Vampire_02	Will the Undead lords accept our terms? 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_BRET_Dip_Offer_Gift_01	Here is a token of appreciation. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_BRET_Dip_Offer_Gift_02	It is nothing, a small furbelow to mark our friendship. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_BRET_Dip_Offer_Gift_03	Please accept our gift, and blessing of Shallya. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_BRET_Dip_Offer_Join_War_01	Bretonnia is willing and able! 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_BRET_Dip_Offer_Join_War_02	Our lances are sharp and eager, we will join your cause!	false
diplomacy_strings_string_BRET_Dip_Offer_Join_War_03	It is war, the laws of chivalry demands we act. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_BRET_Dip_Offer_Peace_01	The Lady craves peace with you, her will must be done. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_BRET_Dip_Offer_Peace_02	There is honour in sheathing a sword as well as wielding it. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_BRET_Dip_Offer_Peace_03	Yes, peace - it is a fine thing. For the peasants must return to my farms. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_BRET_Dip_Offer_Peace_Bretonnia_01	We need peace within our borders. The peasants are rioting! 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_BRET_Dip_Offer_Peace_Bretonnia_02	Our nations must be stable, the Lady demands it. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_BRET_Dip_Offer_Peace_Chaos_01	Peace with Chaos is surely an impossible thing, but I must request it anyway. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_BRET_Dip_Offer_Peace_Chaos_02	The offer of peace will fall upon merciless ears, I know, but my Lady asks anyway. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_BRET_Dip_Offer_Peace_Dwarf_01	The Dwarfholds will prosper better with peace between us. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_BRET_Dip_Offer_Peace_Dwarf_02	Let our swords be put on the racks and your beards grow long, for there is no need for war. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_BRET_Dip_Offer_Peace_Empire_01	The fate of the Old World needs the Empire and Bretonnia to be as one. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_BRET_Dip_Offer_Peace_Empire_02	We are all men, and should not be at each other's throats. There is much honour between us and plenty of enemies without. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_BRET_Dip_Offer_Peace_Greenskin_01	Fight amongst yourselves, Orcs, keep us out of this! 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_BRET_Dip_Offer_Peace_Greenskin_02	Do the Greenskins even understand… peace? 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_BRET_Dip_Offer_Peace_Vampire_01	Back to Mousillon with you! Go now and we will not pursue. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_BRET_Dip_Offer_Peace_Vampire_02	We do not wish to fight you anymore, there is no honour in it! 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_BRET_Dip_Reject_Join_Confederation_01	There is no alliance with Bretonnia!	false
diplomacy_strings_string_BRET_Dip_Reject_Join_Confederation_02	We do not need you for this! 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_BRET_Dip_Reject_Join_Confederation_03	We fight for the Lady - you do not! 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_BRET_Dip_Reject_Peace_01	Shallya will not walk here this day, for war calls and Bretonnia answers. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_BRET_Dip_Reject_Peace_02	There can be no peace - the Knights will charge! 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_BRET_Dip_Reject_Peace_03	Your ways are unchivalrous and will be punished!	false
diplomacy_strings_string_BRET_Dip_Reject_Peace_Bretonnia_01	For defying the will of Leoncoeur, you will be chastised. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_BRET_Dip_Reject_Peace_Bretonnia_02	It is you who broke the Lady's peace and we that will finish it. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_BRET_Dip_Reject_Peace_Chaos_01	Peace with Chaos! Ha! Never! 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_BRET_Dip_Reject_Peace_Chaos_02	We will not fall for your ruse, Chaos scum - this war will end with your deaths not until then. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_BRET_Dip_Reject_Peace_Dwarf_01	The hearts of Dwarfs and men are no longer aligned – we reject peace. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_BRET_Dip_Reject_Peace_Dwarf_02	It is too late, Dwarf, you no longer have any honour. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_BRET_Dip_Reject_Peace_Empire_01	We had high hopes for this Karl Franz von Holswig-Schliestein, but now it will end in bloodshed. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_BRET_Dip_Reject_Peace_Empire_02	You have never been good neighbours and now you must reap what you have sown. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_BRET_Dip_Reject_Peace_Greenskin_01	Peace? The Greenskins do not know the meaning of such a word! 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_BRET_Dip_Reject_Peace_Greenskin_02	There will never be peace with the Orcs and the Goblins - they have ever-been enemies of Bretonnia! 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_BRET_Dip_Reject_Peace_Vampire_01	We will purge your kind from mine Lady's lands. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_BRET_Dip_Reject_Peace_Vampire_02	No, Vampire, the war is not over until the sun shines upon Mousillon again. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_BRET_Dip_War_01	Sally forth! Bretonnia rides to war! 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_BRET_Dip_War_02	The Green Knight has been seen, it is war! 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_BRET_Dip_War_03	The Prophetess foresees war!	false
diplomacy_strings_string_BRET_Dip_War_Bretonnia_01	You bring dishonour on us all - war is the only answer! 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_BRET_Dip_War_Bretonnia_02	As you refuse to obey the king, then it is war! 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_BRET_Dip_War_Chaos_01	It is war, Northmen, prepare to be humbled! 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_BRET_Dip_War_Chaos_02	Against Chaos, there can only be war! 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_BRET_Dip_War_Dwarf_01	Never again will we rely on Dwarfen promises - war it is! 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_BRET_Dip_War_Dwarf_02	War with the Dwarfs, so be it. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_BRET_Dip_War_Empire_01	We go to war with Reikland and its puppets! 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_BRET_Dip_War_Empire_02	The Empire must be taught that it cannot treat us with such contempt - to war! 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_BRET_Dip_War_Greenskin_01	War with the Orcs! 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_BRET_Dip_War_Greenskin_02	Chivalry demands war against the Greenskin invaders! 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_BRET_Dip_War_Vampire_01	We make war with the Undead! 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_BRET_Dip_War_Vampire_02	The Undead will know fear again - when our Knights charge forth - to war! 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_BRET_Lord1_Dip_Acceptance_Negative_01	Yes, although, the Grail is something a commoner like you could never dream to sup from. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_BRET_Lord1_Dip_Acceptance_Negative_02	Agreed but do not think to dictate to me what the terms are, peasant.  	false
diplomacy_strings_string_BRET_Lord1_Dip_Acceptance_Negative_03	The Lady agrees, yet I find the whole affair odious.	false
diplomacy_strings_string_BRET_Lord1_Dip_Acceptance_Neutral_01	By the Lady's will - and only by her will - do I accept. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_BRET_Lord1_Dip_Acceptance_Neutral_02	I have spoken with the devoted of the Goddess, they advise me to accept terms. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_BRET_Lord1_Dip_Acceptance_Neutral_03	Your petition has been heard and accepted.  	false
diplomacy_strings_string_BRET_Lord1_Dip_Acceptance_Positive_01	Good, there might be aid from the dukedom forthcoming. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_BRET_Lord1_Dip_Acceptance_Positive_02	I have prayed to the Lady and believe she agrees.	false
diplomacy_strings_string_BRET_Lord1_Dip_Acceptance_Positive_03	This will be an alliance worthy of the legends!  	false
diplomacy_strings_string_BRET_Lord1_Dip_Bret_Greeting_Neg_01	I am an honourable servant of the Lady. What are your vile demands?	false
diplomacy_strings_string_BRET_Lord1_Dip_Bret_Greeting_Neg_02	What are your demands?	false
diplomacy_strings_string_BRET_Lord1_Dip_Bret_Greeting_Neg_03	Only the Grail Companions of old could hope to best me, yet you would try with words? 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_BRET_Lord1_Dip_Bret_Greeting_Neg_04	What do you want?	false
diplomacy_strings_string_BRET_Lord1_Dip_Bret_Greeting_Neu_Pos_01	The laws of chivalry demand I hear you. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_BRET_Lord1_Dip_Bret_Greeting_Neu_Pos_02	The Lady grants you safe passage in these lands… 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_BRET_Lord1_Dip_Bret_Greeting_Neu_Pos_03	Welcome friends. Let's hope we come to an accommodation. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_BRET_Lord1_Dip_Bret_Greeting_Neu_Pos_04	Welcome to fair Bretonnia. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_BRET_Lord1_Dip_Bret_Greeting_Neu_Pos_05	Welcome to fair Bretonnia. Now is the time to unite, yes?	false
diplomacy_strings_string_BRET_Lord1_Dip_Chaos_Acceptance_Negative_01	You may have once been men, but yours is a disgusting race! There is no treaty - ever! 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_BRET_Lord1_Dip_Chaos_Acceptance_Negative_02	The Chaos Gods curse us - we are forced to take their terms. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_BRET_Lord1_Dip_Chaos_Acceptance_Neutral_01	We'll accept, Northman, but this is a temporary contract, ensure your masters understand that. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_BRET_Lord1_Dip_Chaos_Acceptance_Neutral_02	Very well - the Lady weeps, but it must be done. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_BRET_Lord1_Dip_Chaos_Acceptance_Positive_01	We'll work with you this time, Northman, may the Lady forgive me! 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_BRET_Lord1_Dip_Chaos_Acceptance_Positive_02	This is the only possible course or so the Fey Enchantress claims. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_BRET_Lord1_Dip_Chaos_Greeting_Neg_01	We have nothing to say to the fetid scum of Chaos, I am an honourable servant of the Lady! 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_BRET_Lord1_Dip_Chaos_Greeting_Neg_02	Giles the Uniter once spoke to Chaos filth before he took their lives, I am reliving that moment… 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_BRET_Lord1_Dip_Chaos_Greeting_Neu_01	What are your demands, Chaos filth? 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_BRET_Lord1_Dip_Chaos_Greeting_Neu_02	It is fitting that creatures of Chaos come to fair Bretonnia to bow and scrape and plead for our aid. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_BRET_Lord1_Dip_Chaos_Greeting_Pos_01	What do the Northmen want, and why are you even still alive in my presence, Chaos-creature? 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_BRET_Lord1_Dip_Chaos_Greeting_Pos_02	It is a brave being that ravages my lands and then graces my presence and expects to live. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_BRET_Lord1_Dip_Chaos_Rejection_Negative_01	The northern tribes will be wiped from the lands, and the Lady will rejoice. I have foreseen it! 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_BRET_Lord1_Dip_Chaos_Rejection_Negative_02	No, Chaos spawn, the Green Knight will come for all your fetid kind! 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_BRET_Lord1_Dip_Chaos_Rejection_Neutral_01	No, never, the sacred places of our lands will not be despoiled by your vile kind!	false
diplomacy_strings_string_BRET_Lord1_Dip_Chaos_Rejection_Neutral_02	To even suggest it is to invite your ruin, servant of Chaos! 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_BRET_Lord1_Dip_Chaos_Rejection_Positive_01	Do you Dark Gods think us fools, Chaos man? 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_BRET_Lord1_Dip_Chaos_Rejection_Positive_02	Take your offer back to your foul masters and tell them that Bretonnia shall never fall! 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_BRET_Lord1_Dip_Dwarf_Acceptance_Negative_01	Yes, Bretonnia will bail out the Dwarfs, yet again - best remove us from your grudge tome? 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_BRET_Lord1_Dip_Dwarf_Acceptance_Negative_02	The Lady speaks through the Damsels, and they say we should agree, but I know you too well, Dwarfs! 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_BRET_Lord1_Dip_Dwarf_Acceptance_Neutral_01	I suppose, but Bretonnia will not be taken advantage of as you and the Empire are want to do. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_BRET_Lord1_Dip_Dwarf_Acceptance_Neutral_02	My king agrees, but I'm less swayed, Dwarf - too many times have I been bruised by your spiteful tongues.  	false
diplomacy_strings_string_BRET_Lord1_Dip_Dwarf_Acceptance_Positive_01	So it shall be, Dwarf.	false
diplomacy_strings_string_BRET_Lord1_Dip_Dwarf_Acceptance_Positive_02	Agreed - an alliance of old shall be reborn!	false
diplomacy_strings_string_BRET_Lord1_Dip_Dwarf_Greeting_Neg_01	Dwarf, you come helmet in hand - you must be in trouble, looking to fare Bretonnia to bail you out! 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_BRET_Lord1_Dip_Dwarf_Greeting_Neg_02	I might have known, the days are doom-laden and so the Dwarfs come begging for help! 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_BRET_Lord1_Dip_Dwarf_Greeting_Neu_01	Mountain-folk come to treat - I hope you have something worthy to offer? 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_BRET_Lord1_Dip_Dwarf_Greeting_Neu_02	Dwarfs! How may the Lady and her valiant Knights help you? 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_BRET_Lord1_Dip_Dwarf_Greeting_Pos_01	How do the Dwarf realms fare in these dark days? 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_BRET_Lord1_Dip_Dwarf_Greeting_Pos_02	Mountain-folk, the Lady has always respected your ancestors, let's hope we come to an accommodation. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_BRET_Lord1_Dip_Dwarf_Rejection_Negative_01	No, let the Karaz Ankor fail - it matters not to Bretonnia.	false
diplomacy_strings_string_BRET_Lord1_Dip_Dwarf_Rejection_Negative_02	Your on your own, Dwarfs, you'd best get used to eating rock and gold!	false
diplomacy_strings_string_BRET_Lord1_Dip_Dwarf_Rejection_Neutral_01	Not this time, Dwarf, go about your business and Bretonnia will go about hers.	false
diplomacy_strings_string_BRET_Lord1_Dip_Dwarf_Rejection_Neutral_02	No, Dwarf - you are on your own this time.	false
diplomacy_strings_string_BRET_Lord1_Dip_Dwarf_Rejection_Positive_01	I'm afraid not, Dwarf, it is ill-timed.	false
diplomacy_strings_string_BRET_Lord1_Dip_Dwarf_Rejection_Positive_02	Sorry, tell your High King, our resources are simply stretched too thin.	false
diplomacy_strings_string_BRET_Lord1_Dip_Empire_Acceptance_Negative_01	I am ordered to agree, but your greedy burgomeisters will not profit from Bretonnia. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_BRET_Lord1_Dip_Empire_Acceptance_Negative_02	The Damsels have screaming visions of the Empire's doom - we must agree the treaty for the sake of our realm. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_BRET_Lord1_Dip_Empire_Acceptance_Neutral_01	Yes, this suits our needs as much as yours, Reiklander. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_BRET_Lord1_Dip_Empire_Acceptance_Neutral_02	King Leoncoeur would agree so I must as well.	false
diplomacy_strings_string_BRET_Lord1_Dip_Empire_Acceptance_Positive_01	Agreed - my king will be pleased that the Sons of Sigmar ascent. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_BRET_Lord1_Dip_Empire_Acceptance_Positive_02	Good, kingdom and empire will combine for the fate of man. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_BRET_Lord1_Dip_Empire_Greeting_Neg_01	What do Sigmar's sorry gets, need from the valiant Knights of Bretonnia this time? 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_BRET_Lord1_Dip_Empire_Greeting_Neg_02	The Empire - a land of peasants and low-born pocket-changers. I have no respect for such people. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_BRET_Lord1_Dip_Empire_Greeting_Neu_01	Hail, Sigmar's Sons, do you come looking for aid or to cause trouble? I never know with Reiklanders.  	false
diplomacy_strings_string_BRET_Lord1_Dip_Empire_Greeting_Neu_02	What does the Emperor need that he cannot already find in his vast, if tainted, lands. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_BRET_Lord1_Dip_Empire_Greeting_Pos_01	Welcome, friends - what do the Men of the Hammer require this day?	false
diplomacy_strings_string_BRET_Lord1_Dip_Empire_Greeting_Pos_02	Hail, fellow nation of men, now is the time to unite, yes? 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_BRET_Lord1_Dip_Empire_Rejection_Negative_01	No, you and your greedy, blood-soaked Guilds are on your own, Reiklander! 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_BRET_Lord1_Dip_Empire_Rejection_Negative_02	Tell your Emperor to keep his truces and his Runefangs - no help from my realm will come!  	false
diplomacy_strings_string_BRET_Lord1_Dip_Empire_Rejection_Neutral_01	No, you may be men, but are selfish, greedy… untrustworthy. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_BRET_Lord1_Dip_Empire_Rejection_Neutral_02	You have Knights in the Empire, but it is no coincidence that they have never been gifted with a Grail vision. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_BRET_Lord1_Dip_Empire_Rejection_Positive_01	No, maybe in the dark days to come but for now, Bretonnia forges its own path. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_BRET_Lord1_Dip_Empire_Rejection_Positive_02	The Lady cannot help Sigmar this day. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_BRET_Lord1_Dip_Greenskin_Acceptance_Negative_01	This is a travesty of fate! Yet I must concede. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_BRET_Lord1_Dip_Greenskin_Acceptance_Negative_02	Lady forgive us, but the Greenskins need to be appeased! 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_BRET_Lord1_Dip_Greenskin_Acceptance_Neutral_01	For the gods and the Lady above all - I am compelled to agree. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_BRET_Lord1_Dip_Greenskin_Acceptance_Neutral_02	By the Grail, we are forced to work with the Greenskins! 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_BRET_Lord1_Dip_Greenskin_Acceptance_Positive_01	Yes, why not? Morrslieb hangs low and the world gets stranger every day!	false
diplomacy_strings_string_BRET_Lord1_Dip_Greenskin_Acceptance_Positive_02	I have checked the histories - it has happened once before. We will work with you this time, Orc. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_BRET_Lord1_Dip_Greenskin_Greeting_Neg_01	Orc scum, you dare! What are your vile demands?! 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_BRET_Lord1_Dip_Greenskin_Greeting_Neg_02	Abase your filthy body, Orc! Only then will I hear your message. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_BRET_Lord1_Dip_Greenskin_Greeting_Neu_01	What do you even know of chivalry, Orc? 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_BRET_Lord1_Dip_Greenskin_Greeting_Neu_02	Greenskin, you come as supplicant, I will hear you out of curiosity rather than need!	false
diplomacy_strings_string_BRET_Lord1_Dip_Greenskin_Greeting_Pos_01	I will hear you, Orc, for it amuses me. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_BRET_Lord1_Dip_Greenskin_Greeting_Pos_02	Greenskin, you petition a duke of Bretonnia. I only hope you speak sense.  	false
diplomacy_strings_string_BRET_Lord1_Dip_Greenskin_Rejection_Negative_01	Now is the time of Louen Orc-Slayer once again! Your deaths will be swift, Greenskins! 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_BRET_Lord1_Dip_Greenskin_Rejection_Negative_02	No, never - you are the Lady's enemies - green despoilers that will be slain on sight! 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_BRET_Lord1_Dip_Greenskin_Rejection_Neutral_01	I'll have you chased from here, Orc, with a full stable of Knights Errant!	false
diplomacy_strings_string_BRET_Lord1_Dip_Greenskin_Rejection_Neutral_02	Greenskins, your time has come. There will be no help or aid from Bretonnia - we are your mortal foes!	false
diplomacy_strings_string_BRET_Lord1_Dip_Greenskin_Rejection_Positive_01	Get out of my sight, Orc - while your notion still amuses me. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_BRET_Lord1_Dip_Greenskin_Rejection_Positive_02	No, Orc - Bretonnia is pure, your race is not. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_BRET_Lord1_Dip_Greeting_Neg_01	Whether chivalrous or not, I will strike you down, scum, if your words displease me! 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_BRET_Lord1_Dip_Greeting_Neg_02	Only the Grail Companions of old could hope to best me, yet you would try with words? 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_BRET_Lord1_Dip_Greeting_Neg_03	What vile filth stands before me? 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_BRET_Lord1_Dip_Greeting_Neu_01	Bow before the rightful Lords of these lands and I will hear your demands.	false
diplomacy_strings_string_BRET_Lord1_Dip_Greeting_Neu_02	These lands are ours by the right granted from the Lady of the Lake! What do you want? 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_BRET_Lord1_Dip_Greeting_Neu_03	The laws of chivalry demand I hear you. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_BRET_Lord1_Dip_Greeting_Pos_01	Welcome to fair Bretonnia, commoner. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_BRET_Lord1_Dip_Greeting_Pos_02	Bow before the rightful Lords of these lands and I will hear your demands.	false
diplomacy_strings_string_BRET_Lord1_Dip_Greeting_Pos_03	The Lady grants you safe passage in these lands.	false
diplomacy_strings_string_BRET_Lord1_Dip_Rejection_Negative_01	No, the Green Knight will be coming for a wretch like you. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_BRET_Lord1_Dip_Rejection_Negative_02	No, impure one, there will be no aid from Bretonnia for you. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_BRET_Lord1_Dip_Rejection_Negative_03	Never - there is nothing I despise more than the begging and pleading of the unworthy. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_BRET_Lord1_Dip_Rejection_Neutral_01	Not this day, or the next - Bretonnia's lands and riches are forbidden to you. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_BRET_Lord1_Dip_Rejection_Neutral_02	Only those who have faith in the Grail can take from these lands, that does not include you. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_BRET_Lord1_Dip_Rejection_Neutral_03	I will vanquish your armies, should you come crawling back to these lands! 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_BRET_Lord1_Dip_Rejection_Positive_01	No, Bretonnia weeps, but we cannot help you. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_BRET_Lord1_Dip_Rejection_Positive_02	I prayed to the Lady for guidance, yet no answer came. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_BRET_Lord1_Dip_Rejection_Positive_03	Another season maybe, but, for now, the peasants must get the harvest in. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_BRET_Lord1_Dip_Vampire_Acceptance_Negative_01	This is unfortunate, but for the sake of the sacred stones and lakes, I agree the terms. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_BRET_Lord1_Dip_Vampire_Acceptance_Negative_02	I have conferred with King Leoncoeur and, against my judgement, he accepts the ghoul-keeper's offer.  	false
diplomacy_strings_string_BRET_Lord1_Dip_Vampire_Acceptance_Neutral_01	I am forced to agree, liche, but this is not the end of it. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_BRET_Lord1_Dip_Vampire_Acceptance_Neutral_02	Yes - don't take this treaty as an ascent that your foul race should exist in these fair lands! 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_BRET_Lord1_Dip_Vampire_Acceptance_Positive_01	Against my own preferences, we have agreement. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_BRET_Lord1_Dip_Vampire_Acceptance_Positive_02	Very well - but keep your fetid ghoul-creatures away from the menhirs. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_BRET_Lord1_Dip_Vampire_Greeting_Neg_01	Tomb-scum, what do you have to say to me that would not affront mine Lady's ears?	false
diplomacy_strings_string_BRET_Lord1_Dip_Vampire_Greeting_Neg_02	You think evading Morr is impressive? By the Lady's Will, I will send you back to Him myself! 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_BRET_Lord1_Dip_Vampire_Greeting_Neu_01	Undead creature - are you bold, foolish or just arrogant to approach a servant of the Lady this way? 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_BRET_Lord1_Dip_Vampire_Greeting_Neu_02	Your offer best be good, Vampire, for I am itching to stake you here and now! 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_BRET_Lord1_Dip_Vampire_Greeting_Pos_01	Speak, Vampire, so that I may readily reject your petition! 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_BRET_Lord1_Dip_Vampire_Greeting_Pos_02	You must be desperate indeed, liche, to seek the aid of the chivalrous Bretonnian might! 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_BRET_Lord1_Dip_Vampire_Rejection_Negative_01	Get into the daylight, Vampire - I'll see the sun burn your skin off before I agree to any pact! 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_BRET_Lord1_Dip_Vampire_Rejection_Negative_02	For the Grail and the Lady, I reject your offer and your very existence! 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_BRET_Lord1_Dip_Vampire_Rejection_Neutral_01	I reject this with joy in my heart, no treaty with Undead filth! 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_BRET_Lord1_Dip_Vampire_Rejection_Neutral_02	No, back to the cemeteries with you! 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_BRET_Lord1_Dip_Vampire_Rejection_Positive_01	You are bold, creature I will give you that, but there is nothing else I would ever offer. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_BRET_Lord1_Dip_Vampire_Rejection_Positive_02	No, I cannot let your hordes blight our lands! 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_BRET_Lord2_Dip_Bret_Greeting_Neg_01	I am an honourable servant of the lady. What are your vile demands?	false
diplomacy_strings_string_BRET_Lord2_Dip_Bret_Greeting_Neg_02	What are your demands?	false

diplomacy_strings_string_BRET_Lord2_Dip_Bret_Greeting_Neg_04	What do you want?	false
diplomacy_strings_string_BRET_Lord2_Dip_Bret_Greeting_Neu_Pos_01	The laws of chivalry demand I hear you. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_BRET_Lord2_Dip_Bret_Greeting_Neu_Pos_02	The Lady grants you safe passage in these lands… 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_BRET_Lord2_Dip_Bret_Greeting_Neu_Pos_03	Welcome friends.  Let's hope we come to an accommodation. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_BRET_Lord2_Dip_Bret_Greeting_Neu_Pos_04	Welcome to fair Bretonnia. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_BRET_Lord2_Dip_Bret_Greeting_Neu_Pos_05	Welcome to fair Bretonnia. Now is the time to unite, yes?	false
diplomacy_strings_string_BRET_Lord2_Dip_Chaos_Greeting_Neg_01	We have nothing to say to the fetid scum of Chaos, I am an honourable servant of the Lady! 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_BRET_Lord2_Dip_Chaos_Greeting_Neg_02	Gilles the Uniter once spoke to Chaos filth before he took their lives. I am reliving that moment… 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_BRET_Lord2_Dip_Chaos_Greeting_Neu_01	What are your demands, Chaos filth? 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_BRET_Lord2_Dip_Chaos_Greeting_Neu_02	It is fitting that creatures of Chaos come to fair Bretonnia to bow and scrape and plead for our aid. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_BRET_Lord2_Dip_Chaos_Greeting_Pos_01	What do the Northmen want, and why are you even still alive in my presence, Chaos-creature? 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_BRET_Lord2_Dip_Chaos_Greeting_Pos_02	It is a brave being that ravages my lands and then graces my presence and expects to live. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_BRET_Lord2_Dip_Dwarf_Greeting_Neg_01	Dwarf, you come helmet in hand - you must be in trouble, looking to fair Bretonnia to bail you out! 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_BRET_Lord2_Dip_Dwarf_Greeting_Neg_02	I might have known, the days are doom-laden and so the Dwarfs come begging for help! 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_BRET_Lord2_Dip_Dwarf_Greeting_Neu_01	Mountain-folk come to treat - I hope you have something worthy to offer? 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_BRET_Lord2_Dip_Dwarf_Greeting_Neu_02	Dwarfs! How may the Lady and her valiant Knights help you? 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_BRET_Lord2_Dip_Dwarf_Greeting_Pos_01	How do the Dwarf realms fare in these dark days? 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_BRET_Lord2_Dip_Dwarf_Greeting_Pos_02	Mountain-folk, the Lady has always respected your ancestors. Let's hope we come to an accommodation. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_BRET_Lord2_Dip_Empire_Greeting_Neg_01	What do Sigmar's sorry gets need from the valiant Knights of Bretonnia this time? 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_BRET_Lord2_Dip_Empire_Greeting_Neg_02	The Empire - a land of peasants and low-born pocket-changers. I have no respect for such people. 	false

diplomacy_strings_string_BRET_Lord2_Dip_Empire_Greeting_Pos_02	Hail, fellow nation of men. Now is the time to unite, yes? 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_BRET_Lord2_Dip_Greenskin_Greeting_Neg_01	Orc scum, you dare! What are your vile demands?! 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_BRET_Lord2_Dip_Greenskin_Greeting_Neg_02	Abase your filthy body Orc! Only then will I hear your message. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_BRET_Lord2_Dip_Greenskin_Greeting_Neu_01	What do you even know of chivalry, Orc? 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_BRET_Lord2_Dip_Greenskin_Greeting_Neu_02	Greenskin, you come as supplicant, I will hear you out of curiosity rather than need!	false
diplomacy_strings_string_BRET_Lord2_Dip_Greenskin_Greeting_Pos_01	I will hear you, Orc, for it amuses me. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_BRET_Lord2_Dip_Greenskin_Greeting_Pos_02	Greenskin, you petition a duke of Bretonnia. I only hope you speak sense.  	false

diplomacy_strings_string_BRET_Lord2_Dip_Greeting_Neg_03	What vile filth stands before me? 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_BRET_Lord2_Dip_Greeting_Neu_01	Bow before the rightful lords of these lands and I will hear your demands.	false
diplomacy_strings_string_BRET_Lord2_Dip_Greeting_Neu_02	These lands are ours by the right granted by the Lady of the Lake! What do you want? 	false

diplomacy_strings_string_BRET_Lord2_Dip_Vampire_Greeting_Pos_02	You must be desperate indeed, liche, to seek the aid of the chivalrous Bretonnian might! 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_BRET_Louen_Dip_Acceptance_Negative_01	I want to vanquish you, but the Enchantress counsels me to accept.	false
diplomacy_strings_string_BRET_Louen_Dip_Acceptance_Negative_02	Don't make me regret this decision, the consequences for you will be great. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_BRET_Louen_Dip_Acceptance_Negative_03	The Council of Nobles rejects this offer… and so I accept, don't make me a fool for this!	false
diplomacy_strings_string_BRET_Louen_Dip_Acceptance_Neutral_01	Very well, the treaty is signed. By the Grail, I hope I make a wise recourse. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_BRET_Louen_Dip_Acceptance_Neutral_02	The Fay Enchantress whispers to me - this is an agreement I must make. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_BRET_Louen_Dip_Acceptance_Neutral_03	Yes, but do not let this pageantry blind you… Or mistake me for a fool… 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_BRET_Louen_Dip_Acceptance_Positive_01	We have an accord, let's mark this day with a great tournament! 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_BRET_Louen_Dip_Acceptance_Positive_02	Yes, the nobles will be pleased – it's always good to halt their plotting for a time. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_BRET_Louen_Dip_Acceptance_Positive_03	An agreement then! Bring out the wine - the 1532 Bordeleaux will do for this occasion. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_BRET_Louen_Dip_Chaos_Acceptance_Negative_01	I must - may the kingdom forgive me! 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_BRET_Louen_Dip_Chaos_Acceptance_Negative_02	It galls me - I am compelled to follow a prophecy given by the Enchantress. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_BRET_Louen_Dip_Chaos_Acceptance_Neutral_01	If I must, but I will see you on my lance for this, scum!  	false
diplomacy_strings_string_BRET_Louen_Dip_Chaos_Acceptance_Neutral_02	Yes - Lady guide me, for I make a terrible decision.	false
diplomacy_strings_string_BRET_Louen_Dip_Chaos_Acceptance_Positive_01	I am not happy about this, but I must consent.	false
diplomacy_strings_string_BRET_Louen_Dip_Chaos_Acceptance_Positive_02	So it must be.	false
diplomacy_strings_string_BRET_Louen_Dip_Chaos_Greeting_Neg_01	Chaos filth! Get back on your longship, before I order it sank by trebuchet!	false
diplomacy_strings_string_BRET_Louen_Dip_Chaos_Greeting_Neg_02	I'll bring about the end of your tribes, Northmen - Bretonnia will take it all in the Lady's name.	false
diplomacy_strings_string_BRET_Louen_Dip_Chaos_Greeting_Neu_01	You dare come before me, Northman? What do your fell masters want of Bretonnia?	false
diplomacy_strings_string_BRET_Louen_Dip_Chaos_Greeting_Neu_02	There is still pride in Bretonnia enough to listen and reject the lies of Chaos maggots!	false
diplomacy_strings_string_BRET_Louen_Dip_Chaos_Greeting_Pos_01	I'll hear you out, Chaos worm, but do not expect blessings from the King of Bretonnia!	false
diplomacy_strings_string_BRET_Louen_Dip_Chaos_Greeting_Pos_02	What could the Northmen want that they deem it necessary to parley? 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_BRET_Louen_Dip_Chaos_Rejection_Negative_01	Never! I would renounce my throne and let my bastard sit on it before siding with you!	false
diplomacy_strings_string_BRET_Louen_Dip_Chaos_Rejection_Negative_02	The Ruinous Powers take too many liberties with my kingdom - they will pay! 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_BRET_Louen_Dip_Chaos_Rejection_Neutral_01	A vile notion - one I would dearly like to punish with your death, Chaos filth. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_BRET_Louen_Dip_Chaos_Rejection_Neutral_02	I reject your 'offer' and your vile Gods! 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_BRET_Louen_Dip_Chaos_Rejection_Positive_01	I have ruled for two decades - do you think me greener than the Green Knight? Be gone! 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_BRET_Louen_Dip_Chaos_Rejection_Positive_02	I'll let you leave alive, agent of Chaos, but my Knights hanker to run you through - consider this a head start. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_BRET_Louen_Dip_Dwarf_Acceptance_Negative_01	Fine - Bretonnia accepts the Dwarf plan for the good of my nation, not the Karaz Ankor. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_BRET_Louen_Dip_Dwarf_Acceptance_Negative_02	I suppose so, Dwarf, but I do this of necessity, not goodwill. Your kind has burnt all goodwill from me. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_BRET_Louen_Dip_Dwarf_Acceptance_Neutral_01	Good, an agreement is reached. Do not let me down again, Dwarf.	false
diplomacy_strings_string_BRET_Louen_Dip_Dwarf_Acceptance_Neutral_02	We have worked together before. Just temper your spite, grudge-holder, and this treaty can last. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_BRET_Louen_Dip_Dwarf_Acceptance_Positive_01	We have a treaty, Dwarf - forgive me if I celebrate with a robust red instead of that grog you enjoy so much. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_BRET_Louen_Dip_Dwarf_Acceptance_Positive_02	Yes, two honourable races join in alliance. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_BRET_Louen_Dip_Dwarf_Greeting_Neg_01	You vex me greatly, Dwarf. Maybe I should just slay you instead? 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_BRET_Louen_Dip_Dwarf_Greeting_Neg_02	Here come the Dwarfs to lecture, criticise, and demand - what do you want? 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_BRET_Louen_Dip_Dwarf_Greeting_Neu_01	You come as a supplicant, Dwarf? Not too proud to ask for favours now? 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_BRET_Louen_Dip_Dwarf_Greeting_Neu_02	How can the King of Bretonnia aid the Dwarfholds? What boon do you ask of me? 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_BRET_Louen_Dip_Dwarf_Greeting_Pos_01	The Dwarfs have ever-been friends of Bretonnia - what brings you down from your mountain, Dawi? 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_BRET_Louen_Dip_Dwarf_Greeting_Pos_02	Welcome, Dwarf, do you bring news from the mountain realms?	false
diplomacy_strings_string_BRET_Louen_Dip_Dwarf_Rejection_Negative_01	No, Grudge-kin, my patience for your race has worn thin. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_BRET_Louen_Dip_Dwarf_Rejection_Negative_02	No, Thorgrim does not deign to come himself and treat with me king to king. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_BRET_Louen_Dip_Dwarf_Rejection_Neutral_01	I have no time for the petty offences of the Dwarfs - too much is at stake. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_BRET_Louen_Dip_Dwarf_Rejection_Neutral_02	Stay your hand, Dwarf, there is no agreement - tell Thorgrim so. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_BRET_Louen_Dip_Dwarf_Rejection_Positive_01	Bad news for your High King. Bretonnia cannot aid you on this occasion. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_BRET_Louen_Dip_Dwarf_Rejection_Positive_02	Not this time, Dwarf, try again next feast day. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_BRET_Louen_Dip_Empire_Acceptance_Negative_01	Agreed, but my terms are strict in these doomed times. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_BRET_Louen_Dip_Empire_Acceptance_Negative_02	Reiklander, I do not care for this Emperor - too arrogant by far - Yet I'm forced into ascent. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_BRET_Louen_Dip_Empire_Acceptance_Neutral_01	Yes, we have a treaty. The terms are set, do not think to change them, Reiklander. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_BRET_Louen_Dip_Empire_Acceptance_Neutral_02	Despite your insolence, Reiklander, I will agree to this.	false
diplomacy_strings_string_BRET_Louen_Dip_Empire_Acceptance_Positive_01	An alliance of men - the strongest pact this world has ever seen! 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_BRET_Louen_Dip_Empire_Acceptance_Positive_02	Yes, together the creatures of Chaos do not stand a chance.	false
diplomacy_strings_string_BRET_Louen_Dip_Empire_Greeting_Neg_01	As expected, Franz, only comes calling when he needs something, but it is far too late!	false
diplomacy_strings_string_BRET_Louen_Dip_Empire_Greeting_Neg_02	My Lady speaks unfavourably of Sigmar. You worship a false god, so why should I listen? 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_BRET_Louen_Dip_Empire_Greeting_Neu_01	It's late in the day for the Empire to send its ambassadors to my door!	false
diplomacy_strings_string_BRET_Louen_Dip_Empire_Greeting_Neu_02	The Empire only cross the Grey Mountains when they need something from me. What is it this time? 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_BRET_Louen_Dip_Empire_Greeting_Pos_01	Our neighbours in the east deign to visit - I hope you bring glad tidings. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_BRET_Louen_Dip_Empire_Greeting_Pos_02	Welcome, how fares the Emperor in these dark times? 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_BRET_Louen_Dip_Empire_Rejection_Negative_01	No - the Empire is too fractured. Your nation is doomed, yet my kingdom can survive. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_BRET_Louen_Dip_Empire_Rejection_Negative_02	There is no treaty, Reiklander - I forbid it! 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_BRET_Louen_Dip_Empire_Rejection_Neutral_01	No, this time the Empire must fare on its own. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_BRET_Louen_Dip_Empire_Rejection_Neutral_02	Too many times Bretonnian has sought alliance with the Empire and been rebuffed. Now it is their turn… 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_BRET_Louen_Dip_Empire_Rejection_Positive_01	I would like nothing better than to join our two nations, but the time is not right. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_BRET_Louen_Dip_Empire_Rejection_Positive_02	No, tell Franz he approaches me at an inopportune time. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_BRET_Louen_Dip_Greenskin_Acceptance_Negative_01	If we must work with Orcs, I will - although it shames Gilles the Uniter's legacy.	false
diplomacy_strings_string_BRET_Louen_Dip_Greenskin_Acceptance_Negative_02	Hide the eyes of the Damsels, for I must agree this treaty with fell Orcs. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_BRET_Louen_Dip_Greenskin_Acceptance_Neutral_01	Very well, it serves Bretonnia, but I'll be keeping a close eye on you, Greenskin. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_BRET_Louen_Dip_Greenskin_Acceptance_Neutral_02	Yes, I do this for the Grail - not for your disgusting kind. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_BRET_Louen_Dip_Greenskin_Acceptance_Positive_01	Very well, the Lady informs me this suits Bretonnian interests for now. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_BRET_Louen_Dip_Greenskin_Acceptance_Positive_02	Fine, do your thing, Orc, as long as it is not in Bretonnian lands.  	false
diplomacy_strings_string_BRET_Louen_Dip_Greenskin_Greeting_Neg_01	Orc, you defile my sacred groves and yet come to parley - don't expect to keep your green head!  	false
diplomacy_strings_string_BRET_Louen_Dip_Greenskin_Greeting_Neg_02	I will not treat with Orc scum - theirs is a vile race that needs scouring from my lands! 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_BRET_Louen_Dip_Greenskin_Greeting_Neu_01	Beast! My ancestor was Louen Orc-Slayer, should I invoke his name? 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_BRET_Louen_Dip_Greenskin_Greeting_Neu_02	Tell me why I do not issue an Errantry War against your entire race right now, Orc? 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_BRET_Louen_Dip_Greenskin_Greeting_Pos_01	Orcs! That is all I need! What do you want, Greenskin? 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_BRET_Louen_Dip_Greenskin_Greeting_Pos_02	Can you even talk with that guttural mouth, Orc? 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_BRET_Louen_Dip_Greenskin_Rejection_Negative_01	No - I do not talk to Greenskins, we behead them! 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_BRET_Louen_Dip_Greenskin_Rejection_Negative_02	Be gone, green filth - never darken this realm again! 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_BRET_Louen_Dip_Greenskin_Rejection_Neutral_01	No, Orc, I'll see your tribe massacred rather than broker a deal with you!	false
diplomacy_strings_string_BRET_Louen_Dip_Greenskin_Rejection_Neutral_02	I think not, Greenskin - I'll have Beaquis feed on your innards rather than work with you. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_BRET_Louen_Dip_Greenskin_Rejection_Positive_01	The Lady forbids that we ally with Orcs! 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_BRET_Louen_Dip_Greenskin_Rejection_Positive_02	Ha! The whole concept is beyond understanding, back to your fouls dwellings, Orcs! 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_BRET_Louen_Dip_Greeting_Neg_01	Not one step further, stranger - you do not walk my lands without my blessing - which you don't have!  	false
diplomacy_strings_string_BRET_Louen_Dip_Greeting_Neg_02	This is Bretonnia; I am its king! For the Lady's sake, state your demands, so I can reject them! 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_BRET_Louen_Dip_Greeting_Neg_03	You are a guest in my realm. You will act like it, or I will strike you down where you stand! 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_BRET_Louen_Dip_Greeting_Neu_01	You come to Bretonnia, stranger. I am its king - let us hope you leave as a friend… 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_BRET_Louen_Dip_Greeting_Neu_02	You tread upon Bretonnian land. I'll have your will, and I'll have it now!	false
diplomacy_strings_string_BRET_Louen_Dip_Greeting_Neu_03	I am King Leoncoeur. So, do you come to Bretonnia as its friend or enemy?  	false
diplomacy_strings_string_BRET_Louen_Dip_Greeting_Pos_01	Let the supplicant come forward. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_BRET_Louen_Dip_Greeting_Pos_02	Do you wish the Lady's favour? 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_BRET_Louen_Dip_Greeting_Pos_03	You ask for a boon, speak and I will see if it is within my power to give.	false
diplomacy_strings_string_BRET_Louen_Dip_Rejection_Negative_01	Do not think to command me! I am the king of this realm! Now go, before my Knights set about you. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_BRET_Louen_Dip_Rejection_Negative_02	Yours is a race I despise. There is no agreement and never will be! 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_BRET_Louen_Dip_Rejection_Negative_03	Get from my sign, cur, before I summon the Grail Knights to bring me your head!	false
diplomacy_strings_string_BRET_Louen_Dip_Rejection_Neutral_01	No, Bretonnia is best served by banishing you from the realm. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_BRET_Louen_Dip_Rejection_Neutral_02	I reject this notion - as is my right, granted to me by the Lady herself!	false
diplomacy_strings_string_BRET_Louen_Dip_Rejection_Neutral_03	What you ask for is something that should be dressed in motley and called a fool's wish!	false
diplomacy_strings_string_BRET_Louen_Dip_Rejection_Positive_01	No, I fear this will end in tears. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_BRET_Louen_Dip_Rejection_Positive_02	I'm afraid not - the dukes would be in uproar! 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_BRET_Louen_Dip_Rejection_Positive_03	We must adjourn this meeting. Another time perhaps? 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_BRET_Louen_Dip_Vampire_Acceptance_Negative_01	So it must be. A fell choice.	false
diplomacy_strings_string_BRET_Louen_Dip_Vampire_Acceptance_Negative_02	Yes, but I despise your kind, and will crusade until you are all are back in Morr's realm. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_BRET_Louen_Dip_Vampire_Acceptance_Neutral_01	I am forced into this by circumstances, liche - know that I will break it as soon as I can. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_BRET_Louen_Dip_Vampire_Acceptance_Neutral_02	Yes - it galls me greatly, but… yes. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_BRET_Louen_Dip_Vampire_Acceptance_Positive_01	A necessary pact. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_BRET_Louen_Dip_Vampire_Acceptance_Positive_02	We have agreement, but I take no joy in it. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_BRET_Louen_Dip_Vampire_Greeting_Neg_01	Spawn of Mousillon, Beaquis will feast on your entrails for even daring to be in my presence!	false
diplomacy_strings_string_BRET_Louen_Dip_Vampire_Greeting_Neg_02	I feel the Lady's anger at your presence, Vampire - say what you will, but be quick! 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_BRET_Louen_Dip_Vampire_Greeting_Neu_01	Your mocking bow does not frighten me, Corpse-spawn - I'll have that head as I have many of your kind. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_BRET_Louen_Dip_Vampire_Greeting_Neu_02	What is your message, tomb-scum? Speak it now so my Lady can reject its unholy words. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_BRET_Louen_Dip_Vampire_Greeting_Pos_01	Dread Knight of Mousillon - what do you want? 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_BRET_Louen_Dip_Vampire_Greeting_Pos_02	I will hear you out, Vampire-spawn, but make no promises as to the conduct of my Knights… 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_BRET_Louen_Dip_Vampire_Rejection_Negative_01	By the Grail, no! I am king of this fair realm, not some disgusting liche! 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_BRET_Louen_Dip_Vampire_Rejection_Negative_02	Never - Kemmler, the von Carsteins - none are welcome here!	false
diplomacy_strings_string_BRET_Louen_Dip_Vampire_Rejection_Neutral_01	Be gone from my lands, Undead filth. The Knights Errant will be on your trail soon enough!	false
diplomacy_strings_string_BRET_Louen_Dip_Vampire_Rejection_Neutral_02	Tell Kemmler and all his ilk, I will hunt you down and raise Mousillon to the ground!	false
diplomacy_strings_string_BRET_Louen_Dip_Vampire_Rejection_Positive_01	The Lady would never forgive me! No!	false
diplomacy_strings_string_BRET_Louen_Dip_Vampire_Rejection_Positive_02	Get from my sight, foul creature.	false
diplomacy_strings_string_CHAOS_Arc_Dip_Acceptance_Negative_01	Gah! It gals me, but yes!	false
diplomacy_strings_string_CHAOS_Arc_Dip_Acceptance_Negative_02	I have the rage of Khorne for this, but my masters order me to agree!	false
diplomacy_strings_string_CHAOS_Arc_Dip_Acceptance_Negative_03	So be it, mortal scum, but your flayed skin will adorn my cloak for this outrage!	false
diplomacy_strings_string_CHAOS_Arc_Dip_Acceptance_Neutral_01	Such a pact is possible, but I sense betrayal on your mind. That will be your last mistake.	false
diplomacy_strings_string_CHAOS_Arc_Dip_Acceptance_Neutral_02	I have consulted with hellish oracles on this and they agree to the pact.	false
diplomacy_strings_string_CHAOS_Arc_Dip_Acceptance_Neutral_03	My loyal Swords of Chaos counsel against this, but I feel I should accept.	false
diplomacy_strings_string_CHAOS_Arc_Dip_Acceptance_Positive_01	Very well, we have a pact. However, your very existence is forfeit should you betray my will. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_CHAOS_Arc_Dip_Acceptance_Positive_02	It seems we have an agreement, witnessed by the Chaos Gods. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_CHAOS_Arc_Dip_Acceptance_Positive_03	And now we will complete the concord with a sacrifice… 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_CHAOS_Arc_Dip_Bretonnia_Acceptance_Negative_01	This must be another trial by my Dark Gods, for I am forced into a pact with backwater yokels. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_CHAOS_Arc_Dip_Bretonnia_Acceptance_Negative_02	Gaarh! Tzeentch spites me! Yes, we have a truce of sorts, Bretonnian scum! 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_CHAOS_Arc_Dip_Bretonnia_Acceptance_Neutral_01	Yes, we may have a compact, providing the low-born sacrifices are delivered as promised!	false
diplomacy_strings_string_CHAOS_Arc_Dip_Bretonnia_Acceptance_Neutral_02	Agreed, but should that mer-witch you "worship" show up - I'll ravage it. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_CHAOS_Arc_Dip_Bretonnia_Acceptance_Positive_01	Ha, why not?! I accept!	false
diplomacy_strings_string_CHAOS_Arc_Dip_Bretonnia_Acceptance_Positive_02	The arrogance of Bretonnian Knights - I can use this. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_CHAOS_Arc_Dip_Bretonnia_Rejection_Negative_01	There is not one thing - not one trinket - you can offer, that will prevent me from obliterating Bretonnia and wiping it from the map!	false
diplomacy_strings_string_CHAOS_Arc_Dip_Bretonnia_Rejection_Negative_02	Bretonnia's fate is sealed. I will murder everyone within its borders, salt the fields and taint its lakes! 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_CHAOS_Arc_Dip_Bretonnia_Rejection_Neutral_01	An idiotic notion! Bretonnia is a backwater, it holds little for me except for blood and slaughter. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_CHAOS_Arc_Dip_Bretonnia_Rejection_Neutral_02	No - your Knights are nothing; your peasants' souls are weak and brittle. I'll take them all from you anyway! 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_CHAOS_Arc_Dip_Bretonnia_Rejection_Positive_01	Hahaha, you wish for some pact? My rivals would mock and fell me from my noble station!	false
diplomacy_strings_string_CHAOS_Arc_Dip_Bretonnia_Rejection_Positive_02	I have the favour of all four Great Powers, why would I jeopardise that by working with… Bretonnians! 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_CHAOS_Arc_Dip_Chaos_Acceptance_Negative_01	Yes-yes, we will ally, but your utter abasement is more than necessary, it is assured. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_CHAOS_Arc_Dip_Chaos_Acceptance_Negative_02	Very well - but do not attempt usurp me! I have a special hell for traitors to the Everchosen. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_CHAOS_Arc_Dip_Chaos_Acceptance_Neutral_01	Good, an alliance will benefit this invasion and see gifts from the masters rain down upon us both. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_CHAOS_Arc_Dip_Chaos_Acceptance_Neutral_02	I expect total obedience, but in reward for your support, apotheosis awaits. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_CHAOS_Arc_Dip_Chaos_Acceptance_Positive_01	Good - our armies shall march as one. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_CHAOS_Arc_Dip_Chaos_Acceptance_Positive_02	This is well, friend, the Chaos Gods are pleased - I can feel it. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_CHAOS_Arc_Dip_Chaos_Rejection_Negative_01	I have no use for you. You shall be slaughtered and your forces subsumed by mine own. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_CHAOS_Arc_Dip_Chaos_Rejection_Negative_02	No, I care not for your warband of dogs. Get from here, before I send the Swords of Chaos to do my will. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_CHAOS_Arc_Dip_Chaos_Rejection_Neutral_01	No, you bring nothing but mongrels. It is tribes such as the Kurgan I need, not this maggoty stock. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_CHAOS_Arc_Dip_Chaos_Rejection_Neutral_02	You play at war, boy, but this is a man's game. You are not worthy of that mark upon your neck! 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_CHAOS_Arc_Dip_Chaos_Rejection_Positive_01	No, you seek my titles, not my favour. Your end will be miserable for that. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_CHAOS_Arc_Dip_Chaos_Rejection_Positive_02	You interrupt my plans, with your pathetic whimpers. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_CHAOS_Arc_Dip_Dwarf_Acceptance_Negative_01	I'll agree Dwarf, just to see you shamed before all your stunted race. Chaos will always triumph! 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_CHAOS_Arc_Dip_Dwarf_Acceptance_Negative_02	Very well, Dawi-scum, tell your self-important kings that the Everchosen ascents. Your souls are mine! 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_CHAOS_Arc_Dip_Dwarf_Acceptance_Neutral_01	Ai, Dwarfs, we have a contract. I pray you break it, so I may reap a bloody revenge through the Karak Ankor! 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_CHAOS_Arc_Dip_Dwarf_Acceptance_Neutral_02	Yes, and I'll have the soul of every Son of Grungni in payment. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_CHAOS_Arc_Dip_Dwarf_Acceptance_Positive_01	I'll have your honour sealed in mine own grimoire, Dwarf. Such irony don't you think? 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_CHAOS_Arc_Dip_Dwarf_Acceptance_Positive_02	To see the abasement and cowering of Dwarfs, the Ruinous Powers will be pleased! 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_CHAOS_Arc_Dip_Dwarf_Rejection_Negative_01	Stunted-scum, you offer me nothing, I cannot take with such little effort. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_CHAOS_Arc_Dip_Dwarf_Rejection_Negative_02	The Grudgebearer is desperate! When I see your High King, I will knock him off his little stone chair! 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_CHAOS_Arc_Dip_Dwarf_Rejection_Neutral_01	No, Dwarfs. My counter-offer is your utter destruction!	false
diplomacy_strings_string_CHAOS_Arc_Dip_Dwarf_Rejection_Neutral_02	Not this time, Dwarf, or ever. Flee back to the mountains and cower in your halls - for I come! 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_CHAOS_Arc_Dip_Dwarf_Rejection_Positive_01	Ha - what a strange prospect! Have you turned to your kin in the Dark Lands for advice! 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_CHAOS_Arc_Dip_Dwarf_Rejection_Positive_02	Why would I even need to ally with you, honourless creatures? 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_CHAOS_Arc_Dip_Empire_Acceptance_Negative_01	So be it, but remember, pacts are ephemeral, mortal, and I have been awaiting your extinction for over a century! 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_CHAOS_Arc_Dip_Empire_Acceptance_Negative_02	I will ascent, but know that I was once one of you - I know Sigmar's secret - the thing Volkmar dare not say! You are all damned!	false
diplomacy_strings_string_CHAOS_Arc_Dip_Empire_Acceptance_Neutral_01	So be it - a pact with Sigmar's inbred progeny. The fates mock us! 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_CHAOS_Arc_Dip_Empire_Acceptance_Neutral_02	It serves me to work with this Franz, but I will have his head - that is a promise and I never break those. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_CHAOS_Arc_Dip_Empire_Acceptance_Positive_01	Very well - we have a temporary alliance, at best. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_CHAOS_Arc_Dip_Empire_Acceptance_Positive_02	Haha! Yes, Tzeentch truly works in intricate ways! 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_CHAOS_Arc_Dip_Empire_Rejection_Negative_01	Craven fools! I am Lord of the End Times - there is no offer! No pact! My only promise is your utter destruction! 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_CHAOS_Arc_Dip_Empire_Rejection_Negative_02	The Empire is dead! Soon your cities will be ransacked, your citizens maimed and praying for my mercy! 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_CHAOS_Arc_Dip_Empire_Rejection_Neutral_01	Do you take me for some simpering fool? Of course there is no alliance - I have but to order it and the Empire will fall! 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_CHAOS_Arc_Dip_Empire_Rejection_Neutral_02	No, not now or ever, run back to your preening Emperor and tell him the true master of mankind comes. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_CHAOS_Arc_Dip_Empire_Rejection_Positive_01	What blinkered fools, to come here! I'll let you live on condition you spread this message: your pitiful Empire will burn! 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_CHAOS_Arc_Dip_Empire_Rejection_Positive_02	No, there is only one choice, proclaim Chaos as your true masters, or see your souls… wither. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_CHAOS_Arc_Dip_Greenskin_Acceptance_Negative_01	I suppose it serves the Gods to make pact. But I'd sooner wipe every last stinking Greenskin out! 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_CHAOS_Arc_Dip_Greenskin_Acceptance_Negative_02	Yes. For now we have an agreement, Orc beast. But I do hope you betray me, so I may kill your entire tribe! 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_CHAOS_Arc_Dip_Greenskin_Acceptance_Neutral_01	Good, the Orcs shall ride with Chaos, but then the Greenskins will fall before my blade when I tire of them. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_CHAOS_Arc_Dip_Greenskin_Acceptance_Neutral_02	I see an alliance could work, but tell your Boss, Orc, that I expect utter obedience - anything less will lead to your deaths. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_CHAOS_Arc_Dip_Greenskin_Acceptance_Positive_01	Agreed, your Orcs have certain… uses.	false
diplomacy_strings_string_CHAOS_Arc_Dip_Greenskin_Acceptance_Positive_02	I will use your hordes, my Lord Khorne, has a certain affection for you, beasts. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_CHAOS_Arc_Dip_Greenskin_Rejection_Negative_01	No, Orc, never will I lower myself to work with your insipid kind! 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_CHAOS_Arc_Dip_Greenskin_Rejection_Negative_02	Not this time, Orc. Get this thing from my sight! Feed it to the spawn! 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_CHAOS_Arc_Dip_Greenskin_Rejection_Neutral_01	I tire of Greenskins! They are insects that will not die no matter how many times they are stamped upon!	false
diplomacy_strings_string_CHAOS_Arc_Dip_Greenskin_Rejection_Neutral_02	No, Orc, your race interests me less than the bearded troglodytes. And that is saying something! 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_CHAOS_Arc_Dip_Greenskin_Rejection_Positive_01	No, Greenskin, just because you slaughter the humans, do not mistake this for acquiescence on my part. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_CHAOS_Arc_Dip_Greenskin_Rejection_Positive_02	I doubt there is any need for a pact. Even your base souls belong to Chaos. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_CHAOS_Arc_Dip_Rejection_Negative_01	NEVER! To even suggest this brings upon a wrath that will see everything you hold dear reduced to ashes!	false
diplomacy_strings_string_CHAOS_Arc_Dip_Rejection_Negative_02	No, your armies will be obliterated as punishment!	false
diplomacy_strings_string_CHAOS_Arc_Dip_Rejection_Negative_03	I am Chaos - more powerful than the Gods themselves, you'll see!!!	false
diplomacy_strings_string_CHAOS_Arc_Dip_Rejection_Neutral_01	You seek a deal with forces you do not understand, mortal. For that I must teach you a lesson. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_CHAOS_Arc_Dip_Rejection_Neutral_02	Look upon the Crown of Domination and know that I will soon seek your doom. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_CHAOS_Arc_Dip_Rejection_Neutral_03	No, the Everchosen requires no such alliance! 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_CHAOS_Arc_Dip_Rejection_Positive_01	You vex me… for your soul's sake, that is not wise. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_CHAOS_Arc_Dip_Rejection_Positive_02	I will let it go this once. The Dark Gods have plans for you. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_CHAOS_Arc_Dip_Rejection_Positive_03	Ha! You think this matters to me? You are very wrong. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_CHAOS_Arc_Dip_Vampire_Acceptance_Negative_01	Very well, but I will rip the face off any liche that gets in my way!	false
diplomacy_strings_string_CHAOS_Arc_Dip_Vampire_Acceptance_Negative_02	So be it, maggot king. But be warned, Father Nurgle knows more about death than you ever will. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_CHAOS_Arc_Dip_Vampire_Acceptance_Neutral_01	So be it. Chaos legions with your rotting puppets. What could possibly go wrong? 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_CHAOS_Arc_Dip_Vampire_Acceptance_Neutral_02	I ascent. Do not mistake this for anything but convenience, Vampire. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_CHAOS_Arc_Dip_Vampire_Acceptance_Positive_01	Very well, my hordes will work with your shambling things… for now. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_CHAOS_Arc_Dip_Vampire_Acceptance_Positive_02	Yes, that is an accord signed in blood, such things matter to you?	false
diplomacy_strings_string_CHAOS_Arc_Dip_Vampire_Rejection_Negative_01	Never! I am noble, enshrined by my crown, but you are nothing - a corpse that doesn't ever realise it has ceased. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_CHAOS_Arc_Dip_Vampire_Rejection_Negative_02	The very idea disgusts me. Go back to your minions, puppeteer, and prepare for your doom. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_CHAOS_Arc_Dip_Vampire_Rejection_Neutral_01	Why would I ally with grave-feeders and their pet liches. I have the full might of the Ruinous Powers at my command! 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_CHAOS_Arc_Dip_Vampire_Rejection_Neutral_02	No, your master is Nagash. I would destroy him with nary a look - so why should I fear your wrath?	false
diplomacy_strings_string_CHAOS_Arc_Dip_Vampire_Rejection_Positive_01	While I can admire your limited abilities, I have no use for you. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_CHAOS_Arc_Dip_Vampire_Rejection_Positive_02	It is true we share some dark desires, yet you wish to rule the mortals. That will not be, for I desire their obliteration!	false
diplomacy_strings_string_CHAOS_Dip_Accept_State_Gift_01	Such pointless baubles… put it on the pile with the rest of the plunder. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_CHAOS_Dip_Accept_State_Gift_02	I'll take your gift, but it's your souls I want!	false
diplomacy_strings_string_CHAOS_Dip_Accept_State_Gift_03	How gracious… but if you think this trifling thing will appease my masters then you are mistaken… 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_CHAOS_Dip_Acknowledge_Accept_01	We have a pact. You will not regret this… 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_CHAOS_Dip_Acknowledge_Accept_02	Good, Tzeentch will be pleased! 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_CHAOS_Dip_Acknowledge_Accept_03	Praise to the Raven God! We shall sacrifice nine hundred and ninety-nine souls in celebration!	false
diplomacy_strings_string_CHAOS_Dip_Acknowledge_Cancel_Treaty_01	You do not break a pact with Chaos! 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_CHAOS_Dip_Acknowledge_Cancel_Treaty_02	To cancel a treaty with Chaos - you are either brave or a fool. I'd wager the latter. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_CHAOS_Dip_Acknowledge_Cancel_Treaty_03	Breaking this agreement is to make an enemy of the Dark Powers. To have your name upon the lips of a God and spoken in hatred… Your soul is doomed. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_CHAOS_Dip_Acknowledge_Reject_01	To reject such an offer is to make sworn enemies of the Dark Powers. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_CHAOS_Dip_Acknowledge_Reject_02	If you are sure… my masters have eternity to make you change your mind. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_CHAOS_Dip_Acknowledge_Reject_03	Ahh, the puppy barks its defiance. Should we put it out of its misery? 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_CHAOS_Dip_Acknowledge_War_01	Then Khorne will reap your souls! 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_CHAOS_Dip_Acknowledge_War_02	There will be much blood for the Blood God this day. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_CHAOS_Dip_Acknowledge_War_03	Our master, Khorne, rejoices! War is His domain. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_CHAOS_Dip_Cancel_Treaty_01	There is no profit for my masters in this. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_CHAOS_Dip_Cancel_Treaty_02	This contract is at an end, we will collect the souls in any case. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_CHAOS_Dip_Cancel_Treaty_03	This treaty is dead, as are you… 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_CHAOS_Dip_Demand_Join_War_01	Join us, for we all will reap the benefits! 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_CHAOS_Dip_Demand_Join_War_02	Do not let your distaste for the north stop you from joining us in battle. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_CHAOS_Dip_Demand_Join_War_03	Come, let us make war together and the Blood God will bless us all. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_CHAOS_Dip_Demand_Payments_Negative_01	Your tally is due!	false
diplomacy_strings_string_CHAOS_Dip_Demand_Payments_Neutral_01	We will have payment in valuables, delay any longer and it will be your souls! 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_CHAOS_Dip_Demand_Payments_Positive_01	I'm sure an accommodation can be reached. After all, our masters have little need for gold and other gimcracks. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_CHAOS_Dip_Generic_Offer_Bretonnia_Negative_01	Hear me, man. Your water-witch cannot help you now. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_CHAOS_Dip_Generic_Offer_Bretonnia_Negative_02	Your lands will be ashes, so hear us now! 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_CHAOS_Dip_Generic_Offer_Bretonnia_Neutral_01	Come Bretonnian, accept our offer and delay the suffering of your people. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_CHAOS_Dip_Generic_Offer_Bretonnia_Neutral_02	The lands of the Bretons are doomed! You must know that… 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_CHAOS_Dip_Generic_Offer_Bretonnia_Positive_01	Let us drink your wine, mortal, and together we can hammer out a pact. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_CHAOS_Dip_Generic_Offer_Bretonnia_Positive_02	So, do you wish to know the horrifying truth about your parochial god? 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_CHAOS_Dip_Generic_Offer_Chaos_Negative_01	Insignificant Chieftain! Hear me!	false
diplomacy_strings_string_CHAOS_Dip_Generic_Offer_Chaos_Negative_02	Bow before your superior, take my offer and be dominated!	false
diplomacy_strings_string_CHAOS_Dip_Generic_Offer_Chaos_Neutral_01	I have an offer for you, champion.	false

diplomacy_strings_string_CHAOS_Lord1_Dip_Acceptance_Neutral_02	Very well, there will be consequences of course. The gifts of the Gods are rarely… unobtrusive. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_CHAOS_Lord1_Dip_Acceptance_Neutral_03	We have an alliance. Do not think to renege. That is not the done thing… at least until I betray you first. 	false

diplomacy_strings_string_CHAOS_Lord1_Dip_Bretonnia_Acceptance_Positive_02	Good, yes, why do you kneel so easily, Bretonnian? No fight left in you? 	false

diplomacy_strings_string_CHAOS_Lord1_Dip_Chaos_Acceptance_Negative_01	Yes, the invasion beings! Know that as the strongest of us I dominate the horde! 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_CHAOS_Lord1_Dip_Chaos_Acceptance_Negative_02	An alliance is possible, but the Gods demand I control it! 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_CHAOS_Lord1_Dip_Chaos_Acceptance_Neutral_01	Of course, we should ally - we bring the End Times that much closer if we do. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_CHAOS_Lord1_Dip_Chaos_Acceptance_Neutral_02	Yes, but I demand acknowledgement before the Gods for this sacrifice! 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_CHAOS_Lord1_Dip_Chaos_Acceptance_Positive_01	Yes, unleash the Warshrines! We bring glory to the Gods. 	false

diplomacy_strings_string_CHAOS_Lord1_Dip_Chaos_Rejection_Neutral_02	You bring shame upon the Northmen! For that I will have your head! 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_CHAOS_Lord1_Dip_Chaos_Rejection_Positive_01	This is not Tzeentch's will - I don't need to be a sorcerer to tell you that. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_CHAOS_Lord1_Dip_Chaos_Rejection_Positive_02	No, the Blue Scribes have spoken - this is not meant to be. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_CHAOS_Lord1_Dip_Dwarf_Acceptance_Negative_01	I suppose, but should you stunted cretins think to betray me, know that I'll have already considered it!	false
diplomacy_strings_string_CHAOS_Lord1_Dip_Dwarf_Acceptance_Negative_02	Very well, Dwarfs, a pact for now. Your time is coming anyway. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_CHAOS_Lord1_Dip_Dwarf_Acceptance_Neutral_01	Yes, Dwarf, an alliance - for yours is a realm I'll take soon enough anyway. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_CHAOS_Lord1_Dip_Dwarf_Acceptance_Neutral_02	A pact then. As we destroy your so-called honour, we weaken the soul of every Dawi.  	false
diplomacy_strings_string_CHAOS_Lord1_Dip_Dwarf_Acceptance_Positive_01	Yes, it cheers me to see you lose your honour. For that we can come to terms. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_CHAOS_Lord1_Dip_Dwarf_Acceptance_Positive_02	Agreed - you drive as hard a bargain as your cousins in the Dark Lands. You are closer to them than you care to admit. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_CHAOS_Lord1_Dip_Dwarf_Rejection_Negative_01	No, stunted fools. There is nothing you can offer the Chaos Gods but your inevitably destruction. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_CHAOS_Lord1_Dip_Dwarf_Rejection_Negative_02	Dwarf-scum, the answer is no, but the path to destruction is now clear, the Karaz Ankor will fall. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_CHAOS_Lord1_Dip_Dwarf_Rejection_Neutral_01	No, Dwarfs - there is no solace for you here, just the destruction of your faded kingdoms!	false
diplomacy_strings_string_CHAOS_Lord1_Dip_Dwarf_Rejection_Neutral_02	My Gods demand that we drink Dwarf blood this night!	false
diplomacy_strings_string_CHAOS_Lord1_Dip_Dwarf_Rejection_Positive_01	No - The Grudgebearer's Age of Reckoning ends here. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_CHAOS_Lord1_Dip_Dwarf_Rejection_Positive_02	I think not, Dawi - your hold over the mountains is at an end. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_CHAOS_Lord1_Dip_Empire_Acceptance_Negative_01	I'll have hostages to secure my terms! Should you renege they will not just die, but become spawn!	false
diplomacy_strings_string_CHAOS_Lord1_Dip_Empire_Acceptance_Negative_02	Yes, but this changes nothing! Valten and Franz - both will be dead by my hand! 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_CHAOS_Lord1_Dip_Empire_Acceptance_Neutral_01	Yes, we will ally, it matters not - all will fall before Khorne and his brothers in time. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_CHAOS_Lord1_Dip_Empire_Acceptance_Neutral_02	There are those who would shun me for this pact, but a Lord of Change assures me this is the correct path!	false
diplomacy_strings_string_CHAOS_Lord1_Dip_Empire_Acceptance_Positive_01	Yes, why not! We will destroy our mutual foes before we claim your souls as well. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_CHAOS_Lord1_Dip_Empire_Acceptance_Positive_02	Agreed, the terms are set. I wonder for your sake if you have made a grave mistake, Empire man? 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_CHAOS_Lord1_Dip_Empire_Rejection_Negative_01	No, for the Empire's days are numbered - within your lifetimes you will know true hell. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_CHAOS_Lord1_Dip_Empire_Rejection_Negative_02	Never! As long as I wear this armour I will not ally with southern filth!	false
diplomacy_strings_string_CHAOS_Lord1_Dip_Empire_Rejection_Neutral_01	No, the Empire stands on its own, making its fall all the more delicious. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_CHAOS_Lord1_Dip_Empire_Rejection_Neutral_02	We are enemies, maggot! There will be no pact with men of the Old World. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_CHAOS_Lord1_Dip_Empire_Rejection_Positive_01	No, the only offer I'll hear is your Emperor begging for his soul on the steps of the Sigmarite temple! 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_CHAOS_Lord1_Dip_Empire_Rejection_Positive_02	No, the time of man is at an end! Now, go back to your nation and tell all that Chaos is coming. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_CHAOS_Lord1_Dip_Greenskin_Acceptance_Negative_01	Alright! For once I will ally with the Orcs. This way we can channel their aggression and serve Khorne. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_CHAOS_Lord1_Dip_Greenskin_Acceptance_Negative_02	Yes, Greenskin, a treaty - if you even understand the concept! 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_CHAOS_Lord1_Dip_Greenskin_Acceptance_Neutral_01	So be it, Greenskins and Northmen - an alliance doomed to fail, but I'll take advantage while I can. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_CHAOS_Lord1_Dip_Greenskin_Acceptance_Neutral_02	Yes, then when you are finished - we'll take your base souls as well. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_CHAOS_Lord1_Dip_Greenskin_Acceptance_Positive_01	Good - the green hordes and the Ruinous Powers shall be as one!	false
diplomacy_strings_string_CHAOS_Lord1_Dip_Greenskin_Acceptance_Positive_02	All to the good, Orc. Now which of your mobs will be sacrificed to Khorne?	false
diplomacy_strings_string_CHAOS_Lord1_Dip_Greenskin_Rejection_Negative_01	No - I will make your gods suffer for such insolence!	false
diplomacy_strings_string_CHAOS_Lord1_Dip_Greenskin_Rejection_Negative_02	Your entire green race will soon be at an end. I look forward to that time more than any other! 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_CHAOS_Lord1_Dip_Greenskin_Rejection_Neutral_01	There is no pact! There never will be, my Gods would turn me to Spawn for even thinking it! 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_CHAOS_Lord1_Dip_Greenskin_Rejection_Neutral_02	No, I do not work with beasts - unless they're formed in the Gods' image. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_CHAOS_Lord1_Dip_Greenskin_Rejection_Positive_01	You mistake leniency for approval, Orc. That is your last mistake! 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_CHAOS_Lord1_Dip_Greenskin_Rejection_Positive_02	A pathetic offer! It is rejected along with all of your sorry race. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_CHAOS_Lord1_Dip_Rejection_Negative_01	You mock me, and for that there will be no mercy! I pledge your murder before the Skull Throne!	false
diplomacy_strings_string_CHAOS_Lord1_Dip_Rejection_Negative_02	You are a fool, more than a fool - an utter wretch, whose soul will know torment for all eternity! 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_CHAOS_Lord1_Dip_Rejection_Negative_03	The stupidity of your masters knows no bounds, and for that you'll pay with your derisory life. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_CHAOS_Lord1_Dip_Rejection_Neutral_01	Flee if you must - no matter where you run we will find you and harvest your soul! 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_CHAOS_Lord1_Dip_Rejection_Neutral_02	No, there is no need for subtlety here. Khorne rages! We must have slaughter! 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_CHAOS_Lord1_Dip_Rejection_Neutral_03	Hahaha! You surely jest? There is no bartering with a Lord of Chaos! 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_CHAOS_Lord1_Dip_Rejection_Positive_01	Yours is a poor lot - for I will take your life and all those you hold dearest. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_CHAOS_Lord1_Dip_Rejection_Positive_02	No, there is no deal to be struck here. The Gods have no use for you or your kin. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_CHAOS_Lord1_Dip_Rejection_Positive_03	So it falls to me to provide my Gods with a bountiful harvest, and it is not grain I reap… 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_CHAOS_Lord1_Dip_Vampire_Acceptance_Negative_01	Your threats are meaningless, grave-feeder. We will work together for it suits me. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_CHAOS_Lord1_Dip_Vampire_Acceptance_Negative_02	Yes, there is profit for Nurgle in this. The rotting corpses make perfect carriers - I will take command. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_CHAOS_Lord1_Dip_Vampire_Acceptance_Neutral_01	Yes, this works. Together we will rid the world of mortals… and death. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_CHAOS_Lord1_Dip_Vampire_Acceptance_Neutral_02	Yes, but there are terms. My masters demand recompense for slaying so many potential followers. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_CHAOS_Lord1_Dip_Vampire_Acceptance_Positive_01	Yes, our forces can work together. You take their bodies, I'll claim their souls. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_CHAOS_Lord1_Dip_Vampire_Acceptance_Positive_02	Very well, we will share the plunder, but I have no use for trinkets or bones. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_CHAOS_Lord1_Dip_Vampire_Rejection_Negative_01	No, you may shun the weakling god, Morr, but my masters are far harder to avoid. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_CHAOS_Lord1_Dip_Vampire_Rejection_Negative_02	Never! There is no place for you or your rotting ilk. Even Father Nurgle rejects your advances.  	false
diplomacy_strings_string_CHAOS_Lord1_Dip_Vampire_Rejection_Neutral_01	Not this time, Vampire. Now go and play with your corpses, let the true Dark Lord go about his business. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_CHAOS_Lord1_Dip_Vampire_Rejection_Neutral_02	This is not your time, Vampire. These are the End Times, and your feeble race plays no part in them! 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_CHAOS_Lord1_Dip_Vampire_Rejection_Positive_01	I think not - all destruction will be in tribute to the Ruinous Powers! 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_CHAOS_Lord1_Dip_Vampire_Rejection_Positive_02	We have no time to hash out any agreement with the Undead, Khorne thirsts for blood and battle! 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_CHAOS_Marauder_Dip_Generic_Offer_Yuri_Negative_01	That is the offer, Ungol!	false
diplomacy_strings_string_CHAOS_Marauder_Dip_Generic_Offer_Yuri_Negative_02	Take it, southerner! 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_CHAOS_Marauder_Dip_Generic_Offer_Yuri_Neutral_01	The tribute is before you. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_CHAOS_Marauder_Dip_Generic_Offer_Yuri_Neutral_02	There is nothing else.	false
diplomacy_strings_string_CHAOS_Marauder_Dip_Generic_Offer_Yuri_Positive_01	 A generous offer.	false
diplomacy_strings_string_CHAOS_Marauder_Dip_Generic_Offer_Yuri_Positive_02	The Dark Gods smile on this pact.	false
diplomacy_strings_string_CHAOS_Marauder_Dip_Offer_Cooperation_Yuri_01	We will share blood and spoils!	false
diplomacy_strings_string_CHAOS_Marauder_Dip_Offer_Cooperation_Yuri_02	You are fortunate we have agreed to this.	false
diplomacy_strings_string_CHAOS_Marauder_Dip_Offer_Peace_Yuri_01	We want peace, for now.	false
diplomacy_strings_string_CHAOS_Marauder_Dip_Offer_Peace_Yuri_02	Enough blood has been spilt.	false
diplomacy_strings_string_CHAOS_Marauder_Dip_Reject_Peace_Yuri_01	Never, the Hound demands blood!	false
diplomacy_strings_string_CHAOS_Marauder_Dip_Reject_Peace_Yuri_02	There is no peace among us! 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_CHAOS_Marauder_Dip_War_Yuri_01	It must be war!	false
diplomacy_strings_string_CHAOS_Marauder_Dip_War_Yuri_02	Pray to your god. War comes!	false
diplomacy_strings_string_CHAOS_Marauder_Dip_Yuri_Acceptance_Neutral_01	So, Ungol, we have a blood pact.	false
diplomacy_strings_string_CHAOS_Marauder_Dip_Yuri_Acceptance_Neutral_02	We shall share glory!	false
diplomacy_strings_string_CHAOS_Marauder_Dip_Yuri_Acceptance_Neutral_03	If this is the only way…	false
diplomacy_strings_string_CHAOS_Marauder_Dip_Yuri_Greet_Neg_01	I will not bargain with a mongrel-prince of the south.	false
diplomacy_strings_string_CHAOS_Marauder_Dip_Yuri_Greet_Neg_02	We've heard your God-Bear. He whimpers in the wind.	false
diplomacy_strings_string_CHAOS_Marauder_Dip_Yuri_Greet_Neg_03	State your demand, Ungol… or do you need your queen’s permission?	false
diplomacy_strings_string_CHAOS_Marauder_Dip_Yuri_Greet_Neu_01	You trespass, Ungol. What toll will you pay to avoid punishment?	false
diplomacy_strings_string_CHAOS_Marauder_Dip_Yuri_Greet_Neu_02	Do you offer tribute or wergild? There is a cost when you speak with the tribes.    	false
diplomacy_strings_string_CHAOS_Marauder_Dip_Yuri_Greet_Neu_03	I will listen… I see power in you. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_CHAOS_Marauder_Dip_Yuri_Rejection_Neutral_01	I will not deal with a Kislevite!	false
diplomacy_strings_string_CHAOS_Marauder_Dip_Yuri_Rejection_Neutral_02	Never, my God will devour yours!	false
diplomacy_strings_string_CHAOS_Marauder_Dip_Yuri_Rejection_Neutral_03	Trespassers, be gone!	false
diplomacy_strings_string_CHAOS_MrdrChief_Dip_Acceptance_Negative_01	You forget yourself… I will take this pact, but know that your tribute is the soul of every being you command. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_CHAOS_MrdrChief_Dip_Acceptance_Negative_02	It shall be - my masters will visit you shortly. Guard your dreams. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_CHAOS_MrdrChief_Dip_Acceptance_Negative_03	It is done, my tribes will work with yours. Betray me and you will feel the vengeance of the Norse. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_CHAOS_MrdrChief_Dip_Acceptance_Neutral_01	The pact is sealed. We will share many gifts.	false
diplomacy_strings_string_CHAOS_MrdrChief_Dip_Acceptance_Neutral_02	Yes, but do not flinch at the sigils I show you - they are the marks of our masters and soon you will sport one yourself!	false
diplomacy_strings_string_CHAOS_MrdrChief_Dip_Acceptance_Neutral_03	You have the support of the Vargs and Skaelings - but the Sarls reject you! 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_CHAOS_MrdrChief_Dip_Acceptance_Positive_01	Yes, we will take to our longships! 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_CHAOS_MrdrChief_Dip_Acceptance_Positive_02	Ha! A tribal moot is called - I shall summon the Skaelings to war! 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_CHAOS_MrdrChief_Dip_Acceptance_Positive_03	Good, our Gods visited upon us many blessings this night - a sign that they are in favour of this! 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_CHAOS_MrdrChief_Dip_Rejection_Negative_01	No - your destiny lies on the Altar of the Crimson Harvest!  	false
diplomacy_strings_string_CHAOS_MrdrChief_Dip_Rejection_Negative_02	No, yours is a great sacrifice - one I shall enjoy eeking out of you! 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_CHAOS_MrdrChief_Dip_Rejection_Negative_03	Never - the fleets of Norsca will take to the seas and we will find your realm, cur! 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_CHAOS_MrdrChief_Dip_Rejection_Neutral_01	Get from these frozen lands, before the Slaughterbrutes and Ice Drakes catch your fetid scent! 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_CHAOS_MrdrChief_Dip_Rejection_Neutral_02	Yours is a fool's treaty - you think you can mock us and not pay with your soul? 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_CHAOS_MrdrChief_Dip_Rejection_Neutral_03	No - there is no bargain, no barter without your souls as surety!	false
diplomacy_strings_string_CHAOS_MrdrChief_Dip_Rejection_Positive_01	No, return to your tribe and tell them that the Norse have no masters but our Gods! 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_CHAOS_MrdrChief_Dip_Rejection_Positive_02	Your tributes are poor - there is no pact! 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_CHAOS_MrdrChief_Dip_Rejection_Positive_03	Get back across the Sea of Claws, southlander, we will follow you soon enough! 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_CHAOS_NorseSorceLord1_Dip_Acceptance_Negative_01	So it is. The Eagle calls and persuades me, but I will still see you on a spit! 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_CHAOS_NorseSorceLord1_Dip_Acceptance_Negative_02	Yes, that is the will of the Chaos Gods, yet they have promised we can feast on your bones afterwards. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_CHAOS_NorseSorceLord1_Dip_Acceptance_Negative_03	Agreed, but the tribes of Norsca never forget! 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_CHAOS_NorseSorceLord1_Dip_Acceptance_Neutral_01	Yes, the tribes shall come together - there will be a great feast and much blood spilt! 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_CHAOS_NorseSorceLord1_Dip_Acceptance_Neutral_02	The Chaos Gods grant me much power and through it I know this offer is good. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_CHAOS_NorseSorceLord1_Dip_Acceptance_Neutral_03	The covenant is signed, you forfeit your lives and more if you break it! 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_CHAOS_NorseSorceLord1_Dip_Acceptance_Positive_01	There is consensus amongst the north men. They accept. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_CHAOS_NorseSorceLord1_Dip_Acceptance_Positive_02	I have divined an answer from the Gods - they agree. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_CHAOS_NorseSorceLord1_Dip_Acceptance_Positive_03	I look into the fire pit and the flames shape into agreement.  	false
diplomacy_strings_string_CHAOS_NorseSorceLord1_Dip_Rejection_Negative_01	Now is the time the tribes march south - it is too late for your petty treaties! 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_CHAOS_NorseSorceLord1_Dip_Rejection_Negative_02	Fear us - fear the wrath of Chaos and all Northmen! 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_CHAOS_NorseSorceLord1_Dip_Rejection_Negative_03	So like southerners to talk instead of fight - you'll see how Northmen answer! 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_CHAOS_NorseSorceLord1_Dip_Rejection_Neutral_01	I have received a Manticore's sting. It provides me with great visions in which I see your traitorous acts! 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_CHAOS_NorseSorceLord1_Dip_Rejection_Neutral_02	The tribes gather, but they will not sign any pact with you! 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_CHAOS_NorseSorceLord1_Dip_Rejection_Neutral_03	A weakling and a fool, that is what I see before me. Go and tell your masters the Norse come for you all! 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_CHAOS_NorseSorceLord1_Dip_Rejection_Positive_01	Hmm, the tribes are not so easily swayed, it'll take more than that. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_CHAOS_NorseSorceLord1_Dip_Rejection_Positive_02	I speak for the Norscan tribes, and we deny your petty offer.	false
diplomacy_strings_string_CHAOS_NorseSorceLord1_Dip_Rejection_Positive_03	A trifling offer - a larger tribute is required. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_CHAOS_Sig_Dip_Acceptance_Negative_01	So it shall be. Now go – your repellence sours my mood.	false
diplomacy_strings_string_CHAOS_Sig_Dip_Acceptance_Negative_02	Agreed, I suppose – tell me, how do you live looking like that?	false
diplomacy_strings_string_CHAOS_Sig_Dip_Acceptance_Negative_03	You make pact with Chaos. A strange choice, idiotic even, but then you are desperate, yes?	false
diplomacy_strings_string_CHAOS_Sig_Dip_Acceptance_Neutral_01	Hmm, yes, very well. Maybe we can make the colours work, and will be able to ally.	false
diplomacy_strings_string_CHAOS_Sig_Dip_Acceptance_Neutral_02	We have agreement – I just need a little soul we could sacrifice to father, do you have one?	false
diplomacy_strings_string_CHAOS_Sig_Dip_Acceptance_Neutral_03	Yes, we have an accord, now please go. Your horrid presence puts me in such a bad mood.	false
diplomacy_strings_string_CHAOS_Sig_Dip_Acceptance_Positive_01	This is fortuitous news, for I would have had to murder you if no agreement was struck.	false
diplomacy_strings_string_CHAOS_Sig_Dip_Acceptance_Positive_02	Excellent, let's us decant the wine, and drink to this accord.	false
diplomacy_strings_string_CHAOS_Sig_Dip_Acceptance_Positive_03	Yes, now, together, let's thank my father – he would appreciate it.	false
diplomacy_strings_string_CHAOS_Sig_Dip_Bretonnia_Acceptance_Negative_01	If it pleases my master, which it does – but I don't like this. It angers me… such an ugly emotion.	false
diplomacy_strings_string_CHAOS_Sig_Dip_Bretonnia_Acceptance_Negative_02	Very well, I agree but have no doubt, Bretonnian, I'll make your nation suffer for this!	false
diplomacy_strings_string_CHAOS_Sig_Dip_Bretonnia_Acceptance_Neutral_01	Agreed, but if I see just one filthy peasant the contract is void and I'll kill thousands as penalty.	false
diplomacy_strings_string_CHAOS_Sig_Dip_Bretonnia_Acceptance_Neutral_02	A good offer, I shall have to ponder it… yes, very well. Bring us wine, let us bless… this union.	false
diplomacy_strings_string_CHAOS_Sig_Dip_Bretonnia_Acceptance_Positive_01	I'll accept, but I may have to kill many of you if you get in my way.	false
diplomacy_strings_string_CHAOS_Sig_Dip_Bretonnia_Acceptance_Positive_02	You flatter me, sirs – or is that just my reflection in yon armour. Yes, we have a pact.	false
diplomacy_strings_string_CHAOS_Sig_Dip_Bretonnia_Rejection_Negative_01	You mock me? To even ask for such a boon is to sign your death papers!	false
diplomacy_strings_string_CHAOS_Sig_Dip_Bretonnia_Rejection_Negative_02	No, and now you'll pay – Sliverslash will not rest until it is covered in the blood of Bretonnia!	false
diplomacy_strings_string_CHAOS_Sig_Dip_Bretonnia_Rejection_Neutral_01	No, take your damsels and Knights and be gone from my presence. The whole thing is depressing me.	false
diplomacy_strings_string_CHAOS_Sig_Dip_Bretonnia_Rejection_Neutral_02	By all the Gods of Chaos, no, and thrice, no. I have far too much fun killing all of you.	false
diplomacy_strings_string_CHAOS_Sig_Dip_Bretonnia_Rejection_Positive_01	No, you are a nation of preening fools. I can't have any such competition!	false
diplomacy_strings_string_CHAOS_Sig_Dip_Bretonnia_Rejection_Positive_02	I fear not, while your vainglory suits my own, our thoughts of what chivalry is are quite different.	false
diplomacy_strings_string_CHAOS_Sig_Dip_Chaos_Acceptance_Negative_01	Yes, we will merge as one, but know that I command, as is my right as the Geld-Prince!	false
diplomacy_strings_string_CHAOS_Sig_Dip_Chaos_Acceptance_Negative_02	The followers of Chaos have as many fools in them as the southerners! Yet, we must work together.	false
diplomacy_strings_string_CHAOS_Sig_Dip_Chaos_Acceptance_Neutral_01	You have secured the services of the Geld-Prince of Slaanesh. Please, do offer thanks and prayers – it all helps.	false
diplomacy_strings_string_CHAOS_Sig_Dip_Chaos_Acceptance_Neutral_02	Your sycophantic pandering has been noted. We have a pact.	false
diplomacy_strings_string_CHAOS_Sig_Dip_Chaos_Acceptance_Positive_01	Yes, let us entwine our hordes. You will, of course, submit to my overlordship, I do not have to ask nicely.	false
diplomacy_strings_string_CHAOS_Sig_Dip_Chaos_Acceptance_Positive_02	Yes, I feel a connection. My fawning servants assure me that killing you would be a bad thing, so I won't.	false
diplomacy_strings_string_CHAOS_Sig_Dip_Chaos_Rejection_Negative_01	Get from my presence, spawn! I will not sully my beautiful hands by cowing to your whims!	false
diplomacy_strings_string_CHAOS_Sig_Dip_Chaos_Rejection_Negative_02	I reject your offer, and reinforce my will with your head on a silver platter if I must!	false
diplomacy_strings_string_CHAOS_Sig_Dip_Chaos_Rejection_Neutral_01	I get a bad feeling from you – you wish to kill me? Do you truly wish to test how fast I am?	false
diplomacy_strings_string_CHAOS_Sig_Dip_Chaos_Rejection_Neutral_02	Go back to your masters and tell them, I'll see them in the seventy-seven hells before I acquiesce to their demands.	false
diplomacy_strings_string_CHAOS_Sig_Dip_Chaos_Rejection_Positive_01	Alas not. We would clash – I just know it.	false
diplomacy_strings_string_CHAOS_Sig_Dip_Chaos_Rejection_Positive_02	No, my Father-Prince is a jealous God, and I am his alone.	false
diplomacy_strings_string_CHAOS_Sig_Dip_Dwarf_Acceptance_Negative_01	How trying – I must work with the Dwarfs. Father-Prince must hate me!	false
diplomacy_strings_string_CHAOS_Sig_Dip_Dwarf_Acceptance_Negative_02	Gods! Why do you punish this perfect form? I have to make a pact with… Dwarfs!	false
diplomacy_strings_string_CHAOS_Sig_Dip_Dwarf_Acceptance_Neutral_01	Yes – the irony of your race, Dwarf, is you make beautiful things with such ugly hands.	false
diplomacy_strings_string_CHAOS_Sig_Dip_Dwarf_Acceptance_Neutral_02	Good, we will work together. You have surrendered your honour as I have my standards.	false
diplomacy_strings_string_CHAOS_Sig_Dip_Dwarf_Acceptance_Positive_01	Yes, an accord. But something must be done with this 'grumpy-dour' aesthetic.	false
diplomacy_strings_string_CHAOS_Sig_Dip_Dwarf_Acceptance_Positive_02	Very good, a change of pace to work with such ponderous creatures.	false
diplomacy_strings_string_CHAOS_Sig_Dip_Dwarf_Rejection_Negative_01	No… not in all my years have I sullied myself, and I do not intend to now. Be gone, Dwarf!	false
diplomacy_strings_string_CHAOS_Sig_Dip_Dwarf_Rejection_Negative_02	Tell your High-King that he and his filthy race will be scoured from the mountains! 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_CHAOS_Sig_Dip_Dwarf_Rejection_Neutral_01	I don't think so, Dwarf. Crawl back to your mountains and spare us all your hideous race.	false
diplomacy_strings_string_CHAOS_Sig_Dip_Dwarf_Rejection_Neutral_02	No, Dwarf, there is no deal to be struck, just the destruction of your precious empire.	false
diplomacy_strings_string_CHAOS_Sig_Dip_Dwarf_Rejection_Positive_01	No-no, how could I ally with you. I'd hurt my neck looking down all the time.	false
diplomacy_strings_string_CHAOS_Sig_Dip_Dwarf_Rejection_Positive_02	I apologise I just can't make this work! Better to wipe you out.	false
diplomacy_strings_string_CHAOS_Sig_Dip_Empire_Acceptance_Negative_01	So be it! I will ally with Sigmar's bastards. Let the Dark Prince judge if this is wise.	false
diplomacy_strings_string_CHAOS_Sig_Dip_Empire_Acceptance_Negative_02	A temporary alliance is all I'm will to ascent to. After all, your realm is not long for the world.	false
diplomacy_strings_string_CHAOS_Sig_Dip_Empire_Acceptance_Neutral_01	Yes – a treaty – my father seems very keen. But then he expects I'll betray you, and I wouldn't want to disappoint Him.	false
diplomacy_strings_string_CHAOS_Sig_Dip_Empire_Acceptance_Neutral_02	That will do, Sons of Sigmar, you have made your case – now we talk about the wergild owed.	false
diplomacy_strings_string_CHAOS_Sig_Dip_Empire_Acceptance_Positive_01	Very well, this suits my purposes.	false
diplomacy_strings_string_CHAOS_Sig_Dip_Empire_Acceptance_Positive_02	Agreed, but let us not get carried away.	false
diplomacy_strings_string_CHAOS_Sig_Dip_Empire_Rejection_Negative_01	Never! I will have this Franz prone at my feet, kissing my boots and praying to be ended!	false
diplomacy_strings_string_CHAOS_Sig_Dip_Empire_Rejection_Negative_02	No, I rarely show anger, for my perfection prevents me – but my rage is close, mortal…	false
diplomacy_strings_string_CHAOS_Sig_Dip_Empire_Rejection_Neutral_01	There is little point. That fool, Archaon – even my master has a soft spot for him - plans to decimate your lands.	false
diplomacy_strings_string_CHAOS_Sig_Dip_Empire_Rejection_Neutral_02	No, I never liked this Sigmar you all love so much. Seems like a right show off to me.	false
diplomacy_strings_string_CHAOS_Sig_Dip_Empire_Rejection_Positive_01	I know true value when I see it, my own reflection is but one example. So this is not good value.	false
diplomacy_strings_string_CHAOS_Sig_Dip_Empire_Rejection_Positive_02	I may be the acceptable face of the Chaos Legions, but don't mistake me for a soft touch, mortal, others have made that fatal mistake.	false
diplomacy_strings_string_CHAOS_Sig_Dip_Greenskin_Acceptance_Negative_01	A pact then! But only while it serves my interest, then I shall see you all exterminated.	false
diplomacy_strings_string_CHAOS_Sig_Dip_Greenskin_Acceptance_Negative_02	Yes, as much as it galls me! A curse on your filthy race all the same.	false
diplomacy_strings_string_CHAOS_Sig_Dip_Greenskin_Acceptance_Neutral_01	So we shall, but I have no patience for your kind. Betray me and you'll all be put to the blade.	false
diplomacy_strings_string_CHAOS_Sig_Dip_Greenskin_Acceptance_Neutral_02	Agreed – now get from my presence before I retch!	false
diplomacy_strings_string_CHAOS_Sig_Dip_Greenskin_Acceptance_Positive_01	Why not? After all, the most beautiful thing in the world is spilling blood, and these creatures do it so well.	false
diplomacy_strings_string_CHAOS_Sig_Dip_Greenskin_Acceptance_Positive_02	Yes, very well, as long as your brutes stay out of my sight, we have a pact.	false
diplomacy_strings_string_CHAOS_Sig_Dip_Greenskin_Rejection_Negative_01	Never, Orcs! Why would I even dream of tainting my hordes with your filth!	false
diplomacy_strings_string_CHAOS_Sig_Dip_Greenskin_Rejection_Negative_02	Sigvald the Magnificent does not work with Greenskins! That is all you need to know, worm!	false
diplomacy_strings_string_CHAOS_Sig_Dip_Greenskin_Rejection_Neutral_01	No, there is only one solution for a problem like yours, Orc – that’s to cleanse the world of your insufferable taint.	false
diplomacy_strings_string_CHAOS_Sig_Dip_Greenskin_Rejection_Neutral_02	By the Dark Prince, no! Absolutely not! I'd rather ally with those disgusting Dwarf creatures than Orcs!	false
diplomacy_strings_string_CHAOS_Sig_Dip_Greenskin_Rejection_Positive_01	Ugh, no… just no!	false
diplomacy_strings_string_CHAOS_Sig_Dip_Greenskin_Rejection_Positive_02	A novel suggestion… but I would rather pull out mine own eyes than have to look at you every day.	false
diplomacy_strings_string_CHAOS_Sig_Dip_Rejection_Negative_01	No, why would I ally with something so disgusting? I may be forced to kill you.	false
diplomacy_strings_string_CHAOS_Sig_Dip_Rejection_Negative_02	Fawners! Bring me Sliverslash – I am in a dark mood and need to bathe in the blood of this emissary.	false
diplomacy_strings_string_CHAOS_Sig_Dip_Rejection_Negative_03	Never, you are vile and I must purge the mortal plane of your unsightliness.	false
diplomacy_strings_string_CHAOS_Sig_Dip_Rejection_Neutral_01	Don't mistake me for a fool just because I mean to look good as I kill every last one of you.	false
diplomacy_strings_string_CHAOS_Sig_Dip_Rejection_Neutral_02	No, I don't need your help. After all, I am divine and you are not, mortal.	false
diplomacy_strings_string_CHAOS_Sig_Dip_Rejection_Neutral_03	Your offer insults me. Don't gawp – I'll cut you down before you can even fashion a response.	false
diplomacy_strings_string_CHAOS_Sig_Dip_Rejection_Positive_01	Oh, sorry, your armour has a sheen to it, and I caught my reflection in there… There is no deal – my hair is untidy!	false
diplomacy_strings_string_CHAOS_Sig_Dip_Rejection_Positive_02	No, I could never ally with such ugliness. The aesthetics are just too wrong.	false
diplomacy_strings_string_CHAOS_Sig_Dip_Rejection_Positive_03	No-no, this won't do. I need utter obsequence, you seem far too unruly for that.	false
diplomacy_strings_string_CHAOS_Sig_Dip_Vampire_Acceptance_Negative_01	Hmm, I do not like this, but my master instructs me so. It will be a joy to betray you at some point.	false
diplomacy_strings_string_CHAOS_Sig_Dip_Vampire_Acceptance_Negative_02	I cannot abide this situation, but I cannot ignore circumstances – pray, do not take advantage, creature.	false
diplomacy_strings_string_CHAOS_Sig_Dip_Vampire_Acceptance_Neutral_01	Agreed, but if you displease me, I'll show what preternatural speed truly is.	false
diplomacy_strings_string_CHAOS_Sig_Dip_Vampire_Acceptance_Neutral_02	Yes, an agreement is possible – but keep your rotten servants away from me.	false
diplomacy_strings_string_CHAOS_Sig_Dip_Vampire_Acceptance_Positive_01	Yes, Vampire and Chaos is an irresistible combination.	false
diplomacy_strings_string_CHAOS_Sig_Dip_Vampire_Acceptance_Positive_02	I'll accept, on the condition that you don't wear a red cape again – it really clashes with your deathly pallor.	false
diplomacy_strings_string_CHAOS_Sig_Dip_Vampire_Rejection_Negative_01	Mannfred goes too far – the Undead have no rights on what is already claimed by the Dark Prince!	false
diplomacy_strings_string_CHAOS_Sig_Dip_Vampire_Rejection_Negative_02	No, back to the graves with you, or I'll put you all back myself!	false
diplomacy_strings_string_CHAOS_Sig_Dip_Vampire_Rejection_Neutral_01	What a ridiculous notion - Undead, as an ally? I'd rather ask a favour from a Plaguebearer!	false
diplomacy_strings_string_CHAOS_Sig_Dip_Vampire_Rejection_Neutral_02	You test me, Vampire. Very unwise – it'll lead to your permanent death!	false
diplomacy_strings_string_CHAOS_Sig_Dip_Vampire_Rejection_Positive_01	No, I'm afraid the lack of mirrors around here really puts me off.	false
diplomacy_strings_string_CHAOS_Sig_Dip_Vampire_Rejection_Positive_02	How very droll, but I simply can't get over the stench around you and your… kin. So it's a no.	false
diplomacy_strings_string_CHAOS_SorceLord1_Dip_Acceptance_Negative_01	It is a deal I am not happy with, but the God of Magic demands it so. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_CHAOS_SorceLord1_Dip_Acceptance_Negative_02	Agreed, but keep a Collar of Khorne around your neck!	false
diplomacy_strings_string_CHAOS_SorceLord1_Dip_Acceptance_Negative_03	I have signed your fetid contract, but do not think you can entrap me within its words! 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_CHAOS_SorceLord1_Dip_Acceptance_Neutral_01	The Grand Manipulator has bought us together - it is best not to fight his will. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_CHAOS_SorceLord1_Dip_Acceptance_Neutral_02	Yes, the treaty is signed - ours is a force the world will fear!	false
diplomacy_strings_string_CHAOS_SorceLord1_Dip_Acceptance_Neutral_03	The covenant is agreed. Prepare your forces, mortal, as I will mine. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_CHAOS_SorceLord1_Dip_Acceptance_Positive_01	Yes, we have an agreement - one witnessed by the Dark Gods! 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_CHAOS_SorceLord1_Dip_Acceptance_Positive_02	There is deep power in what we make this day. I have foreseen it! 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_CHAOS_SorceLord1_Dip_Acceptance_Positive_03	Excellent, I'll send word to the Blue Scribes, so they may put it to record. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_CHAOS_SorceLord1_Dip_Bretonnia_Acceptance_Negative_01	I accept but only to see the carnage of Bretonnia's destruction up close.  	false
diplomacy_strings_string_CHAOS_SorceLord1_Dip_Bretonnia_Acceptance_Negative_02	So it will be. For agreeing this I do more to usher obliteration than refusing you, Bretonnian! 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_CHAOS_SorceLord1_Dip_Bretonnia_Acceptance_Neutral_01	I will agree - but the cost to you is great, Bretonnian. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_CHAOS_SorceLord1_Dip_Bretonnia_Acceptance_Neutral_02	Yes, and I will suck the lifeforce from every place you deem sacred in recompense! 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_CHAOS_SorceLord1_Dip_Bretonnia_Acceptance_Positive_01	Why not? There is much magic to drain from your lands. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_CHAOS_SorceLord1_Dip_Bretonnia_Acceptance_Positive_02	Good, we shall feast, but not on anything as mundane as food. No, power is my sustenance... 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_CHAOS_SorceLord1_Dip_Bretonnia_Rejection_Negative_01	I have no time for your stilted backwater realm. It will be consumed and dominated by Chaos! 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_CHAOS_SorceLord1_Dip_Bretonnia_Rejection_Negative_02	Never - your king will be my plaything, and I will break every last Knight that comes to challenge me! 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_CHAOS_SorceLord1_Dip_Bretonnia_Rejection_Neutral_01	No, mortals, you are insignificant. However, your lands hold some eldritch value - I will take them anyway. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_CHAOS_SorceLord1_Dip_Bretonnia_Rejection_Neutral_02	I care nothing for the fate of Bretonnia! Prepare your souls - for they are forfeit! 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_CHAOS_SorceLord1_Dip_Bretonnia_Rejection_Positive_01	What insipid folk you are - tell your king I am disappointed! 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_CHAOS_SorceLord1_Dip_Bretonnia_Rejection_Positive_02	No, not when I can mutate your horses from under you or melt your gleaming armour. I see no reason to treat with you. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_CHAOS_SorceLord1_Dip_Chaos_Acceptance_Negative_01	Yes - I dominate here! Witness my scintillating fires and bow before your new Lord. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_CHAOS_SorceLord1_Dip_Chaos_Acceptance_Negative_02	The bargain is struck, you will belong to me, there is no point fighting it, fool! 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_CHAOS_SorceLord1_Dip_Chaos_Acceptance_Neutral_01	Very well, we shall work as one. Yet do not forget whose master brought us together.	false
diplomacy_strings_string_CHAOS_SorceLord1_Dip_Chaos_Acceptance_Neutral_02	Yes, I'll will bring the raw might of Chaos magick, in return you must provide a Mutalith Vortex Beast!	false
diplomacy_strings_string_CHAOS_SorceLord1_Dip_Chaos_Acceptance_Positive_01	Yes! The quivering souls of the southerners just felt icy fingers upon them. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_CHAOS_SorceLord1_Dip_Chaos_Acceptance_Positive_02	The deal is struck - we will bring misery to hundreds of thousands!	false
diplomacy_strings_string_CHAOS_SorceLord1_Dip_Chaos_Rejection_Negative_01	Never - your brutal ways are the methods of a rabid dog who needs putting down! 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_CHAOS_SorceLord1_Dip_Chaos_Rejection_Negative_02	No, fool, I am the puppet master and you are the doll to be burnt in the fires of seven hells!  	false
diplomacy_strings_string_CHAOS_SorceLord1_Dip_Chaos_Rejection_Neutral_01	I refuse - you're horde does not suit my needs. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_CHAOS_SorceLord1_Dip_Chaos_Rejection_Neutral_02	No, creature, I have access to the fates. Your destiny is far too mundane. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_CHAOS_SorceLord1_Dip_Chaos_Rejection_Positive_01	Alas, no, I sense a great disturbance that would shatter any alliance. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_CHAOS_SorceLord1_Dip_Chaos_Rejection_Positive_02	No, mine is not to question why, but this treaty is forbidden by our masters. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_CHAOS_SorceLord1_Dip_Dwarf_Acceptance_Negative_01	Yes, but I'll have every tome of knowledge from your dusty shelves in payment! 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_CHAOS_SorceLord1_Dip_Dwarf_Acceptance_Negative_02	So be it, but don't think I'll spare you when the scourging of these Holds truly begins! 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_CHAOS_SorceLord1_Dip_Dwarf_Acceptance_Neutral_01	Good, Dwarf. It pleases me greatly to see how easily you bend to my will!	false
diplomacy_strings_string_CHAOS_SorceLord1_Dip_Dwarf_Acceptance_Neutral_02	I'll take your offer, Dwarf, knowing that you have cursed your family name for generations to come! 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_CHAOS_SorceLord1_Dip_Dwarf_Acceptance_Positive_01	Agreed. Your shame is your own to deal with, Dwarf, I care not! 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_CHAOS_SorceLord1_Dip_Dwarf_Acceptance_Positive_02	Ha - it is pleasing to see how you cast off your lauded honour to gain the benefits of my lore.	false
diplomacy_strings_string_CHAOS_SorceLord1_Dip_Dwarf_Rejection_Negative_01	No - Valaya was a withered hag whose prophecies couldn't even alter the fate of a door-slave.	false
diplomacy_strings_string_CHAOS_SorceLord1_Dip_Dwarf_Rejection_Negative_02	The Dwarfs are already dead. They are just too stubborn to accept it!	false
diplomacy_strings_string_CHAOS_SorceLord1_Dip_Dwarf_Rejection_Neutral_01	No! I don't need your permission to pick the secrets from Valaya's scorched bones!	false
diplomacy_strings_string_CHAOS_SorceLord1_Dip_Dwarf_Rejection_Neutral_02	The Grudgebearer and his kind are forsaken! What you claim to have I will take! 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_CHAOS_SorceLord1_Dip_Dwarf_Rejection_Positive_01	No - I have nothing against such stunted creatures - but the Changer of Fates has decreed their end. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_CHAOS_SorceLord1_Dip_Dwarf_Rejection_Positive_02	You must accept the inevitable, Dwarf - the Karaz Ankor is forsaken. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_CHAOS_SorceLord1_Dip_Empire_Acceptance_Negative_01	My services, yes, for the gifts of mutation, mutilation, putrefaction and the songs of a cacophonic choir. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_CHAOS_SorceLord1_Dip_Empire_Acceptance_Negative_02	We have a pact. Now you will see the true power of the Winds - your pitiful lores are nothing in comparison!	false
diplomacy_strings_string_CHAOS_SorceLord1_Dip_Empire_Acceptance_Neutral_01	The End Times come and nothing you do can change it - so there is little harm in an alliance... 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_CHAOS_SorceLord1_Dip_Empire_Acceptance_Neutral_02	Oh, this is good! Prostrate yourselves, yes. We have a pact, Empire fool! 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_CHAOS_SorceLord1_Dip_Empire_Acceptance_Positive_01	Good-good, now we can work in harmony for once. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_CHAOS_SorceLord1_Dip_Empire_Acceptance_Positive_02	At last you see the light, men of the Empire. Now all you need do is embrace change… 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_CHAOS_SorceLord1_Dip_Empire_Rejection_Negative_01	It is the eve of the End Times, Empire scum, there is nothing I cannot take from you. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_CHAOS_SorceLord1_Dip_Empire_Rejection_Negative_02	No - Franz will die choking on his own blood, I have foreseen it! 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_CHAOS_SorceLord1_Dip_Empire_Rejection_Neutral_01	I think not, I would not deign to any such deal with Sigmar's crippled offspring!	false
diplomacy_strings_string_CHAOS_SorceLord1_Dip_Empire_Rejection_Neutral_02	I bring change! Glorious, mutable change! There is no need for such strict pacts anymore. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_CHAOS_SorceLord1_Dip_Empire_Rejection_Positive_01	No, your nation is founded on lies - Sigmar Unberogen was nothing but a tribesman with a hammer!	false
diplomacy_strings_string_CHAOS_SorceLord1_Dip_Empire_Rejection_Positive_02	There is no deal, the Empire is doomed - Tzeentch has promised me so. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_CHAOS_SorceLord1_Dip_Greenskin_Acceptance_Negative_01	Yes, these limited creatures will have some use.	false
diplomacy_strings_string_CHAOS_SorceLord1_Dip_Greenskin_Acceptance_Negative_02	I have my doubts, Orc, but if you disappoint me, I can always twist off your head! 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_CHAOS_SorceLord1_Dip_Greenskin_Acceptance_Neutral_01	Very well, Orc. See it is done!	false
diplomacy_strings_string_CHAOS_SorceLord1_Dip_Greenskin_Acceptance_Neutral_02	The pact is sealed - dance or scream, as you see fit. The screams of other mortals will start soon enough! 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_CHAOS_SorceLord1_Dip_Greenskin_Acceptance_Positive_01	Agreed, Orc, but spare me your boasts or yelps of wonder, I have my own words to recite. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_CHAOS_SorceLord1_Dip_Greenskin_Acceptance_Positive_02	Very well, Greenskin, my arcane might be added to your brutish force. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_CHAOS_SorceLord1_Dip_Greenskin_Rejection_Negative_01	No, beast, there is no pact. Tzeentch places no value on your insignificant kind. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_CHAOS_SorceLord1_Dip_Greenskin_Rejection_Negative_02	There is no reality - no material plane - where you could be of use to me, Greenskin! 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_CHAOS_SorceLord1_Dip_Greenskin_Rejection_Neutral_01	I shan't waste my words on you, Orc - the answer is no!	false
diplomacy_strings_string_CHAOS_SorceLord1_Dip_Greenskin_Rejection_Neutral_02	There is no point, Orc - come the End Times you will be marked for slaughter along with all other things. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_CHAOS_SorceLord1_Dip_Greenskin_Rejection_Positive_01	A laughable notion! Be gone, before I turn you to spawn, Orc thing!	false
diplomacy_strings_string_CHAOS_SorceLord1_Dip_Greenskin_Rejection_Positive_02	No, I will not sully my master's vision by working with your ilk! 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_CHAOS_SorceLord1_Dip_Rejection_Negative_01	Now you'll incur my wrath, little mortal, and I do not forgive or forget! 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_CHAOS_SorceLord1_Dip_Rejection_Negative_02	Insufferable! I am surrounded by fools who dare to think they can hire me like some tradesman? 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_CHAOS_SorceLord1_Dip_Rejection_Negative_03	My services are not for you, worm - they are to rid this plane of your ilk!	false
diplomacy_strings_string_CHAOS_SorceLord1_Dip_Rejection_Neutral_01	I have no time for you - this coven will not be! 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_CHAOS_SorceLord1_Dip_Rejection_Neutral_02	No, your desires are of little consequence to me. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_CHAOS_SorceLord1_Dip_Rejection_Neutral_03	How could such a deal be brokered? You have nothing I want, mortal! 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_CHAOS_SorceLord1_Dip_Rejection_Positive_01	I saw that you would come, but the fates have only just cleared and I must reject your advance. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_CHAOS_SorceLord1_Dip_Rejection_Positive_02	You proffer tempting considerations… but the time is not now. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_CHAOS_SorceLord1_Dip_Rejection_Positive_03	No, I have not the wherewithal to share power with you. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_CHAOS_SorceLord1_Dip_Vampire_Acceptance_Negative_01	Yes-yes, bring forth the bands of enslavement! I will have you as my own, Vampire!	false
diplomacy_strings_string_CHAOS_SorceLord1_Dip_Vampire_Acceptance_Negative_02	A blood pact is made and bound with impossible magicks, to break them is to forfeit whatever passes for your soul, creature! 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_CHAOS_SorceLord1_Dip_Vampire_Acceptance_Neutral_01	Yes, there is a twisted logic in working together that will please the Dark Gods.	false
diplomacy_strings_string_CHAOS_SorceLord1_Dip_Vampire_Acceptance_Neutral_02	Agreed, we are both puppet masters, although my strings are longer. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_CHAOS_SorceLord1_Dip_Vampire_Acceptance_Positive_01	Very well, our dread forces shall unite! 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_CHAOS_SorceLord1_Dip_Vampire_Acceptance_Positive_02	I have conversed with a Lord of Change - he thinks it wise to accept. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_CHAOS_SorceLord1_Dip_Vampire_Rejection_Negative_01	No, Vampire - take your weak minions and flee my wrath, it will not be to your aristocratic tastes. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_CHAOS_SorceLord1_Dip_Vampire_Rejection_Negative_02	You are a still-born abomination, nothing more than a marionette on a string I can cut. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_CHAOS_SorceLord1_Dip_Vampire_Rejection_Neutral_01	No, Vampire - your kind have had their chance, now you must reap what you sow along with all the rest. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_CHAOS_SorceLord1_Dip_Vampire_Rejection_Neutral_02	You are naught but an empty vessel - the Chaos Gods have no use for flasks and beakers. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_CHAOS_SorceLord1_Dip_Vampire_Rejection_Positive_01	How vexing, but I must decline - Chaos is the only power. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_CHAOS_SorceLord1_Dip_Vampire_Rejection_Positive_02	Your offer is pitiful - come back to me when you realise my true potential. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_CTH_Dip_Accept_State_Gift_01	On behalf of the Celestial Emperor, thank you.	false
diplomacy_strings_string_CTH_Dip_Accept_State_Gift_02	May you forever know harmony.	false
diplomacy_strings_string_CTH_Dip_Accept_State_Gift_03	Your respect is noted.	false
diplomacy_strings_string_CTH_Dip_Acknowledge_Accept_01	Then we are in harmony.	false
diplomacy_strings_string_CTH_Dip_Acknowledge_Accept_02	The Winds have guided you well.	false
diplomacy_strings_string_CTH_Dip_Acknowledge_Accept_03	It is an honour.	false
diplomacy_strings_string_CTH_Dip_Acknowledge_Cancel_Treaty_01	Only a fool would slight the Celestial Dragon!	false
diplomacy_strings_string_CTH_Dip_Acknowledge_Cancel_Treaty_02	You know not what you do.	false
diplomacy_strings_string_CTH_Dip_Acknowledge_Cancel_Treaty_03	Why would you incite the wrath of Dragons?	false
diplomacy_strings_string_CTH_Dip_Acknowledge_Reject_01	Your crude offence will be remembered.	false
diplomacy_strings_string_CTH_Dip_Acknowledge_Reject_02	Xen Yang is watching. He notes this snub.	false
diplomacy_strings_string_CTH_Dip_Acknowledge_Reject_03	You are witless indeed to reject Grand Cathay.	false
diplomacy_strings_string_CTH_Dip_Acknowledge_War_01	So be it. The Celestial Empire shall prevail as always.	false
diplomacy_strings_string_CTH_Dip_Acknowledge_War_02	We have no fear, for the Emperor watches over us.	false
diplomacy_strings_string_CTH_Dip_Acknowledge_War_03	Those who pursue disharmony pay a heavy price.	false
diplomacy_strings_string_CTH_Dip_Cancel_Treaty_01	The Celestial Empire has no need of desperate wretches.	false
diplomacy_strings_string_CTH_Dip_Cancel_Treaty_02	You have served your purpose. The Emperor needs you no longer.	false
diplomacy_strings_string_CTH_Dip_Cancel_Treaty_03	This contract brings only disharmony.	false
diplomacy_strings_string_CTH_Dip_Demand_Join_War_01	Stand with Cathay! Shine Celestial light upon our foes!	false
diplomacy_strings_string_CTH_Dip_Demand_Join_War_02	The Dragon Emperor calls upon you! 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_CTH_Dip_Demand_Join_War_03	Aid our glorious cause! Restore harmony!	false
diplomacy_strings_string_CTH_Dip_Demand_Payments_Negative_01	The debt must be paid. Harmony must be restored. Do not dare refuse.	false
diplomacy_strings_string_CTH_Dip_Demand_Payments_Neutral_01	It is time to repay Xen Yang's kindness.	false
diplomacy_strings_string_CTH_Dip_Demand_Payments_Positive_01	Alas, even the Celestial treasury is not bottomless.	false
diplomacy_strings_string_CTH_Dip_Demand_Region_01	For you to live, the Celestial Empire must grow.	false
diplomacy_strings_string_CTH_Dip_Demand_Region_02	We can seize your lands by force, or you can choose a simpler path.	false
diplomacy_strings_string_CTH_Dip_Demand_Region_03	Surrender this realm and you may know harmony once more.	false
diplomacy_strings_string_CTH_Dip_Generic_Offer_Cathay_Negative_01	Our Emperor speaks through me. You know the price of refusing him.	false
diplomacy_strings_string_CTH_Dip_Generic_Offer_Cathay_Negative_02	Heed me well, turncoat, or you will suffer Xen Yang's immortal wrath.	false
diplomacy_strings_string_CTH_Dip_Generic_Offer_Cathay_Neutral_01	Think upon this, for my cause is our beloved Emperor's cause.	false
diplomacy_strings_string_CTH_Dip_Generic_Offer_Cathay_Neutral_02	For the good of all Cathay, hear me now!	false
diplomacy_strings_string_CTH_Dip_Generic_Offer_Cathay_Positive_01	Emperor's blessings upon you. What say you to this?	false
diplomacy_strings_string_CTH_Dip_Generic_Offer_Cathay_Positive_02	May we one before Xen Yang. There is much to discuss.	false
diplomacy_strings_string_CTH_Dip_Generic_Offer_Daemon_Negative_01	Heed this well, Daemon, or be immolated by the Emperor's light!	false
diplomacy_strings_string_CTH_Dip_Generic_Offer_Daemon_Negative_02	You can listen, or you can join the countless others of your kind slain by Cathay.	false
diplomacy_strings_string_CTH_Dip_Generic_Offer_Daemon_Neutral_01	Hear the voice of harmony, Daemon!	false
diplomacy_strings_string_CTH_Dip_Generic_Offer_Daemon_Neutral_02	The Great Enemy would be wise to listen.	false
diplomacy_strings_string_CTH_Dip_Generic_Offer_Daemon_Positive_01	Of all your hell-sent kind, you alone will understand.	false
diplomacy_strings_string_CTH_Dip_Generic_Offer_Daemon_Positive_02	I trust our Great Enemy is in a receptive mood?	false
diplomacy_strings_string_CTH_Dip_Generic_Offer_Khorne_Negative_01	Hear Xen Yang's decree or be obliterated, fiend!	false
diplomacy_strings_string_CTH_Dip_Generic_Offer_Khorne_Negative_02	You who are disharmony incarnate must accede, or destruction follows.	false
diplomacy_strings_string_CTH_Dip_Generic_Offer_Khorne_Neutral_01	Will you hear the Dragon's word, Daemon?	false
diplomacy_strings_string_CTH_Dip_Generic_Offer_Khorne_Neutral_02	There need be no slaughter, merely discussion.	false
diplomacy_strings_string_CTH_Dip_Generic_Offer_Khorne_Positive_01	Think upon this, Daemon. It may benefit us both.	false
diplomacy_strings_string_CTH_Dip_Generic_Offer_Khorne_Positive_02	May the eight Winds blow in your favour, fiend. What say you to this?	false
diplomacy_strings_string_CTH_Dip_Generic_Offer_Kislev_Negative_01	Heed Cathay's decree, little empire of the ice, or your story ends.	false
diplomacy_strings_string_CTH_Dip_Generic_Offer_Kislev_Negative_02	Obey the Dragon, or Kislev will become but a whisper upon the snow.	false
diplomacy_strings_string_CTH_Dip_Generic_Offer_Kislev_Neutral_01	Humans and Dragons are often in accord. Let this be one of those times.	false
diplomacy_strings_string_CTH_Dip_Generic_Offer_Kislev_Neutral_02	I bring the Emperor's word to the children of Ursun.	false
diplomacy_strings_string_CTH_Dip_Generic_Offer_Kislev_Positive_01	May the Motherland know only harmony. Now, what say you?	false
diplomacy_strings_string_CTH_Dip_Generic_Offer_Kislev_Positive_02	The Emperor sends warm blessings to cold Kislev, and this decree.	false
diplomacy_strings_string_CTH_Dip_Generic_Offer_Negative_01	Heed this well, for none can survive the Dragon Emperor's wrath!	false
diplomacy_strings_string_CTH_Dip_Generic_Offer_Negative_02	Ignore us and know disharmony eternal.	false
diplomacy_strings_string_CTH_Dip_Generic_Offer_Negative_03	History is littered with the corpses of those who refused Cathay.	false
diplomacy_strings_string_CTH_Dip_Generic_Offer_Negative_04	This is Xen Yang's decree! Hearken to it, or know obliteration!	false
diplomacy_strings_string_CTH_Dip_Generic_Offer_Negative_05	The Emperor will not be ignored. I suggest you do not test this.	false
diplomacy_strings_string_CTH_Dip_Generic_Offer_Neutral_01	The Emperor's wisdom is infinite. Heed His words well.	false
diplomacy_strings_string_CTH_Dip_Generic_Offer_Neutral_02	This is the Celestial Dragon's decree. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_CTH_Dip_Generic_Offer_Neutral_03	I speak for all Cathay. We are not accustomed to being refused.	false

diplomacy_strings_string_Chaos_Arc_Dip_Chaos_Arc_Greet_Neu_02	I am the Everchosen, bend the knee or I will take your heart and slaughter your entire retinue. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_Chaos_Arc_Dip_Chaos_Greet_Neg_01	What do you want, putrid cretin? Don't mistake this parley for anything else - the Gods favour me!	false

diplomacy_strings_string_Chaos_Arc_Dip_Emp_Greet_Neu_01	Is this what the Empire sends to parley? The leavings from its little zoo? Return them as Spawn! 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_Chaos_Arc_Dip_Emp_Greet_Neu_02	Sigmar's Empire interests me less and less. It is the whole world I demand, not his pathetic corner. 	false

diplomacy_strings_string_Chaos_Arc_Dip_Vamp_Greet_Neg_01	You title yourself Count or Lord but it doesn't make you one, grave-feeder. I am the undisputed Lord of the End Times! 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_Chaos_Arc_Dip_Vamp_Greet_Neg_02	You are irrelevant, Vampire! Nothing but a withered soul clinging to mortal remains. I will dominate you!	false
diplomacy_strings_string_Chaos_Arc_Dip_Vamp_Greet_Neul_01	The arrogance of the Undead astounds me! You are hollow, and therefore have no value to me. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_Chaos_Arc_Dip_Vamp_Greet_Neul_02	What do you want, grave-feeder, have you run out of tombs to lurk in? 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_Chaos_Arc_Dip_Vamp_Greet_Pos_01	Vampires! Grave-scum, I have little interest in your petty power games, what is it you want?  	false

diplomacy_strings_string_Chaos_Lord1_Dip_Bret_Greet_Neg_01	Yours lands, your forest, your castles… all with be ash. So issue your message, it is meaningless. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_Chaos_Lord1_Dip_Bret_Greet_Neg_02	I despise those who believe in some lake-hag! I don't need to hear your herald. Your time is over! 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_Chaos_Lord1_Dip_Bret_Greet_Neu_01	What does the Bretonnian king want with a Lord of Chaos? Does he beg for his pitiful life? 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_Chaos_Lord1_Dip_Bret_Greet_Neu_02	I'll hear your words, mannish creature. If the message displease me, I'll strangle you with your own tongue. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_Chaos_Lord1_Dip_Bret_Greet_Pos_01	Bretonnian - how is your pathetic little nation? 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_Chaos_Lord1_Dip_Bret_Greet_Pos_02	That's right, Knight, say your prayers, I hope that wench you worship can hear you, she is doomed too. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_Chaos_Lord1_Dip_Chaos_Greet_Neg_01	You think you'll reach Daemonhood before me? Best pray to our masters that apotheosis happens soon… 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_Chaos_Lord1_Dip_Chaos_Greet_Neg_02	Make your offer, and I'll have you bound to it - within a runic shard if I have to! 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_Chaos_Lord1_Dip_Chaos_Greet_Neu_01	What do you want? Do not expect me to bow, I only bend the knee to the Dark Gods, not their pretenders.	false
diplomacy_strings_string_Chaos_Lord1_Dip_Chaos_Greet_Neu_02	What does my fellow Lord desire, I wonder? Does the Changer bring you here, or the God of Murder… 	false

diplomacy_strings_string_Chaos_Lord1_Dip_Dwf_Greet_Neg_01	Dwarfs! What a putrid race! Your Empire withers, your mountains crumble, what could you offer me?	false
diplomacy_strings_string_Chaos_Lord1_Dip_Dwf_Greet_Neg_02	Bearded wretches – that is what I see before me! Get on your pinguid bellies, Dwarf, and plead!	false
diplomacy_strings_string_Chaos_Lord1_Dip_Dwf_Greet_Neu_01	Dwarf-scum! I knew you would come crawling upon your fat bellies, dragging your beards in filth.	false
diplomacy_strings_string_Chaos_Lord1_Dip_Dwf_Greet_Neu_02	Sons of Grungni – when did you get so weak, so pathetic?	false
diplomacy_strings_string_Chaos_Lord1_Dip_Dwf_Greet_Pos_01	Does the Karaz Ankor struggle so badly that Dwarfs must come begging for leniency? 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_Chaos_Lord1_Dip_Dwf_Greet_Pos_02	Dwarfs, know that your crumbling empire holds no interest, that alone, may glean you a tiny advantage. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_Chaos_Lord1_Dip_Emp_Greet_Neg_01	At last we come to the Empire - poxes, pain, mutation and murder will be my legacy! 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_Chaos_Lord1_Dip_Emp_Greet_Neg_02	Tremble, Empire-man - what the Black-Iron Reaver did to Volganof is nothing compared to my plans. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_Chaos_Lord1_Dip_Emp_Greet_Neu_01	The Sons of Sigmar Unberogen - you have fallen so far since your first Emperor has been lost… 	false

diplomacy_strings_string_Chaos_Lord2_Dip_Bret_Greet_Neg_01	Yours lands, your forest, your castles… all with be ash. So issue your message, it is meaningless. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_Chaos_Lord2_Dip_Bret_Greet_Neg_02	I despise those who believe in some lake-hag! I don't need to hear your herald. Your time is over! 	false

diplomacy_strings_string_Chaos_Lord2_Dip_Dwf_Greet_Neg_01	Dwarfs! What a putrid race! Your Empire withers, your mountains crumble, what could you offer me?	false

diplomacy_strings_string_Chaos_Sig_Dip_Greet_Neu_01	Yes, you may look upon my beatific features and marvel – many do. When you have finished, pray, tell me your wants?	false

diplomacy_strings_string_Chaos_Sig_Dip_Greet_Neu_03	Well, introduce yourself, obsequious creatures, I already bore of this ruse.	false
diplomacy_strings_string_Chaos_Sig_Dip_Greet_Pos_01	Well this is simply marvellous! More playthings to talk to! Tell me your desires.	false
diplomacy_strings_string_Chaos_Sig_Dip_Greet_Pos_02	My true father instructs me to talk to you. It seems we may have common cause.	false
diplomacy_strings_string_Chaos_Sig_Dip_Greet_Pos_03	Yes, I am handsome, but we must forgo the usual flattery - a deal needs to be struck.	false
diplomacy_strings_string_Chaos_Sig_Dip_Grnskn_Greet_Neg_01	What have you to say, vile beast? Speak fast I can already feel my gorge rising!	false
diplomacy_strings_string_Chaos_Sig_Dip_Grnskn_Greet_Neg_02	Greenskins! No wonder I despise that colour, such a noxious tone…	false

diplomacy_strings_string_Chaos_Sig_Dip_Grnskn_Greet_Neu_02	Orcs dare to stand before me! It makes me nauseous. Hand me my sword so I may resolve this!	false
diplomacy_strings_string_Chaos_Sig_Dip_Grnskn_Greet_Pos_01	What a foul beast! Although, being in your presence reinforces mine own beauty, so speak on, Orc!	false
diplomacy_strings_string_Chaos_Sig_Dip_Grnskn_Greet_Pos_02	Orc, you sully my mood just looking at you, best speak your message quickly.	false
diplomacy_strings_string_Chaos_Sig_Dip_Vamp_Greet_Neg_01	If I must talk to the Undead, let them do it in bright sunlight, so they may take in my comeliness!	false

diplomacy_strings_string_Chaos_Sig_Dip_Vamp_Greet_Neu_01	What is your message, Liche? I have little time for such ugly things.	false
diplomacy_strings_string_Chaos_Sig_Dip_Vamp_Greet_Neu_02	I've no interest in the Undead, my master wishes to claim more vigorous souls – so speak quickly.	false
diplomacy_strings_string_Chaos_Sig_Dip_Vamp_Greet_Pos_01	Ahh, Vampires, we share some of the same tastes – I'm sure I could also carry off the 'faded grandeur' look.	false
diplomacy_strings_string_Chaos_Sig_Dip_Vamp_Greet_Pos_02	Such gloomy surroundings, no wonder you grave-feeders are always in such a sour mood.	false
diplomacy_strings_string_Chaos_SorceLord1_Dip_Bret_Greet_Neg_01	What could you tempt me with? Bretonnian, your fey weak, water sprite doesn’t scare me. 	false

diplomacy_strings_string_Chaos_SorceLord1_Dip_Chaos_Greet_Neg_01	You mistake me for servant, when I am master, fool! Pay your tribute and be done! 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_Chaos_SorceLord1_Dip_Chaos_Greet_Neg_02	What do the emaciated northern tribes want? They wish to leech at me, like some withered lamprey no doubt!  	false
diplomacy_strings_string_Chaos_SorceLord1_Dip_Chaos_Greet_Neu_01	You seek parley… tell me have you read from the Liber Malefic? There are chapters within that tell of this meeting... 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_Chaos_SorceLord1_Dip_Chaos_Greet_Neu_02	Ahh, the subtle threats - I'm quite partial to those myself, for I am in favour with the Great Deceiver. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_Chaos_SorceLord1_Dip_Chaos_Greet_Pos_01	Greetings friend, the Changer orders us to make peace, to fight common foes, who are we to go against His will? 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_Chaos_SorceLord1_Dip_Chaos_Greet_Pos_02	There is much power to be had, many souls to reap - perhaps we could do it together?	false
diplomacy_strings_string_Chaos_SorceLord1_Dip_Dwf_Greet_Neg_01	Here come the stunted mewlers – so full of self-importance, yet nothing but Slaughterbrute fodder to me! 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_Chaos_SorceLord1_Dip_Dwf_Greet_Neg_02	Thorgrim is nothing but a cripple in a stone chair still he sends his wittering, decrepit ancients to treat with me? 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_Chaos_SorceLord1_Dip_Dwf_Greet_Neu_01	I'll hear you, Dwarf, but then you must hear my truths – that your kingdom shall be despoiled. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_Chaos_SorceLord1_Dip_Dwf_Greet_Neu_02	What does the Dwarf thing want? I won't speak to it directly it is – quite literally – below me. 	false

diplomacy_strings_string_Chaos_SorceLord1_Dip_Emp_Greet_Neu_02	Why do the rabble listen to you? Because the office of Emperor means you hold a golden mallet? Let me show you true power, mortals! 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_Chaos_SorceLord1_Dip_Emp_Greet_Pos_01	Lords of the Empire, I bring a promise… your lives and those of your people will be saved, if we strike a deal. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_Chaos_SorceLord1_Dip_Emp_Greet_Pos_02	Does the Emperor not see the trouble he sows? If only you'd come to a compact - send me souls and so much ruckus could be avoided. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_Chaos_SorceLord1_Dip_Greet_Neg_01	You dare to summon the arcane might of a sorcerous Lord of Chaos? 	false

diplomacy_strings_string_Chaos_SorceLord1_Dip_Greet_Neu_01	You stand before a sorcerer blessed by Tzeentch himself… make your case. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_Chaos_SorceLord1_Dip_Greet_Neu_02	Untold power; if that's what you were promised, I can certainly provide it - but there is a cost! 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_Chaos_SorceLord1_Dip_Greet_Neu_03	There is no better spell-crafter than me! But I do not give my services willingly, I have requirements. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_Chaos_SorceLord1_Dip_Greet_Pos_01	Hmm… What do the Winds of Magic blow to my portal? 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_Chaos_SorceLord1_Dip_Greet_Pos_02	There is a deal to be struck, but first I must know your real name - your true name - yes? 	false

diplomacy_strings_string_DLC09_TMB_Dip_Generic_Offer_Empire_Negative_02	The words of a king should carry weight, even in this forsaken land! Silence, I am talking!	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DLC09_TMB_Dip_Generic_Offer_Empire_Neutral_01	Do try to curb your barbaric tendencies while I am speaking.	false

diplomacy_strings_string_DLC09_TMB_Dip_Generic_Offer_Greenskin_Negative_02	Quiet! The noise you creatures make is unbearable! I can feel it rattling round my skull!	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DLC09_TMB_Dip_Generic_Offer_Greenskin_Neutral_01	The way of knowledge is narrow, perhaps too narrow for a Greenskin…	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DLC09_TMB_Dip_Generic_Offer_Greenskin_Neutral_02	A wise King knows that even a blunt instrument has its uses from time to time.	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DLC09_TMB_Dip_Generic_Offer_Greenskin_Positive_01	The fine art of diplomacy is clearly wasted on you, so I shall simply get to the point.	false

diplomacy_strings_string_DLC09_TMB_Dip_Generic_Offer_Negative_03	I would sooner bathe in a sea of khepra beetles than converse with you, yet here I am!	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DLC09_TMB_Dip_Generic_Offer_Neutral_01	It is customary to kneel before a king. Especially one bearing generous offers.	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DLC09_TMB_Dip_Generic_Offer_Neutral_02	I have much to tell you, listen carefully.	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DLC09_TMB_Dip_Generic_Offer_Neutral_03	A wise man is silent before his betters. 	false

diplomacy_strings_string_DLC09_TMB_Dip_Generic_Offer_Vampire_Neutral_02	May the light of the gods cleanse your tortured soul, Vampire. I have a proposition for you.	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DLC09_TMB_Dip_Generic_Offer_Vampire_Positive_01	Your silvered tongue may fool mortals, but I am as old as the sands of my homeland and with age, comes wisdom.	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DLC09_TMB_Dip_Generic_Offer_Vampire_Positive_02	Do not attempt to beguile me, Vampire, you will fail! Just listen.	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DLC09_TMB_Dip_Generic_Offer_Woodelves_Negative_01	You will hear what I have to say! Fail to do so and you may find your homeland rather… changed.	false

diplomacy_strings_string_DLC09_TMB_Dip_Greet_neg_gen_09	Like Ptra, I am divine – worship me and we may strike a pact.	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DLC09_TMB_Dip_Greet_neg_gen_10	Usirian warns against a pact with you, so speak now.	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DLC09_TMB_Dip_Greet_neg_hef_01	I have little time for such fey, living things. Approach if you must.	false

diplomacy_strings_string_DLC11_CST_Cylostra_Direfin_dip_neg_lzd_04	A pointless audience. Why should I sing for a race that merely hisses?	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DLC11_CST_Cylostra_Direfin_dip_neg_skv_01	There is a need for pest control I see.	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DLC11_CST_Cylostra_Direfin_dip_neg_skv_02	What value does a songstress such as I have in dealing with a rat? 	false

diplomacy_strings_string_DLC11_CST_Cylostra_Direfin_dip_neu_gen_09	What souls will you give? For the rest of you to live?	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DLC11_CST_Cylostra_Direfin_dip_neu_gen_10	I have performed to royalty, sung for the greatest kings… why must I entertain you?	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DLC11_CST_Cylostra_Direfin_dip_neu_hef_01	You are not the Phoenix King! I shall only sing for the Elf sovereign and that tune will signal his drowning!	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DLC11_CST_Cylostra_Direfin_dip_neu_hef_02	At last, a truly appreciative crowd. I will sing for you, Elf, and you will be amazed. 	false

diplomacy_strings_string_DLC11_CST_Cylostra_Direfin_dip_neu_tmb_01	Such ugly things. May I bring beauty to your existence with my voice?	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DLC11_CST_Cylostra_Direfin_dip_neu_tmb_02	Do you appreciate art? Can your bandaged ears hear me sing? If so, we may talk.	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DLC11_CST_Cylostra_Direfin_dip_neu_vmp_01	I've encountered your kind before, Vampire. Will you also be a patron of the arts?	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DLC11_CST_Cylostra_Direfin_dip_neu_vmp_02	The next performance is due, Vampire. I expect a rapturous applause. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DLC11_CST_Dip_Accept_State_Gift_01	The galleon always has space for more booty!	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DLC11_CST_Dip_Accept_State_Gift_02	Free wealth is always welcome, though the crew may have preferred to plunder for it!	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DLC11_CST_Dip_Accept_State_Gift_03	Don’t expect such generosity to be reciprocated.	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DLC11_CST_Dip_Acceptance_DarkElves_Negative_01	You have my agreement… but if this is a trick, Druchii scum, it will not end well for you.	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DLC11_CST_Dip_Acceptance_DarkElves_Negative_02	A typically hollow offer from your treacherous kind, but one I cannot decline.	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DLC11_CST_Dip_Acceptance_DarkElves_Neutral_01	The Dark Ones drive a hard bargain, but we have a deal.	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DLC11_CST_Dip_Acceptance_DarkElves_Neutral_02	Dealings with Naggaroth rarely end well, but let us see where this takes us.	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DLC11_CST_Dip_Acceptance_DarkElves_Positive_01	From one sea-reaver to another, I accept.	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DLC11_CST_Dip_Acceptance_DarkElves_Positive_02	Perhaps it is your Dark Arts at work here, but we have reached an accord.	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DLC11_CST_Dip_Acceptance_Highelves_Negative_01	I would sooner see those long limbs of yours torn from your body... but you have my acceptance.	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DLC11_CST_Dip_Acceptance_Highelves_Negative_02	I accept the Asur’s pathetic terms. Now be gone, before you are made to walk the plank!	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DLC11_CST_Dip_Acceptance_Highelves_Neutral_01	The sea can often be fickle with what it provides us, Elf, so I must accept.	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DLC11_CST_Dip_Acceptance_Highelves_Neutral_02	As long as 'the greater good' you claim to work towards also benefits me, we can do business.	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DLC11_CST_Dip_Acceptance_Highelves_Positive_01	The time of the Asur may have passed, but I can see the advantage in agreement.	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DLC11_CST_Dip_Acceptance_Highelves_Positive_02	I would usually not care about such things, but you have me convinced today.	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DLC11_CST_Dip_Acceptance_Lizardmen_Negative_01	I agree, but your slithering, scaly kind will soon lament this day!	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DLC11_CST_Dip_Acceptance_Lizardmen_Negative_02	I will exercise restraint and accept, instead of spilling your cold blood.	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DLC11_CST_Dip_Acceptance_Lizardmen_Neutral_01	I’ll accept, if only to get your foul kind out of my sight.	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DLC11_CST_Dip_Acceptance_Lizardmen_Neutral_02	I am unsure about you estranged reptiles... but your offer is acceptable.	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DLC11_CST_Dip_Acceptance_Lizardmen_Positive_01	You jungle-dwellers rarely offer such intriguing options. I accept.	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DLC11_CST_Dip_Acceptance_Lizardmen_Positive_02	Your ends are a mystery, Lizardman, but I feel there is advantage in this agreement.	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DLC11_CST_Dip_Acceptance_Negative_01	You may have your way this day, but this acceptance does not rule out your future death!	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DLC11_CST_Dip_Acceptance_Negative_02	I had planned on killing you today, but circumstances dictate that I must accept. Next time, perhaps…	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DLC11_CST_Dip_Acceptance_Negative_03	You are fortunate, there are just enough reasons for me to accept this offer instead of killing you.	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DLC11_CST_Dip_Acceptance_Neutral_01	The deal is done, but know that I would sooner cut you than be double-crossed.	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DLC11_CST_Dip_Acceptance_Neutral_02	I know not what you are plotting, but I will play along for now.	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DLC11_CST_Dip_Acceptance_Neutral_03	Such a satisfactory offer will be regarded with suspicion… but is accepted.	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DLC11_CST_Dip_Acceptance_Positive_01	We accept. We may be brigands, but we do not stab our business partners – not in the back, at least.	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DLC11_CST_Dip_Acceptance_Positive_02	Good! If it pleases you, help yourself to my admirals' supplies of rum on your way out.	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DLC11_CST_Dip_Acceptance_Positive_03	Only a fool would turn this down.	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DLC11_CST_Dip_Acceptance_Skaven_Negative_01	As with most vermin, I’d usually not waste my time on you, but on this occasion I must agree.	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DLC11_CST_Dip_Acceptance_Skaven_Negative_02	I have no choice – typical of you stinking Skaven to manipulate circumstances to your own ends!	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DLC11_CST_Dip_Acceptance_Skaven_Neutral_01	The rodent’s proposal cannot be overlooked.	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DLC11_CST_Dip_Acceptance_Skaven_Neutral_02	I’m not a gambler, but I will take any advantage presented to me, even if it did come from a rat!	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DLC11_CST_Dip_Acceptance_Skaven_Positive_01	No mere scavengers, are you? Enough bargaining – I accept.	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DLC11_CST_Dip_Acceptance_Skaven_Positive_02	A compelling offer – your scurrying rat-claws have certainly done the legwork.	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DLC11_CST_Dip_Acceptance_TombKings_Negative_01	We will do this your way, but let it be known – you and your Undead minions will soon serve me!	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DLC11_CST_Dip_Acceptance_TombKings_Negative_02	This deal will only delay your inevitable destruction, sand-zombie! The Tomb Kings are not imperishable!	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DLC11_CST_Dip_Acceptance_TombKings_Neutral_01	I did not think the desert could offer anything useful to me, but I was clearly mistaken.	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DLC11_CST_Dip_Acceptance_TombKings_Neutral_02	I care not for the schemes of long-dead priests, but I can do business with them.	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DLC11_CST_Dip_Acceptance_TombKings_Positive_01	The Undying kind certainly know a good deal - I would know.	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DLC11_CST_Dip_Acceptance_TombKings_Positive_02	We have a deal, Nehekharan.	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DLC11_CST_Dip_Acceptance_VampCoast_Negative_01	May your ships be scuppered for forcing me into this position!	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DLC11_CST_Dip_Acceptance_VampCoast_Negative_02	Have your way this time, pretender, but the ocean will never be big enough for the two of us!	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DLC11_CST_Dip_Acceptance_VampCoast_Neutral_01	A deal made without spilt blood is proof that sometimes there *is* honour amongst thieves.	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DLC11_CST_Dip_Acceptance_VampCoast_Neutral_02	A tactful offer. I am accustomed to profiting from more incompetent pirates.	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DLC11_CST_Dip_Acceptance_VampCoast_Positive_01	The sea fosters understanding!	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DLC11_CST_Dip_Acceptance_VampCoast_Positive_02	It is fortunate that we see eye to eye, for piracy is a cutthroat business.	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DLC11_CST_Dip_Acceptance_Vampire_Negative_01	Sylvanian treachery never ceases to amaze! You leave me no choice!	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DLC11_CST_Dip_Acceptance_Vampire_Negative_02	Have your terms, you pathetic excuse for a creature of the night!	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DLC11_CST_Dip_Acceptance_Vampire_Neutral_01	I know the Vampires of the land love to squabble, but you have no disagreement with me.	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DLC11_CST_Dip_Acceptance_Vampire_Neutral_02	Though I care very little for your petty affairs, I am not averse to doing things your way.	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DLC11_CST_Dip_Acceptance_Vampire_Positive_01	Of course, it is more favourable to do business with ones closer to my kind.	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DLC11_CST_Dip_Acceptance_Vampire_Positive_02	It is easier to come to terms with those who see things from a similar perspective.	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DLC11_CST_Dip_Acknowledge_Accept_01	Good! It seems you are not as stupid as you appear.	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DLC11_CST_Dip_Acknowledge_Accept_02	A wise choice. If you’d declined, I’d have to kill you.	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DLC11_CST_Dip_Acknowledge_Accept_03	Whichever god it is you pray to has guided you well!	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DLC11_CST_Dip_Acknowledge_Cancel_Treaty_01	Very well, but death always comes sooner to those who betray the sea's children.	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DLC11_CST_Dip_Acknowledge_Cancel_Treaty_02	We had an understanding! This will not end well!	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DLC11_CST_Dip_Acknowledge_Cancel_Treaty_03	You will pay for this. Mark my words!	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DLC11_CST_Dip_Acknowledge_Reject_01	Take heed, for you will live to regret this… or die for it.	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DLC11_CST_Dip_Acknowledge_Reject_02	You must have a good reason to turn this down. Is it stupidity?	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DLC11_CST_Dip_Acknowledge_Reject_03	The arrogance! Be grateful that these terms were not offered at the edge of a cutlass!	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DLC11_CST_Dip_Acknowledge_War_01	Finally! The deckhands thirst for murder and plunder!	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DLC11_CST_Dip_Acknowledge_War_02	There shall be all the more slaves for my ranks!	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DLC11_CST_Dip_Acknowledge_War_03	I will enjoy destroying you and your weak followers!	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DLC11_CST_Dip_Cancel_Treaty_01	The treaty is off. We do not need your favour!	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DLC11_CST_Dip_Cancel_Treaty_02	Did you actually think a pact with a pirate would last?	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DLC11_CST_Dip_Cancel_Treaty_03	Friendship is a landlubber’s concept!	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DLC11_CST_Dip_Demand_Join_War_01	Your money or your life!	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DLC11_CST_Dip_Demand_Join_War_02	A little gold goes a long way.	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DLC11_CST_Dip_Demand_Join_War_03	You’d do well to stay on my good side. The sea can be a perilous place.	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DLC11_CST_Dip_Demand_Payments_Negative_01	Sail with us to blood-soaked glory!	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DLC11_CST_Dip_Demand_Payments_Neutral_01	The wind fills our sails and blows us towards war! Let’s crush these wretches!	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DLC11_CST_Dip_Demand_Payments_Positive_01	Your murderous ranks would be useful to us in the coming fight.	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DLC11_CST_Dip_Generic_Offer_Darkelves_Negative_01	I’m not averse to feeding you to the Prometheans, Druchii! Alas, I come for business, not pleasure.	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DLC11_CST_Dip_Generic_Offer_Darkelves_Negative_02	I’d sooner obliterate every one of your pathetic Black Arks, Elf-dog! But today I shall throw you a bone.	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DLC11_CST_Dip_Generic_Offer_Darkelves_Neutral_01	Consider these demands, and you might even end up with something to take back to your bleak shores.	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DLC11_CST_Dip_Generic_Offer_Darkelves_Neutral_02	Do the deluded Dark Ones know a good deal when they see one?	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DLC11_CST_Dip_Generic_Offer_Darkelves_Positive_01	Many see us both as pirates, Naggarothi, but that should not prevent us from profiteering together.	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DLC11_CST_Dip_Generic_Offer_Darkelves_Positive_02	We both know how to reap the profits of the sea, so you will surely see the benefit in this deal. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DLC11_CST_Dip_Generic_Offer_Highelves_Negative_01	Elves do love the sound of their own voices, don’t they? Now shut up and listen!	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DLC11_CST_Dip_Generic_Offer_Highelves_Negative_02	Although I’m here to negotiate, we both know I’d rather be burning Ulthuan’s cities to the ground!	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DLC11_CST_Dip_Generic_Offer_Highelves_Neutral_01	Contain your ego for just a moment, Asur, and hear these terms.	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DLC11_CST_Dip_Generic_Offer_Highelves_Neutral_02	Though are vocations differ, that is no reason not to do business…	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DLC11_CST_Dip_Generic_Offer_Highelves_Positive_01	Surely there are some things that even the affluent Elves would want?	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DLC11_CST_Dip_Generic_Offer_Highelves_Positive_02	I have something that might interest you. I’m sure the Phoenix King would agree.	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DLC11_CST_Dip_Generic_Offer_Lizardmen_Negative_01	Cease your unintelligible reptilian babble for just one moment and listen!	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DLC11_CST_Dip_Generic_Offer_Lizardmen_Negative_02	Though I would rather see those flapping, forked tongues cut out of your misshapen heads, there are matters to discuss.	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DLC11_CST_Dip_Generic_Offer_Lizardmen_Neutral_01	I care little for your incomprehensible motives, but we must talk.	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DLC11_CST_Dip_Generic_Offer_Lizardmen_Neutral_02	Compose yourselves, Lizardmen. I come to offer a deal, not a fight.	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DLC11_CST_Dip_Generic_Offer_Lizardmen_Positive_01	Is there time in your strange schemes for a little business with us?	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DLC11_CST_Dip_Generic_Offer_Lizardmen_Positive_02	I know the children of the Old Ones are no fools, so I trust we can see eye to eye.	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DLC11_CST_Dip_Generic_Offer_Negative_01	Hold your tongue and listen, or I'll feed it to one of the Scurvy Dogs!	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DLC11_CST_Dip_Generic_Offer_Negative_02	These are our terms. Accept them and you might get out of this alive.	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DLC11_CST_Dip_Generic_Offer_Negative_03	Be warned, rejection of our terms is often followed by a brisk walk off the plank!	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DLC11_CST_Dip_Generic_Offer_Neutral_01	I’ve sailed far to get here, so listen carefully.	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DLC11_CST_Dip_Generic_Offer_Neutral_02	I bring terms. What say you?	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DLC11_CST_Dip_Generic_Offer_Neutral_03	Do we have a deal? I haven’t got all day!	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DLC11_CST_Dip_Generic_Offer_Positive_01	There is a way to further both our causes.	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DLC11_CST_Dip_Generic_Offer_Positive_02	There’s no reason why we can’t both have our way, would you not say?	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DLC11_CST_Dip_Generic_Offer_Positive_03	I assure you, we can both gain an advantage from this…	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DLC11_CST_Dip_Generic_Offer_Skaven_Negative_01	Any day I am forced to do business with a rat is to be lamented!	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DLC11_CST_Dip_Generic_Offer_Skaven_Negative_02	Even you virulent, flea-ridden, wretches must see the benefit in this.	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DLC11_CST_Dip_Generic_Offer_Skaven_Neutral_01	I’m told that the giant rodents have a bit of business acumen, and are not just brainless parasites…	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DLC11_CST_Dip_Generic_Offer_Skaven_Neutral_02	Take it or leave it. I do not want to spend a second longer than necessary in your pestilential presence.	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DLC11_CST_Dip_Generic_Offer_Skaven_Positive_01	There is a greater scheme at work here, and I know the Skaven like a good scheme…	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DLC11_CST_Dip_Generic_Offer_Skaven_Positive_02	We are both unwholesome creatures, so I think we can find a way to benefit one another.	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DLC11_CST_Dip_Generic_Offer_TombKings_Negative_01	I’d happily test how imperishable you really are, but there are more important matters at hand.	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DLC11_CST_Dip_Generic_Offer_TombKings_Negative_02	Though I despise the Tomb Kings, one can’t always choose their business partners.	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DLC11_CST_Dip_Generic_Offer_TombKings_Neutral_01	Come now, what kind of a 'king' would turn down such an offer?	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DLC11_CST_Dip_Generic_Offer_TombKings_Neutral_02	To say your time has passed would be an understatement, Nehekharan, yet this may still interest you.	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DLC11_CST_Dip_Generic_Offer_TombKings_Positive_01	You are as old as the sands of your homelands, Priest King, but has time has granted you wisdom?	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DLC11_CST_Dip_Generic_Offer_TombKings_Positive_02	The Unliving do their best business with the Unliving, I'm sure you'll agree.	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DLC11_CST_Dip_Generic_Offer_VampCoast_Negative_01	I would send your minions back down to their watery graves if I did not have to offer you this!	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DLC11_CST_Dip_Generic_Offer_VampCoast_Negative_02	The ocean only sustains you because I allow it to! Now hear these terms!	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DLC11_CST_Dip_Generic_Offer_VampCoast_Neutral_01	Put away your cutlasses and listen. I wouldn’t want to have to kill you prematurely.	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DLC11_CST_Dip_Generic_Offer_VampCoast_Neutral_02	I do not usually tolerate those who challenge my rule over the waves, but I am willing to make a business exception.	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DLC11_CST_Dip_Generic_Offer_VampCoast_Positive_01	A pirate knows what a pirate wants.	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DLC11_CST_Dip_Generic_Offer_VampCoast_Positive_02	We both know the ocean is unforgiving, but perhaps we can help one another?	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DLC11_CST_Dip_Generic_Offer_Vampire_Negative_01	Hear my terms, or I will force you to walk the plank in the midday sun!	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DLC11_CST_Dip_Generic_Offer_Vampire_Negative_02	If I did not have this deal to put to you, I would show you the true extent of my power!	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DLC11_CST_Dip_Generic_Offer_Vampire_Neutral_01	Keep your cheap conjurings to yourself, Sylvanian. I bring a proposition, not a fight.	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DLC11_CST_Dip_Generic_Offer_Vampire_Neutral_02	Halt your petty preoccupations for just a second, and listen.	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DLC11_CST_Dip_Generic_Offer_Vampire_Positive_01	You may not be sailors, but you are Vampires, so I think we can see eye to eye.	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DLC11_CST_Dip_Generic_Offer_Vampire_Positive_02	The landlubbers of Sylvania are not above a deal, are they?	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DLC11_CST_Dip_Offer_Cooperation_01	The ocean could be a much less perilous for you, if you would only consider this pact.	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DLC11_CST_Dip_Offer_Cooperation_02	You could do no wrong by being on our good side.	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DLC11_CST_Dip_Offer_Cooperation_03	Only an unwise leader would not see the sense in accepting these terms.	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DLC11_CST_Dip_Offer_Cooperation_DarkElves_01	There is much to gain for you here, Druchii, but do not bite off more than you can chew.	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DLC11_CST_Dip_Offer_Cooperation_DarkElves_02	The Dark Ones aren’t so foolish to turn down a pact with us, I hope.	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DLC11_CST_Dip_Offer_Cooperation_Highelves_01	You High Elves love to talk, but if you care for your kind, you would do well to listen.	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DLC11_CST_Dip_Offer_Cooperation_Highelves_02	You’ll be glad to know that I am not here to wage war, Elf.	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DLC11_CST_Dip_Offer_Cooperation_Lizardmen_01	A treaty with us is worth its weight in Slann Gold!	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DLC11_CST_Dip_Offer_Cooperation_Lizardmen_02	This will surely please your inscrutable gods.	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DLC11_CST_Dip_Offer_Cooperation_Skaven_01	Twitchy you may be, rodent, but even you must understand the value of a treaty.	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DLC11_CST_Dip_Offer_Cooperation_Skaven_02	You may see this as gaining an advantage, but it is no more than circumstances force me to offer.	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DLC11_CST_Dip_Offer_Cooperation_TombKings_01	The passage of time might not affect the either of us, Nehekharan, but I haven’t got forever to wait for an answer.	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DLC11_CST_Dip_Offer_Cooperation_TombKings_02	Has your immortality given you the wisdom to make the right choice here?	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DLC11_CST_Dip_Offer_Cooperation_VampCoast_01	It’s not in my nature to offer a treaty to a freebooting rival, but ends justify these means.	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DLC11_CST_Dip_Offer_Cooperation_VampCoast_02	An agreement between us has the potential to be as destructive as an ocean tempest.	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DLC11_CST_Dip_Offer_Cooperation_Vampire_01	I know the pettiness of Vampires, but I also know you are smart enough to see the sense in a treaty.	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DLC11_CST_Dip_Offer_Cooperation_Vampire_02	A treaty between the forces of Undeath will instil fear in the living!	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DLC11_CST_Dip_Offer_Gift_01	Though we are not typically ones to share, the ship’s hold bursts with loot.	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DLC11_CST_Dip_Offer_Gift_02	Let us share the successes of our despoilments.	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DLC11_CST_Dip_Offer_Gift_03	A gift of booty!	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DLC11_CST_Dip_Offer_Join_War_01	Our pistols and broadsides are ready. We only need someone to kill!	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DLC11_CST_Dip_Offer_Join_War_02	The deckhands are eager to fight, and your enemies will make good cannon-fodder.	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DLC11_CST_Dip_Offer_Join_War_03	I love the smell of black powder in the morning!	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DLC11_CST_Dip_Offer_Peace_01	The admirals grow weary of this conflict.	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DLC11_CST_Dip_Offer_Peace_02	We tire of picking on lesser foes, so are willing to broker a peace.	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DLC11_CST_Dip_Offer_Peace_03	We’ve had our fill of booty from you! There are other shores to pillage…	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DLC11_CST_Dip_Offer_Peace_Darkelves_01	You offer us nothing, Naggarothi – we even tire of killing you.	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DLC11_CST_Dip_Offer_Peace_Darkelves_02	The Dark Ones may never know peace, but your futures will be bleaker if you do not accept this.	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DLC11_CST_Dip_Offer_Peace_Highelves_01	Lucky for you, we’ve decided our attentions are better directed towards others.	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DLC11_CST_Dip_Offer_Peace_Highelves_02	I assume Ulthuan would prefer to exist in peace?	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DLC11_CST_Dip_Offer_Peace_Lizardmen_01	We have decided that you and your fetid homelands are no longer of interest to us.	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DLC11_CST_Dip_Offer_Peace_Lizardmen_02	The sea offers us other opportunities – we have little time for this war.	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DLC11_CST_Dip_Offer_Peace_Skaven_01	I’m not averse to exterminating vermin, but this fight has run its course.	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DLC11_CST_Dip_Offer_Peace_Skaven_02	Even when you drown, you infect the waters around you! Enough of this conflict!	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DLC11_CST_Dip_Offer_Peace_TombKings_01	Since many of us are immortal, it may be best to end this conflict, lest it never ends at all…	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DLC11_CST_Dip_Offer_Peace_TombKings_02	A good king, living or dead, does what is best for his followers, tomb-dweller.	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DLC11_CST_Dip_Offer_Peace_VampCoast_01	Just because we are both despoilers of the sea does not mean we must be enemies. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DLC11_CST_Dip_Offer_Peace_VampCoast_02	The sea craves to be still once more, at least for the time being.	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DLC11_CST_Dip_Offer_Peace_Vampire_01	This war is a waste of our Undead minions.	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DLC11_CST_Dip_Offer_Peace_Vampire_02	I am familiar enough with the Sylvanian Vampires to know they prefer peace to subservience.	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DLC11_CST_Dip_Reject_Join_Confederation_01	This is laughable! We answer to no-one, least of all you!	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DLC11_CST_Dip_Reject_Join_Confederation_02	Our pistols, cutlasses, and broadsides are for our purposes, and no-one else’s!	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DLC11_CST_Dip_Reject_Join_Confederation_03	I can see why you would want our help, but we are not in the business of fighting for others.	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DLC11_CST_Dip_Reject_Peace_01	I enjoy the overwhelming stench of your fear far too much to consider a peace.	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DLC11_CST_Dip_Reject_Peace_02	I would not want to disappoint the fleet with a cease-fire, there are still many of you to kill!	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DLC11_CST_Dip_Reject_Peace_03	No! This will not end until your rotting corpses are fish food!	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DLC11_CST_Dip_Reject_Peace_Darkelves_01	I did not know the Naggarothi were quitters. This war will not end that easily!	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DLC11_CST_Dip_Reject_Peace_Darkelves_02	Your words of peace are as futile as your pathetic Dark Arts!	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DLC11_CST_Dip_Reject_Peace_Highelves_01	You can’t talk yourself out of war with us, Elf, no matter how good with words you are!	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DLC11_CST_Dip_Reject_Peace_Highelves_02	Never! Ulthuan’s beaches shall be drenched red with your blood!	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DLC11_CST_Dip_Reject_Peace_Lizardmen_01	We will burn your jungle realms to the ground! There will be no escape!	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DLC11_CST_Dip_Reject_Peace_Lizardmen_02	Beg for mercy, lizard. Though your forked tongues offer peace, I see it for the pathetic grovelling that it is!	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DLC11_CST_Dip_Reject_Peace_Skaven_01	The desperation of the Skaven shows their weakness. This war shall continue until their destruction!	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DLC11_CST_Dip_Reject_Peace_Skaven_02	Peace with us is a fruitless endeavour, rat!	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DLC11_CST_Dip_Reject_Peace_TombKings_01	You cannot rid yourself of our ire that easily, Nehekharan!	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DLC11_CST_Dip_Reject_Peace_TombKings_02	Whether at sea or in your forsaken desert realm, there is nowhere you are safe from us! 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DLC11_CST_Dip_Reject_Peace_VampCoast_01	There can be no peace between us until your fleets lie wrecked on the ocean floor!	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DLC11_CST_Dip_Reject_Peace_VampCoast_02	Your waters are our waters! Do not attempt to claim legitimacy, you cannot escape your destruction!	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DLC11_CST_Dip_Reject_Peace_Vampire_01	You will not be spared... Sylvania will fall!	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DLC11_CST_Dip_Reject_Peace_Vampire_02	We shall not relent until the pathetic Vampires of the land are no more!	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DLC11_CST_Dip_Rejection_Darkelves_Negative_01	Take your pathetic offer back to your frozen hovels!	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DLC11_CST_Dip_Rejection_Darkelves_Negative_02	Not even your Dark Arts could convince me that this paltry offer is worthwhile!	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DLC11_CST_Dip_Rejection_Darkelves_Neutral_01	The Witch King can do better than that!	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DLC11_CST_Dip_Rejection_Darkelves_Neutral_02	Maybe if you threw in one of those Black Arks of yours?	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DLC11_CST_Dip_Rejection_Darkelves_Positive_01	Your silver tongue may be able to convince me of much, Naggarothi, but not this.	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DLC11_CST_Dip_Rejection_Darkelves_Positive_02	While I distrust your kind least of all the Elven races, I cannot accept this offer.	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DLC11_CST_Dip_Rejection_Highelves_Negative_01	I have no time for you scheming Elves, your offers only serve your meddlesome ways!	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DLC11_CST_Dip_Rejection_Highelves_Negative_02	The Phoenix King must think me an idiot!	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DLC11_CST_Dip_Rejection_Highelves_Neutral_01	No deal, Elf. My fleet will profit little from this.	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DLC11_CST_Dip_Rejection_Highelves_Neutral_02	Even the most skilled orators of Ulthuan could not convince me to accept this.	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DLC11_CST_Dip_Rejection_Highelves_Positive_01	With all your eloquence, it is a pity your offer really does not interest me.	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DLC11_CST_Dip_Rejection_Highelves_Positive_02	We may be on good terms with the Asur, but I would be a fool to accept.	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DLC11_CST_Dip_Rejection_Lizardmen_Negative_01	The denizens of the sea do not mix with lizard-freaks!	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DLC11_CST_Dip_Rejection_Lizardmen_Negative_02	This offer is as much a joke as those useless pyramids of yours!	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DLC11_CST_Dip_Rejection_Lizardmen_Neutral_01	Whatever your mysterious ends, I care not for them.	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DLC11_CST_Dip_Rejection_Lizardmen_Neutral_02	Come now, I know Lustria has better things to offer.	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DLC11_CST_Dip_Rejection_Lizardmen_Positive_01	I cannot agree to your terms today, Lizardman.	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DLC11_CST_Dip_Rejection_Lizardmen_Positive_02	The will of your strange gods will not be carried out today.	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DLC11_CST_Dip_Rejection_Negative_01	Until the sea swallows you whole and never spits you out, never!	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DLC11_CST_Dip_Rejection_Negative_02	You’ll walk the plank for this insult!	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DLC11_CST_Dip_Rejection_Negative_03	You call this an offer? Get out of my sight, before I feed you to the Scurvy Dogs!	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DLC11_CST_Dip_Rejection_Neutral_01	We have no need for your business.	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DLC11_CST_Dip_Rejection_Neutral_02	You may be brave for coming here, but you are also witless for thinking I would accept your offer.	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DLC11_CST_Dip_Rejection_Neutral_03	A nice thought, but the barnacles on my galleon are worth more than this.	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DLC11_CST_Dip_Rejection_Positive_01	An interesting proposal, but I cannot accept.	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DLC11_CST_Dip_Rejection_Positive_02	A better offer might be worth negotiating, but not this.	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DLC11_CST_Dip_Rejection_Positive_03	I can tolerate your company, yes, but I can’t agree to your terms.	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DLC11_CST_Dip_Rejection_Skaven_Negative_01	The only thing that’s going to happen here is the Scurvy Dogs getting the taste for rat-meat!	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DLC11_CST_Dip_Rejection_Skaven_Negative_02	I’d sooner see you all drown, as is befitting of all pestilent rodents!	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DLC11_CST_Dip_Rejection_Skaven_Neutral_01	We shall not be tricked into dealings with the Skaven!	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DLC11_CST_Dip_Rejection_Skaven_Neutral_02	Your barely coherent chittering has only confirmed that this was a waste of my time.	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DLC11_CST_Dip_Rejection_Skaven_Positive_01	Tempting as this offer may be, I am wary of deals with the Skaven.	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DLC11_CST_Dip_Rejection_Skaven_Positive_02	It is just too difficult to trust the word of a rat.	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DLC11_CST_Dip_Rejection_TombKings_Negative_01	It would bring me much greater joy to put you deluded Undead 'kings' out of your misery!	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DLC11_CST_Dip_Rejection_TombKings_Negative_02	I will only consider terms that involve your annihilation, Nehekharan!	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DLC11_CST_Dip_Rejection_TombKings_Neutral_01	I do not accept this offer, nor your legitimacy as king.	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DLC11_CST_Dip_Rejection_TombKings_Neutral_02	It is laughable that you think I would accept an offer from a walking relic.	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DLC11_CST_Dip_Rejection_TombKings_Positive_01	Though I admire that little Undead empire of yours, I cannot accept.	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DLC11_CST_Dip_Rejection_TombKings_Positive_02	There’s just not enough in this for me, Tomb King.	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DLC11_CST_Dip_Rejection_VampCoast_Negative_01	I would sooner destroy you and the putrid souls that serve you on your wretched fleets!	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DLC11_CST_Dip_Rejection_VampCoast_Negative_02	A pathetic excuse for a fleet, and a pathetic excuse for an offer to boot!	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DLC11_CST_Dip_Rejection_VampCoast_Neutral_01	You must have had a little too much rum if you think I’d accept this.	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DLC11_CST_Dip_Rejection_VampCoast_Neutral_02	The ocean realms have witnessed few more audacious offers than this!	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DLC11_CST_Dip_Rejection_VampCoast_Positive_01	As much as I like to do a deal with a fellow denizen of the sea, I cannot accept.	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DLC11_CST_Dip_Rejection_VampCoast_Positive_02	We have sufficient booty, and have no need for anything more.	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DLC11_CST_Dip_Rejection_Vampire_Negative_01	I would rather give my Vampire Admirals the pleasure of purging their weak Sylvanian cousins!	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DLC11_CST_Dip_Rejection_Vampire_Negative_02	The days of the land Vampires are numbered, there is no use in trying to bargain your way out!	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DLC11_CST_Dip_Rejection_Vampire_Neutral_01	You Sylvanians reek of desperation and fear, as does this pitiful offer!	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DLC11_CST_Dip_Rejection_Vampire_Neutral_02	The selfish and conniving von Carsteins will not get their way.	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DLC11_CST_Dip_Rejection_Vampire_Positive_01	What a pity, I thought Sylvania could offer me more.	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DLC11_CST_Dip_Rejection_Vampire_Positive_02	I can just about tolerate you landlubbing Vampires, but this is not a deal I can accept.	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DLC11_CST_Dip_War_01	Our broadsides have you in their sights and they bring your destruction!	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DLC11_CST_Dip_War_02	My Undead crew shall revel in burning your hovels to the ground! Your souls are booty!	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DLC11_CST_Dip_War_03	We shall bring a tide of death from the sea to sweep over your entire race!	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DLC11_CST_Dip_War_Darkelves_01	Your Black Arks have meddled in our dominion for the last time!	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DLC11_CST_Dip_War_Darkelves_02	Dark Magic cannot overcome the power of black powder, Naggarothi!	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DLC11_CST_Dip_War_Highelves_01	Ulthuan’s shores shall be stained red with High Elf blood!	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DLC11_CST_Dip_War_Highelves_02	Our cutlasses and guns shall be idle no more, Asur!	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DLC11_CST_Dip_War_Lizardmen_01	War is upon you, Lizardman!	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DLC11_CST_Dip_War_Lizardmen_02	My fleets shall bring death and despoilment to your entire race, puny reptile!	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DLC11_CST_Dip_War_Skaven_01	I look forward to hearing the anguished screeching of you and your burning brethren, ratman!	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DLC11_CST_Dip_War_Skaven_02	Time to exterminate your verminous race once and for all!	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DLC11_CST_Dip_War_TombKings_01	I shall pulverise your ancient civilisation back into the sands once and for all, desert-dog!	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DLC11_CST_Dip_War_TombKings_02	A war of the Unliving it is, then!	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DLC11_CST_Dip_War_VampCoast_01	Ready your scurvy crews, for they’ll soon either be dead or dead and serving me!	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DLC11_CST_Dip_War_VampCoast_02	As it is on land, it is at sea – the weak succumb to the poor, and succumb you will!	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DLC11_CST_Dip_War_Vampire_01	I’ve always wanted to end Sylvania’s hegemony over the creatures of the night, and so it shall be!	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DLC11_CST_Dip_War_Vampire_02	The old order of Vampire Counts has had its day, I shall see to that!	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DLC11_CST_Luthor_Harkon_dip_neg_cst_01	Better captains than you have met their end trying to best me!	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DLC11_CST_Luthor_Harkon_dip_neg_cst_02	Have you come to grovel before your Pirate King?	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DLC11_CST_Luthor_Harkon_dip_neg_cst_03	All the sea is mine! All of it!	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DLC11_CST_Luthor_Harkon_dip_neg_def_01	You think yourself sadists, but I can show you true pain, Naggarothi!	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DLC11_CST_Luthor_Harkon_dip_neg_def_02	My cutlass has felled many Dark Elves, and can easily kill one more.	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DLC11_CST_Luthor_Harkon_dip_neg_gen_01	One part of me wants to hear you speak, another wants to kill you.	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DLC11_CST_Luthor_Harkon_dip_neg_gen_02	I might kill you, but worry not - an empty vessel still has a purpose!	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DLC11_CST_Luthor_Harkon_dip_neg_gen_03	The Winds may shun me, but I am still a master at inflicting pain.	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DLC11_CST_Luthor_Harkon_dip_neg_gen_04	More cattle for the slaughter!	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DLC11_CST_Luthor_Harkon_dip_neg_gen_05	Your timing could not be better! The Scurvy Dogs are due a feed.	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DLC11_CST_Luthor_Harkon_dip_neg_gen_06	You must be eager to become fish food.	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DLC11_CST_Luthor_Harkon_dip_neg_gen_07	Watch your words, they will likely be your last.	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DLC11_CST_Luthor_Harkon_dip_neg_gen_08	I’m happy to fulfil your death wish. Is that not why you have come?	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DLC11_CST_Luthor_Harkon_dip_neg_gen_09	The Pirate King is no pawn! I will end you!	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DLC11_CST_Luthor_Harkon_dip_neg_gen_10	You are a problem. I solve problems by killing them.	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DLC11_CST_Luthor_Harkon_dip_neg_hef_01	Let’s see if the Asur can dodge bullets!	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DLC11_CST_Luthor_Harkon_dip_neg_hef_02	Your time has long passed, you white-garbed fools! Bow to me now!	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DLC11_CST_Luthor_Harkon_dip_neg_lzd_01	Your Lustrian strongholds shall never be safe until I find what I seek!	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DLC11_CST_Luthor_Harkon_dip_neg_lzd_02	I will beat the secrets of the Slann out of you if I must!	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DLC11_CST_Luthor_Harkon_dip_neg_skv_01	Stinking rats! Nothing but plague-blooded vermin!	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DLC11_CST_Luthor_Harkon_dip_neg_skv_02	Filth always comes to the surface.	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DLC11_CST_Luthor_Harkon_dip_neg_tmb_01	I will put you right back in the sand, Nehekharan!	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DLC11_CST_Luthor_Harkon_dip_neg_tmb_02	The only Unliving king round here is me, dune-dweller!	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DLC11_CST_Luthor_Harkon_dip_neg_vmp_01	Cheap conjurings are no match for black powder, Vampire lord!	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DLC11_CST_Luthor_Harkon_dip_neg_vmp_02	There is no more pathetic a Vampire than a Sylvanian.	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DLC11_CST_Luthor_Harkon_dip_neu_cst_01	Tread carefully, sailor – we both know there is little honour between pirates.	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DLC11_CST_Luthor_Harkon_dip_neu_cst_02	What pact do you offer, fellow admiral of the night?	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DLC11_CST_Luthor_Harkon_dip_neu_cst_03	You are a long way from your waters, freebooter.	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DLC11_CST_Luthor_Harkon_dip_neu_def_01	Do you come to trade the plunder of your Corsairs, Druchii?	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DLC11_CST_Luthor_Harkon_dip_neu_def_02	Those Black Arks of yours are quite the galleons.	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DLC11_CST_Luthor_Harkon_dip_neu_gen_01	Don't waste my time, or I shall have you walk the plank!	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DLC11_CST_Luthor_Harkon_dip_neu_gen_02	I'm not sure if I want to cut a deal with you… or just cut you.	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DLC11_CST_Luthor_Harkon_dip_neu_gen_03	I've decided not to kill you, but my minds can be fickle…	false

diplomacy_strings_string_DLC11_CST_Luthor_Harkon_dip_neu_gen_05	I cannot guarantee your safety. Especially from me…	false

diplomacy_strings_string_DLC11_DEF_Lokhir_Fellheart_dip_neu_gen_10	Amuse the Krakenlord of Karond Kar… or suffer my displeasure.	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DLC11_DEF_Lokhir_Fellheart_dip_neu_hef_01	You are prey, Asur. Should the eagle listen to the mouse's plea?	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DLC11_DEF_Lokhir_Fellheart_dip_neu_hef_02	Oh, Asur child, the fun I can have with you and yours.	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DLC11_DEF_Lokhir_Fellheart_dip_neu_hef_03	Why should I talk to you, traitor, when I can enslave you?	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DLC11_DEF_Lokhir_Fellheart_dip_neu_hef_04	Prostrate yourself all you want, Ulthuan's coasts are mine to scour.	false

diplomacy_strings_string_DLC11_DEF_Lokhir_Fellheart_dip_neu_lzd_02	I have slain many of your kind, ancient one. Do you offer me more?	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DLC11_DEF_Lokhir_Fellheart_dip_neu_lzd_03	Lizardmen is what mankind calls you. How like them to name you after themselves.	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DLC11_DEF_Lokhir_Fellheart_dip_neu_lzd_04	You send an envoy to my vessel, but for what purpose? In the hope I will cease despoiling your temple-cities?	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DLC11_DEF_Lokhir_Fellheart_dip_neu_skv_01	Why should the Kraken speak to the rodent?	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DLC11_DEF_Lokhir_Fellheart_dip_neu_skv_02	Vermin? On my deck? This isn't a sinking ship!	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DLC11_DEF_Lokhir_Fellheart_dip_neu_tmb_01	Come, bone-clanker, creature of Nethu, what do you propose?	false

diplomacy_strings_string_DWF_Dip_Accept_State_Gift_01	Ahh, Gorl! I like its shine. Many thanks. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DWF_Dip_Accept_State_Gift_02	If you think to bribe us with valuables, it won't work. These are gifts and will be treated as such – with our gratitude – but that is where the matter ends. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DWF_Dip_Accept_State_Gift_03	We have many words for gold, for nothing gleams like it. This will be placed in the vaults with our thanks! 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DWF_Dip_Acknowledge_Accept_01	Good, we shall strike out a grudge in the Dammaz Kron in acknowledgement. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DWF_Dip_Acknowledge_Accept_02	A wise move from a race so prone to blunders… 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DWF_Dip_Acknowledge_Accept_03	Very well, there may be hope for you yet. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DWF_Dip_Acknowledge_Cancel_Treaty_01	I might have known, oathbreakers! 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DWF_Dip_Acknowledge_Cancel_Treaty_02	An oath means nothing to you! We'll have our vengeance! 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DWF_Dip_Acknowledge_Cancel_Treaty_03	Into the Great Book of Grudges you go, treaty-breakers! 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DWF_Dip_Acknowledge_Reject_01	Careful now, that was an honourable offer. You do not want to offend the Dawi.	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DWF_Dip_Acknowledge_Reject_02	Reject us!? Just what kind of unbaraki scum are you? 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DWF_Dip_Acknowledge_Reject_03	I'd have taken the offer and been grateful to boot, but I expected nothing less. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DWF_Dip_Acknowledge_War_01	By Grimnir's Axe, you'll rue the day for this outrage! 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DWF_Dip_Acknowledge_War_02	War it is! Be careful what you wish for, urk! 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DWF_Dip_Acknowledge_War_03	You are due a reckoning. Soon, it will come.	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DWF_Dip_Cancel_Treaty_01	As you have broken many clauses in said treaty, it is void – our honour remains intact. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DWF_Dip_Cancel_Treaty_02	The Reckoners have studied the treaty, and found it wanting. Consider it cancelled. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DWF_Dip_Cancel_Treaty_03	There is no treaty, no union between us! This was a mistake that might see me take the Slayer Oath yet. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DWF_Dip_Demand_Join_War_01	Take up your az and join us, surely your honour demands it?	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DWF_Dip_Demand_Join_War_02	Do not sully your ancestors with cowardice, the time for war is now!	false

diplomacy_strings_string_DWF_Dip_Demand_Payments_Positive_01	I present a bill, it will need paying – not a coin more or less. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DWF_Dip_Generic_Offer_Bretonnia_Negative_01	I have no time for your fripperies, umgi – this is our demand. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DWF_Dip_Generic_Offer_Bretonnia_Negative_02	You have tested our patience long enough, if you wish to tread near the Grey Mountains again you'll hear us out. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DWF_Dip_Generic_Offer_Bretonnia_Neutral_01	Let Valaya and the Lady talk through us, manling, and know that profit for both can follow. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DWF_Dip_Generic_Offer_Bretonnia_Neutral_02	Maybe there is time for one last alliance between men and Dawi? 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DWF_Dip_Generic_Offer_Bretonnia_Positive_01	We both worship great rinn gods of beauty worthy of our ancestors; there is much to bind us, umgi. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DWF_Dip_Generic_Offer_Bretonnia_Positive_02	We'll drink your grape-water, manling, but insist that you take a pint of Grimbold's Firecracker as well. Then we can talk about other dull things...	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DWF_Dip_Generic_Offer_Chaos_Negative_01	Hear us, Chaos grobitz – our demands are simple! 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DWF_Dip_Generic_Offer_Chaos_Negative_02	The Karaz Ankor is far from done yet, Chaos scum – hear us! 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DWF_Dip_Generic_Offer_Chaos_Neutral_01	It leaves a bitter taste upon my tongue and a stink in my whiskers, but I must make a request. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DWF_Dip_Generic_Offer_Chaos_Neutral_02	Even you must break from killing, Northmen. When you do, we have an offer. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DWF_Dip_Generic_Offer_Chaos_Positive_01	Will the Chaos-kin, not listen? Doesn't your vile God trade in promises and pacts? 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DWF_Dip_Generic_Offer_Chaos_Positive_02	We may have to take your tainted gorl, and hope that Valaya is not listening when such a promise is made. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DWF_Dip_Generic_Offer_Dwarf_Negative_01	Are you from Karak Zorn? Do you not speak Khazalid? We demand an audience! 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DWF_Dip_Generic_Offer_Dwarf_Negative_02	You shame us all with your actions. In the name of the High King, hear us! 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DWF_Dip_Generic_Offer_Dwarf_Neutral_01	We must unite as the Karaz Ankor of old – so receive our offer. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DWF_Dip_Generic_Offer_Dwarf_Neutral_02	Do we not all ask for Grimnir's strength when we wield our axes? Then let us talk. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DWF_Dip_Generic_Offer_Dwarf_Positive_01	Fellow Dawi, let us share a tankard of Bugman's and put the world to rights! 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DWF_Dip_Generic_Offer_Dwarf_Positive_02	Eventually, all must bow before the Throne of Power. Why not do so now? 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DWF_Dip_Generic_Offer_Empire_Negative_01	You have disappointed us, and to think you share the same blood of Sigmar – now there was a manling we could trust! 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DWF_Dip_Generic_Offer_Empire_Negative_02	No, umgi, you will listen to us! 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DWF_Dip_Generic_Offer_Empire_Neutral_01	Perhaps the men of the Empire are ready to talk with their old allies? 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DWF_Dip_Generic_Offer_Empire_Neutral_02	Will the men of Sigmar be great again? Will they hear us out?	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DWF_Dip_Generic_Offer_Empire_Positive_01	Come, men, let us drink your watery brews and talk of offers and trade. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DWF_Dip_Generic_Offer_Empire_Positive_02	We are impressed by the Emperor, he recalls in us the great Lords of your race. The End Times approach, now is the time for the alliances of old to be renewed. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DWF_Dip_Generic_Offer_Greenskin_Negative_01	Listen, grobi filth, before I take your ears myself! 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DWF_Dip_Generic_Offer_Greenskin_Negative_02	I demand your Warboss hears us now or we will wipe your stinking tribe from above and below! 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DWF_Dip_Generic_Offer_Greenskin_Neutral_01	We have demands, Greenskin. Ones you would be wise to act upon! 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DWF_Dip_Generic_Offer_Greenskin_Neutral_02	By Grungni's anvil, I despise what I must do here – yet we have an offer to make. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DWF_Dip_Generic_Offer_Greenskin_Positive_01	Come Orc, maybe there is a profit in these talks… 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DWF_Dip_Generic_Offer_Greenskin_Positive_02	For once we may be able to resolve our differences without spilling blood… although, I doubt it. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DWF_Dip_Generic_Offer_Negative_01	Hear us, or my axe will speak in our stead.  	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DWF_Dip_Generic_Offer_Negative_02	By my beard, I'll make my demands clear and you'd best hear them. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DWF_Dip_Generic_Offer_Negative_03	Do you think we will suffer this outrage? Our demands are plain… 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DWF_Dip_Generic_Offer_Neutral_01	We have an offer, but one that must be answered quickly. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DWF_Dip_Generic_Offer_Neutral_02	The Dawi rarely make requests, so you'd best take note before we change our minds. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DWF_Dip_Generic_Offer_Neutral_03	By Morgrim's hammer, will you not hear our offer? 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DWF_Dip_Generic_Offer_Positive_01	Come now, the Clans promise there is profit to be made by being open to this offer. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DWF_Dip_Generic_Offer_Positive_02	Do you wish to hear our offer or not? The Guilds press upon me to make it. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DWF_Dip_Generic_Offer_Positive_03	Listen to my request and then we will drink good, Dwarfish ale until our beards curl!	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DWF_Dip_Generic_Offer_Vampire_Negative_01	I'll have your head, Zangunaz, but first here is a list of demands. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DWF_Dip_Generic_Offer_Vampire_Negative_02	What fell things the umgi created with you, Vampire – I demand you listen or we will crack open every one of your tombs. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DWF_Dip_Generic_Offer_Vampire_Neutral_01	I detest the Undead as much as the grobi, but still I must make this offer. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DWF_Dip_Generic_Offer_Vampire_Neutral_02	We have requests, Vampire. You would be wise to heed them. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DWF_Dip_Generic_Offer_Vampire_Positive_01	You think yourselves long-lived and even knowledgeable, but you know nothing of the mountain realms. Perhaps you would like to learn? 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DWF_Dip_Generic_Offer_Vampire_Positive_02	We have a request, Uzkular, will you consider it? 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DWF_Dip_Offer_Cooperation_01	We have a contract ready to sign and be done. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DWF_Dip_Offer_Cooperation_02	Ready to fight with the Dawi, lad? 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DWF_Dip_Offer_Cooperation_03	A treaty to enshrine our alliance and consider it a great honour, no doubt! 	false

diplomacy_strings_string_DWF_Dip_Offer_Cooperation_Bretonnia_02	Let us sign a treaty, Bretonnian. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DWF_Dip_Offer_Cooperation_Chaos_01	There's nothing good that will come of this, but a Dwarf's word is his bond. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DWF_Dip_Offer_Cooperation_Chaos_02	Creatures of Dum – you are used to signing pacts, yes? So sign this one. 	false

diplomacy_strings_string_DWF_Dip_Offer_Cooperation_Empire_02	Will the Empire sign a treaty and bring about an age long-thought past? 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DWF_Dip_Offer_Cooperation_Greenskin_01	I spit on you, Greenskin, but a treaty must be signed. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DWF_Dip_Offer_Cooperation_Greenskin_02	It may not be important to you, grobi, but I'll see that parchment signed and a treaty ratified! 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DWF_Dip_Offer_Cooperation_Vampire_01	Sign the treaty, Uzkular, so you can get from my sight! 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DWF_Dip_Offer_Cooperation_Vampire_02	We'll have a treaty but if I see one Dwarf corpse rise up, the accord will end and you shall taste vengeance! 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DWF_Dip_Offer_Gift_01	Come and share in the riches of the Karaz Ankor, friend. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DWF_Dip_Offer_Gift_02	A gift for you from the Clans. 	false

diplomacy_strings_string_DWF_Dip_Offer_Peace_01	Peace is difficult to come by, but now is the time for trade-talk, and beer, to flow. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DWF_Dip_Offer_Peace_02	A respite from war is a healthy thing. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DWF_Dip_Offer_Peace_03	Good! Battle is no fun if there is little time to drink and tell stories in-between the slaying! 	false

diplomacy_strings_string_DWF_Dip_Offer_Peace_Dwarf_01	The High King desires peace between the Holds. We should abide. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DWF_Dip_Offer_Peace_Dwarf_02	Peace – there is no glory in our kin fighting, not with so many urks to fight! 	false

diplomacy_strings_string_DWF_Dip_Offer_Peace_Empire_02	Now we shall have peace, umgi. Let's have a few tankards of "One-finger's Tar Drop" until you fall over drunk due to your weak constitutions.  	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DWF_Dip_Offer_Peace_Greenskin_01	Peace with Orcs! I doubt it, but we offer it anyway, despite our ancestors' scorn! 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DWF_Dip_Offer_Peace_Greenskin_02	We offer peace, not that we expect Greenskin scum to keep it! 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DWF_Dip_Offer_Peace_Vampire_01	Be gone, Vampires – back to your fetid realm and leave the Dawi be! 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DWF_Dip_Offer_Peace_Vampire_02	We offer peace, now back to the graves with you! 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DWF_Dip_Reject_Join_Confederation_01	Ha! The Dammaz Kron is full of your sins, we shall never ally! 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DWF_Dip_Reject_Join_Confederation_02	No alliance – not in this Age of Reckoning! 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DWF_Dip_Reject_Join_Confederation_03	You'll find no friends here – only hatred!  	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DWF_Dip_Reject_Peace_01	Peace, ha! Not while The Great Book of Grudges remains full! 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DWF_Dip_Reject_Peace_02	Our beards bristle at peace, urks – the thirst for war is too strong. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DWF_Dip_Reject_Peace_03	We reject this notion! There is no peace while Grimnir sharpens his az! 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DWF_Dip_Reject_Peace_Bretonnia_01	There are scores to settle and grudges to be righted with you, Bretonnian. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DWF_Dip_Reject_Peace_Bretonnia_02	You have lessons to learn, manling. Lessons that cannot be taught through peace. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DWF_Dip_Reject_Peace_Chaos_01	There cannot be peace with your Gods – we must fight until there is no breath in our bodies. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DWF_Dip_Reject_Peace_Chaos_02	Grungni give me strength! Do you mock us, Chaos scum? Of course we cannot have peace with your kind! 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DWF_Dip_Reject_Peace_Dwarf_01	The grudge is in the Great Book, there will never be peace until it is settled. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DWF_Dip_Reject_Peace_Dwarf_02	No, the war must continue until the penance is paid in full!	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DWF_Dip_Reject_Peace_Empire_01	You have wronged us, umgi, now you must pay the price. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DWF_Dip_Reject_Peace_Empire_02	Foolish manling – you think peace is that easy? 	false

diplomacy_strings_string_DWF_Dip_Reject_Peace_Greenskin_02	There will not – cannot – be peace with the urki and the grobi scum! 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DWF_Dip_Reject_Peace_Vampire_01	You are an enemy of Valaya, Zangunaz – peace is impossible.	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DWF_Dip_Reject_Peace_Vampire_02	Get back to your tombs, Vampire, and stay there. Then we will have peace but not until! 	false

diplomacy_strings_string_DWF_Dip_War_Dwarf_02	War it is, kins-Dwarf – you'd best be ready. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DWF_Dip_War_Empire_01	Axe versus sword, I like those odds, manling! To war! 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DWF_Dip_War_Empire_02	War then! To think we fought beside you in eons past! Never trust umgi, their memories are as short as their lives. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DWF_Dip_War_Greenskin_01	Now the urki and grobi will pay! Kazak! 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DWF_Dip_War_Greenskin_02	A great day indeed, let us battle with the urk scum until Grimnir himself joins us! 	false

diplomacy_strings_string_DWF_Grom_Dip_Greet_Neu_05	The Ancestors bow to no-one!	false

diplomacy_strings_string_DWF_Grom_Dip_Grskn_Greet_Pos_02	I'm surprised to see you here, Greenskin!	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DWF_Grom_Dip_Inter_Greet_Neg_01	Unbaraki! How dare you come here?!	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DWF_Grom_Dip_Inter_Greet_Neg_02	You are a disgrace! Gazul take you!	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DWF_Grom_Dip_Inter_Greet_Neu_01	Come on then, lad, grab a tankard and let's talk.	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DWF_Grom_Dip_Inter_Greet_Neu_02	Sit you down and tell me what it is you need.	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DWF_Grom_Dip_Inter_Greet_Pos_01	Khazukan! Welcome!	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DWF_Grom_Dip_Inter_Greet_Pos_02	Always happy to drink with a fellow Dawi!	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DWF_Grom_Dip_Vam_Greet_Neg_01	Zangunaz! My axe longs to be embedded in your skull!	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DWF_Grom_Dip_Vam_Greet_Neg_02	You know nothing of azazmar, you Undead fool!	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DWF_Grom_Dip_Vam_Greet_Neu_01	You Undead lot make my skin crawl!	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DWF_Grom_Dip_Vam_Greet_Neu_02	I can't promise you safe passage... My axe has a will of its own.	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DWF_Grom_Dip_Vam_Greet_Pos_01	The Undead is it? Go on then, speak.	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DWF_Grom_Dip_Vam_Greet_Pos_02	I'm not wasting good ale on you, let's make this quick.	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DWF_Lord1_Dip_Acceptance_Negative_01	I must have gold-sickness, as I agree! 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DWF_Lord1_Dip_Acceptance_Negative_02	We have an accord, but I curse your ancestors all the same. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DWF_Lord1_Dip_Acceptance_Negative_03	Dongliz! I cannot abide the notion, but we have no choice.	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DWF_Lord1_Dip_Acceptance_Neutral_01	Ip. That is "yes" in our tongue.	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DWF_Lord1_Dip_Acceptance_Neutral_02	Keep to your side, or this will be recorded in the Great Book. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DWF_Lord1_Dip_Acceptance_Neutral_03	We will drink to this accord. Hail the brewmaster! 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DWF_Lord1_Dip_Acceptance_Positive_01	We have an agreement. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DWF_Lord1_Dip_Acceptance_Positive_02	I have seen worse trades. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DWF_Lord1_Dip_Acceptance_Positive_03	Sign this contract, and we'll have a pact. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DWF_Lord1_Dip_Bret_Greet_Neg_01	The umgi are desperate if they send this excuse for an envoy.  	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DWF_Lord1_Dip_Bret_Greet_Neg_02	I have no patience for this. Say what you will, servant of Leoncoeur, and be done with it!	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DWF_Lord1_Dip_Bret_Greet_Neu_01	Greetings, Bretonnian, shed yourself of that Umgak armour and we can talk. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DWF_Lord1_Dip_Bret_Greet_Neu_02	Ahh, the Bretons come to parley, their realm must be in trouble. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DWF_Lord1_Dip_Bret_Greet_Pos_01	Well met, Knights of Bretonnia.	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DWF_Lord1_Dip_Bret_Greet_Pos_02	Hail, Bretonnians, what can the Dawi do for you? 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DWF_Lord1_Dip_Bretonnia_Acceptance_Negative_01	I do this, against the wishes of the Longbeards, I might add. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DWF_Lord1_Dip_Bretonnia_Acceptance_Negative_02	Agreed, but your treatment of the Grey Mountains will never be forgiven, umgi! 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DWF_Lord1_Dip_Bretonnia_Acceptance_Neutral_01	It is a fair treaty. I accept.	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DWF_Lord1_Dip_Bretonnia_Acceptance_Neutral_02	The terms are favourable, so we will work with the umgi on this cause. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DWF_Lord1_Dip_Bretonnia_Acceptance_Positive_01	Ai, we accept. Get your horses ready and your commonfolk armed. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DWF_Lord1_Dip_Bretonnia_Acceptance_Positive_02	We have always fought along side the umgi of both nations. Let us do so again. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DWF_Lord1_Dip_Bretonnia_Rejection_Negative_01	These umgi are even worse and more treacherous than that Empire lot! 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DWF_Lord1_Dip_Bretonnia_Rejection_Negative_02	No, you are unbaraki, and I shall not treat with you, Knight! 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DWF_Lord1_Dip_Bretonnia_Rejection_Neutral_01	I think not, umgi, pray to that woman in the water you are so keen on instead. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DWF_Lord1_Dip_Bretonnia_Rejection_Neutral_02	Unacceptable terms and a bad attitude in general. We will not work with you! 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DWF_Lord1_Dip_Bretonnia_Rejection_Positive_01	Nuf, we cannot hammer out terms. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DWF_Lord1_Dip_Bretonnia_Rejection_Positive_02	No, this time you go it alone, umgi. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DWF_Lord1_Dip_Chaos_Acceptance_Negative_01	Nothing good can come of this, but I have little choice… 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DWF_Lord1_Dip_Chaos_Acceptance_Negative_02	I debase myself in front of my ancestors by agreeing to this vile pact! 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DWF_Lord1_Dip_Chaos_Acceptance_Neutral_01	Bring me the Book of Grudges! I must write mine own name in it, for I accept the Chaos thing's terms. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DWF_Lord1_Dip_Chaos_Acceptance_Neutral_02	Alas, I agree, but let it be known I do this for the Karaz Ankor, and not for any promises of power whispered by this… creature. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DWF_Lord1_Dip_Chaos_Acceptance_Positive_01	An alliance then, a temporary pact at best. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DWF_Lord1_Dip_Chaos_Acceptance_Positive_02	I agree, even if it means shaving off my beard in disgust afterwards. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DWF_Lord1_Dip_Chaos_Greet_Neg_01	Chaos-kin, you dare come here and challenge me in front of mine throng! 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DWF_Lord1_Dip_Chaos_Greet_Neg_02	You are a pawn of vile powers, give me your message so I may reject it! 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DWF_Lord1_Dip_Chaos_Greet_Neu_01	I see before me Northmen, you speak for your vile Gods no doubt… 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DWF_Lord1_Dip_Chaos_Greet_Neu_02	I will hear you speak, pawn of Chaos, if only to deny your desire!	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DWF_Lord1_Dip_Chaos_Greet_Pos_01	Chaos comes, should we welcome you with open arms, spawn? 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DWF_Lord1_Dip_Chaos_Greet_Pos_02	Are you here to personally deliver news of the End Times? We got that message… 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DWF_Lord1_Dip_Chaos_Rejection_Negative_01	Northman, you are slime not worthy of any respect. I should kill you where you stand!	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DWF_Lord1_Dip_Chaos_Rejection_Negative_02	Bring my axe! I have a Chaos-puppet to slice into a thousand strands! 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DWF_Lord1_Dip_Chaos_Rejection_Neutral_01	Get out of my sight, Chaos-kin, before I have the Drengi hunt you down! 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DWF_Lord1_Dip_Chaos_Rejection_Neutral_02	The mere thought of working with them gives me the rutz. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DWF_Lord1_Dip_Chaos_Rejection_Positive_01	A foolish hope, sworn over gorl as tainted as your masters. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DWF_Lord1_Dip_Chaos_Rejection_Positive_02	Back to the north with you, fiend!	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DWF_Lord1_Dip_Dwarf_Acceptance_Negative_01	Very well, but this is Guild business. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DWF_Lord1_Dip_Dwarf_Acceptance_Negative_02	Agreed – why then does this taste like sour beer? 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DWF_Lord1_Dip_Dwarf_Acceptance_Neutral_01	This will enrich us all.  	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DWF_Lord1_Dip_Dwarf_Acceptance_Neutral_02	A fair deal and I'd expect nothing else from mine kin. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DWF_Lord1_Dip_Dwarf_Acceptance_Positive_01	Of course, together we are stronger!	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DWF_Lord1_Dip_Dwarf_Acceptance_Positive_02	Send away the Reckoners, we are done! An agreement is in place. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DWF_Lord1_Dip_Dwarf_Rejection_Negative_01	Not for all the Oathgold under your mountain! 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DWF_Lord1_Dip_Dwarf_Rejection_Negative_02	Wazzock! Get out of my sight! 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DWF_Lord1_Dip_Dwarf_Rejection_Neutral_01	I'm afraid Clan politics will put us at odds on this occasion. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DWF_Lord1_Dip_Dwarf_Rejection_Neutral_02	Come back when your beard has grown a fair few feet, Clans-Dwarf. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DWF_Lord1_Dip_Dwarf_Rejection_Positive_01	My blood boils like magma at the thought of it, but ni!	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DWF_Lord1_Dip_Dwarf_Rejection_Positive_02	Valaya weeps for I cannot help my kin this day. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DWF_Lord1_Dip_Dwf_Greet_Neg_01	What is your message, Clans-Dwarf? 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DWF_Lord1_Dip_Dwf_Greet_Neg_02	I do not trust your Clan, so speak and be done. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DWF_Lord1_Dip_Dwf_Greet_Neu_01	Welcome, Dawi, do you bring a gift of Gromril to aid in negotiations? 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DWF_Lord1_Dip_Dwf_Greet_Neu_02	Greetings kin of another Hold, what can I do for you? 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DWF_Lord1_Dip_Dwf_Greet_Pos_01	Come, come, kin, let us feast and drink! 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DWF_Lord1_Dip_Dwf_Greet_Pos_02	Dawi from another Hold arrive, tis a great day! 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DWF_Lord1_Dip_Emp_Greet_Neg_01	Times grow dark, and here come the umgi to lay their troubles at my feet! 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DWF_Lord1_Dip_Emp_Greet_Neg_02	I'm not in a good mood, manling, say your piece… 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DWF_Lord1_Dip_Emp_Greet_Neu_01	Greetings, umgi. How fares the Empire in these dark times? 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DWF_Lord1_Dip_Emp_Greet_Neu_02	Manlings come – they only do when they want something… 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DWF_Lord1_Dip_Emp_Greet_Pos_01	Welcome, men of the Empire. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DWF_Lord1_Dip_Emp_Greet_Pos_02	Hail to your Emperor, manlings. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DWF_Lord1_Dip_Empire_Acceptance_Negative_01	Ai, we'll help you out. You cannot trust the umgi to sort anything out themselves.  	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DWF_Lord1_Dip_Empire_Acceptance_Negative_02	My Longbeards tell me not to trust you and with just cause. Nevertheless, I accept. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DWF_Lord1_Dip_Empire_Acceptance_Neutral_01	Our kin share history, let us hope we will share the joy of battle together. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DWF_Lord1_Dip_Empire_Acceptance_Neutral_02	We have a treaty then, manling!	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DWF_Lord1_Dip_Empire_Acceptance_Positive_01	Of course, how could we not aid our most-trusted of allies?	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DWF_Lord1_Dip_Empire_Acceptance_Positive_02	Dawi and menfolk will work together again. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DWF_Lord1_Dip_Empire_Rejection_Negative_01	You are too short-lived and untrustworthy, Empire man. Now go. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DWF_Lord1_Dip_Empire_Rejection_Negative_02	I have no stomach for allying with the umgi, they always let us down… 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DWF_Lord1_Dip_Empire_Rejection_Neutral_01	Nai, my warriors grow restless, I have no time for the Empire. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DWF_Lord1_Dip_Empire_Rejection_Neutral_02	I cannot, but I wish your Empire well all the same. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DWF_Lord1_Dip_Empire_Rejection_Positive_01	Nai, not this time, umgi. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DWF_Lord1_Dip_Empire_Rejection_Positive_02	No doubt we will bring order, but not at this juncture.  	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DWF_Lord1_Dip_Greenskin_Acceptance_Negative_01	I will take the Slayer Oath in recompense, but for now, the Orc speaks sense. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DWF_Lord1_Dip_Greenskin_Acceptance_Negative_02	We must ally with the grobi, even if it marks us as unbaraki… 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DWF_Lord1_Dip_Greenskin_Acceptance_Neutral_01	I find nothing to fault here… other than working with grobi scum! 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DWF_Lord1_Dip_Greenskin_Acceptance_Neutral_02	It is a tacit agreement. Betray me, urks, and I will find every last one of you… 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DWF_Lord1_Dip_Greenskin_Acceptance_Positive_01	Ai, we have a pact. Do not betray us, urk. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DWF_Lord1_Dip_Greenskin_Acceptance_Positive_02	I cannot tell if the ancestors laugh or are shamed, yet we accept, Orc.	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DWF_Lord1_Dip_Greenskin_Rejection_Negative_01	Never! I will not rest until every last Goblin is a stain upon the ground! 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DWF_Lord1_Dip_Greenskin_Rejection_Negative_02	Ni, Orc, you shall never have such satisfaction! 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DWF_Lord1_Dip_Greenskin_Rejection_Neutral_01	Do you take me for some beardling? Get out! 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DWF_Lord1_Dip_Greenskin_Rejection_Neutral_02	The whole notion reeks of Skrati thinking. I'll never work with the Greenskins. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DWF_Lord1_Dip_Greenskin_Rejection_Positive_01	We are enemies, urk, no matter what you may wish. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DWF_Lord1_Dip_Greenskin_Rejection_Positive_02	Back to your mobs, Greenskin, tell them no Dawi will treat with you! 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DWF_Lord1_Dip_Greet_Neg_01	You dare approach a Lord of the Dawi in such a manner? 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DWF_Lord1_Dip_Greet_Neg_02	Talk at me in your crude language if you must, I make no promises as to the outcome. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DWF_Lord1_Dip_Greet_Neg_03	Come then, messenger, spit out your words so I can be done with them! 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DWF_Lord1_Dip_Greet_Neu_01	My throng stands ready, do not disappoint me.	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DWF_Lord1_Dip_Greet_Neu_02	Make your proposal, my Longbeards grumble, so make it quick! 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DWF_Lord1_Dip_Greet_Neu_03	You may speak before my shieldbearers and on the oath stone. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DWF_Lord1_Dip_Greet_Pos_01	Honour to your ancestors!	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DWF_Lord1_Dip_Greet_Pos_02	And what can the Dawi do for you on this fine day? 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DWF_Lord1_Dip_Greet_Pos_03	Ai, let's hear what you have to say, we'll hear it before oathgold. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DWF_Lord1_Dip_Grskn_Greet_Neg_01	You have seconds to live, Orc, speak quickly before you die in agony! 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DWF_Lord1_Dip_Grskn_Greet_Neg_02	Ugh! The Greenskins come. Their stench precedes them…	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DWF_Lord1_Dip_Grskn_Greet_Neu_01	Come then, grobi, let us hear your message. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DWF_Lord1_Dip_Grskn_Greet_Neu_02	Orcs come seeking parley! Have the mountains tuned on their sides? 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DWF_Lord1_Dip_Grskn_Greet_Pos_01	Ha, in all my days I never thought to see a grobi come begging for favours! 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DWF_Lord1_Dip_Grskn_Greet_Pos_02	The Orcs bring forth an envoy! Grimnir's blessings on such wonders! 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DWF_Lord1_Dip_Rejection_Negative_01	This was a fool's errand. Be gone! 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DWF_Lord1_Dip_Rejection_Negative_02	Nai! You shame your ancestors, not mine. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DWF_Lord1_Dip_Rejection_Negative_03	Do you take me for some beardling high on fool's gold? 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DWF_Lord1_Dip_Rejection_Neutral_01	Nai, nai, and thrice nai… 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DWF_Lord1_Dip_Rejection_Neutral_02	I do not like the terms, go back to your masters and try again. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DWF_Lord1_Dip_Rejection_Neutral_03	I serve the High King, not your masters. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DWF_Lord1_Dip_Rejection_Positive_01	Alas, our ideals differ greatly. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DWF_Lord1_Dip_Rejection_Positive_02	Unfortunately, that would not be in the best interests of the Karaz Ankor. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DWF_Lord1_Dip_Rejection_Positive_03	I refuse. My reasons are my own. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DWF_Lord1_Dip_Vamp_Greet_Neg_01	The days are dark, the end times come, and here is proof – Zangunaz come to treat with me. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DWF_Lord1_Dip_Vamp_Greet_Neg_02	As long as I am Lord, this thing will receive no hospitality from me! 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DWF_Lord1_Dip_Vamp_Greet_Neu_01	It is a brave or stupid Necromancer that approaches me unarmed. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DWF_Lord1_Dip_Vamp_Greet_Neu_02	Very well, say what you must, Vampire, but I make no promises. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DWF_Lord1_Dip_Vamp_Greet_Pos_01	A strange day – I find disgusting envoys of Vampires approaching me. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DWF_Lord1_Dip_Vamp_Greet_Pos_02	What do you want, blood drinker? 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DWF_Lord1_Dip_Vampire_Acceptance_Negative_01	A grave time for the Karaz Ankor, and yet I must say yes. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DWF_Lord1_Dip_Vampire_Acceptance_Negative_02	We have a deal, Uzkular, but don’t mistake this for leniency when it comes to battle. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DWF_Lord1_Dip_Vampire_Acceptance_Neutral_01	The whole thing tastes like ash in my mouth but ai, it will be done. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DWF_Lord1_Dip_Vampire_Acceptance_Neutral_02	Agreed, now get out. Your form sickens me! 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DWF_Lord1_Dip_Vampire_Acceptance_Positive_01	I will do anything to bring glory to the Hold. If that means working with Uzkular, so be it.	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DWF_Lord1_Dip_Vampire_Acceptance_Positive_02	Many would mither at such a pact, but it is for the best.  	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DWF_Lord1_Dip_Vampire_Rejection_Negative_01	Nai, nuf – whatever language you wish it in, Vampire… NO!	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DWF_Lord1_Dip_Vampire_Rejection_Negative_02	Vile creature! I should strike you down with my axe where you stand! 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DWF_Lord1_Dip_Vampire_Rejection_Neutral_01	I cannot in good conscience submit my throng to that. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DWF_Lord1_Dip_Vampire_Rejection_Neutral_02	No, I will not sully the sons and daughters of this Hold by allying with Zangunaz. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DWF_Lord1_Dip_Vampire_Rejection_Positive_01	A ridiculous notion. Now be gone, Undead. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DWF_Lord1_Dip_Vampire_Rejection_Positive_02	I think not! 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DWF_Lord2_Dip_Bret_Greet_Neg_01	The umgi are desperate if they send this excuse for an envoy.  	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DWF_Lord2_Dip_Bret_Greet_Neg_02	I have no patience for this. Say what you will, servant of Leoncoeur, and be done with it!	false

diplomacy_strings_string_DWF_Lord2_Dip_Chaos_Greet_Neg_01	Chaos-kin, you dare come here and challenge me in front of mine throng! 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DWF_Lord2_Dip_Chaos_Greet_Neg_02	You are a pawn of vile powers, give me your message so I may reject it! 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DWF_Lord2_Dip_Chaos_Greet_Neu_01	I see before me Northmen, you speak for your vile Gods no doubt… 	false

diplomacy_strings_string_DWF_Lord2_Dip_Chaos_Greet_Pos_02	Are you here to personally deliver news of the End Times? We got that message… 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DWF_Lord2_Dip_Dwf_Greet_Neg_01	What is your message, Clans-Dwarf? 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DWF_Lord2_Dip_Dwf_Greet_Neg_02	I do not trust your Clan, so speak and be done. 	false

diplomacy_strings_string_DWF_Thor_Dip_Bret_Greet_Pos_02	Welcome, Knights of Bretonnia.	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DWF_Thor_Dip_Bretonnia_Acceptance_Negative_01	We agree, but the shame of your actions in the Grey Mountains makes you untrustworthy, manling. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DWF_Thor_Dip_Bretonnia_Acceptance_Negative_02	Ai, it is an accord, but betray us and you'll all pay, Bretonnian. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DWF_Thor_Dip_Bretonnia_Acceptance_Neutral_01	I accept. Tell your ruler that the High King agrees. 	false

diplomacy_strings_string_DWF_Thor_Dip_Bretonnia_Acceptance_Positive_01	An agreement it is then – I realise you drink that Elven muck, wine, but today we toast with Dwarfish ale! 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DWF_Thor_Dip_Bretonnia_Acceptance_Positive_02	Ai, Bretonnian, it is an accord. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DWF_Thor_Dip_Bretonnia_Rejection_Negative_01	Get out! Another entry in the Dammaz Kron! 	false

diplomacy_strings_string_DWF_Thor_Dip_Bretonnia_Rejection_Neutral_02	Not this time, umgi. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DWF_Thor_Dip_Bretonnia_Rejection_Positive_01	I have to say nai, on this occasion. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DWF_Thor_Dip_Bretonnia_Rejection_Positive_02	We may work together in the future, but not now, umgi. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DWF_Thor_Dip_Chaos_Acceptance_Negative_01	It will be, but make no mistake, dumal-scum, I despise this as much as your fell Gods. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DWF_Thor_Dip_Chaos_Acceptance_Negative_02	So be it, but do not cross me, Dum-kin. I swear on my oath stone you will regret it!	false

diplomacy_strings_string_DWF_Thor_Dip_Chaos_Greet_Neg_01	I will not sully the High King's mantle by speaking to Chaos things! 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DWF_Thor_Dip_Chaos_Greet_Neg_02	Chaos, how dare you entreat me! Filth! Spawn! Thagi-Kin! 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DWF_Thor_Dip_Chaos_Greet_Neu_01	Chaos! Even saying it burns my throat. Speak, scum, and be quick! 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DWF_Thor_Dip_Chaos_Greet_Neu_02	I will not parley with thralls of Dark Gods, so choose your words carefully. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DWF_Thor_Dip_Chaos_Greet_Pos_01	I will listen, spawn, but don't expect me to act on anything your vile masters request. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DWF_Thor_Dip_Chaos_Greet_Pos_02	Say what you must, puppet of Chaos… 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DWF_Thor_Dip_Chaos_Rejection_Negative_01	Never, vile filth! To even suggest such a thing will bring your death! 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DWF_Thor_Dip_Chaos_Rejection_Negative_02	Take this message back to your unbaraki masters. The Dawi will scour the mountains of you! 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DWF_Thor_Dip_Chaos_Rejection_Neutral_01	The next we see each other it will be in battle and Grimnir's axe will taste your blood! 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DWF_Thor_Dip_Chaos_Rejection_Neutral_02	By the Dragon Crown, the Dawi will never side with Chaos! 	false

diplomacy_strings_string_DWF_Thor_Dip_Dwarf_Acceptance_Negative_02	An accord then, but your ledgers are marked! 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DWF_Thor_Dip_Dwarf_Acceptance_Neutral_01	An alliance of our Clans! 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DWF_Thor_Dip_Dwarf_Acceptance_Neutral_02	Ai, our Holds will unite. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DWF_Thor_Dip_Dwarf_Acceptance_Positive_01	By the Ancestor Gods, yes! 	false

diplomacy_strings_string_DWF_Thor_Dip_Emp_Greet_Neg_01	I have no time, for you foolish, manlings, spit out your demands! 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DWF_Thor_Dip_Emp_Greet_Neg_02	The old alliance is dead, so don't come here asking favours! 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DWF_Thor_Dip_Emp_Greet_Neu_01	Hail to your Emperor! What can I do for you? 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DWF_Thor_Dip_Emp_Greet_Neu_02	Don't mumble, manling, I can't stand mumblers… 	false

diplomacy_strings_string_DWF_Thor_Dip_Empire_Acceptance_Negative_02	I agree, but I'll be keeping a close eye. I don't trust umgi anymore – you are too fickle. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DWF_Thor_Dip_Empire_Acceptance_Neutral_01	Very well, the Dawi and umgi will work together. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DWF_Thor_Dip_Empire_Acceptance_Neutral_02	The runes favour it, so we shall ally again. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DWF_Thor_Dip_Empire_Acceptance_Positive_01	We shall strike an alliance, just as our ancestors did! 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DWF_Thor_Dip_Empire_Acceptance_Positive_02	The old alliance remains alive! 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DWF_Thor_Dip_Empire_Rejection_Negative_01	I think not. Get out, and tell Franz I'll have him! 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DWF_Thor_Dip_Empire_Rejection_Negative_02	Ni, your Empire is no match for mine.  	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DWF_Thor_Dip_Empire_Rejection_Neutral_01	No, the Dammaz Kron is too full of manling grudges! 	false

diplomacy_strings_string_DWF_Thor_Dip_Empire_Rejection_Positive_01	Alas, I cannot agree, you're on your own this time, umgi. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DWF_Thor_Dip_Empire_Rejection_Positive_02	No, we walk different roads on this occasion, manling. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DWF_Thor_Dip_Greenskin_Acceptance_Negative_01	For this moment and this thrice-cursed moment only, we side with urk-scum. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DWF_Thor_Dip_Greenskin_Acceptance_Negative_02	I will take the Slayer Oath myself, but we must work with these vile creatures! 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DWF_Thor_Dip_Greenskin_Acceptance_Neutral_01	Although it causes me to gag to even say it, we agree with the Greenskins. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DWF_Thor_Dip_Greenskin_Acceptance_Neutral_02	Then we work with the grobi, pray to the ancestors it is not for long! 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DWF_Thor_Dip_Greenskin_Acceptance_Positive_01	Let the chroniclers record this – Dawi and urks working together! 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DWF_Thor_Dip_Greenskin_Acceptance_Positive_02	Ai, I'll work with the Greenskins if it means the Reckoning will prevail. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DWF_Thor_Dip_Greenskin_Rejection_Negative_01	Ni! I would rather hug an elgi than work with Orc-spawn. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DWF_Thor_Dip_Greenskin_Rejection_Negative_02	Bring me my axe, so I may slay this wretched grobi filth for even suggesting such a thing! 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DWF_Thor_Dip_Greenskin_Rejection_Neutral_01	I will not shame the Royal Clan by agreeing to anything with urks. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DWF_Thor_Dip_Greenskin_Rejection_Neutral_02	Get out of my presence, Orc, before my Hammerers smash you in twain. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DWF_Thor_Dip_Greenskin_Rejection_Positive_01	Ha! Work with the grobi! You must think I'm a wattock!  	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DWF_Thor_Dip_Greenskin_Rejection_Positive_02	Stop wasting my time, Greenskin. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DWF_Thor_Dip_Greet_Neg_01	Do not sully my presence any longer than you must!	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DWF_Thor_Dip_Greet_Neg_02	I am the High King, I will hear you beg now! 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DWF_Thor_Dip_Greet_Neg_03	Talk then, but I make no oath for the surety of your life… 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DWF_Thor_Dip_Greet_Neu_01	What brings you to the halls of my ancestors? 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DWF_Thor_Dip_Greet_Neu_02	Greetings… what do you require of the Karaz Ankor?   	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DWF_Thor_Dip_Greet_Neu_03	Ask your favour and I will check with the Dammaz Kron that you are worthy… 	false

diplomacy_strings_string_DWF_Thor_Dip_Grskn_Greet_Neg_02	I thought I smelt urk stench!	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DWF_Thor_Dip_Grskn_Greet_Neu_01	Orc scum! Here? Speak, then, in your bestial tongue… 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DWF_Thor_Dip_Grskn_Greet_Neu_02	You bring urks before the High King?! 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DWF_Thor_Dip_Grskn_Greet_Pos_01	Urks, here!? I didn't even realise they could talk let alone reason… 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DWF_Thor_Dip_Grskn_Greet_Pos_02	You catch me in good humour, Greenskin, I'll hear your proposal.	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DWF_Thor_Dip_Rejection_Negative_01	Ha-Ha! Never! Now, be gone from my halls, my realm, my kingdom! 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DWF_Thor_Dip_Rejection_Negative_02	Nai, you have made a grave mistake coming here. One that shall be marked in the Dammaz Kron. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DWF_Thor_Dip_Rejection_Negative_03	Get out of my halls!!! 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DWF_Thor_Dip_Rejection_Neutral_01	It seems you have wronged us! We cannot do business. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DWF_Thor_Dip_Rejection_Neutral_02	We will not strike any deals with you this day or ever! 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DWF_Thor_Dip_Rejection_Neutral_03	Walk away… 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DWF_Thor_Dip_Rejection_Positive_01	It is with regret, but nai!	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DWF_Thor_Dip_Rejection_Positive_02	Not this time, have your sires return in several generations. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DWF_Thor_Dip_Rejection_Positive_03	I cannot accept on this occasion. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DWF_Thor_Dip_Vamp_Greet_Neg_01	Get my axe! Why should I hear you speak, Zangunaz! 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DWF_Thor_Dip_Vamp_Greet_Neg_02	Vampire! …why do you darken my halls with your foul presence?	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DWF_Thor_Dip_Vamp_Greet_Neu_01	Now then, Blood Drinker, this had better be good… 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DWF_Thor_Dip_Vamp_Greet_Neu_02	I despise the Unliving, so state your case while I'm still inclined to listen. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DWF_Thor_Dip_Vamp_Greet_Pos_01	Speak, Zangunaz, then I will decide if you keep your head. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DWF_Thor_Dip_Vamp_Greet_Pos_02	I will hear you, Vampire, this once. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DWF_Thor_Dip_Vampire_Acceptance_Negative_01	Cover the eyes of the ancestor statues… I agree. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DWF_Thor_Dip_Vampire_Acceptance_Negative_02	Curse all Uzkular! For the good of the realm I accept. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DWF_Thor_Dip_Vampire_Acceptance_Neutral_01	Very well, Zangunaz. To the eternal shame of the Karaz Ankor, I agree. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DWF_Thor_Dip_Vampire_Acceptance_Neutral_02	I do this because I must… 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DWF_Thor_Dip_Vampire_Acceptance_Positive_01	It is an accord, be it one I find repellent. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DWF_Thor_Dip_Vampire_Acceptance_Positive_02	A dark day for the Dawi, but we shall ally. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DWF_Thor_Dip_Vampire_Rejection_Negative_01	Never! Get ye gone, Undead thing! 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DWF_Thor_Dip_Vampire_Rejection_Negative_02	The High King would never deign to parley with the likes of you, creature! 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DWF_Thor_Dip_Vampire_Rejection_Neutral_01	Get out Uzkular! Never darken my presence again! 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DWF_Thor_Dip_Vampire_Rejection_Neutral_02	I will not sully my ancestors by talking to the likes of you! 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DWF_Thor_Dip_Vampire_Rejection_Positive_01	I will not parley with the Undead. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DWF_Thor_Dip_Vampire_Rejection_Positive_02	Blood drinkers and tomb robbers, be gone! 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DWF_Ungrim_Dip_Acceptance_Negative_01	I am used to taking conflicting oaths, so I will accept your offer while despising you!	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DWF_Ungrim_Dip_Acceptance_Negative_02	I do not break oaths so I accept, but don't mistake that for liking it.	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DWF_Ungrim_Dip_Acceptance_Negative_03	My axe thirsts for your blood… but we have an agreement.	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DWF_Ungrim_Dip_Acceptance_Neutral_01	We have an oath of agreement, pray you don't break it.	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DWF_Ungrim_Dip_Acceptance_Neutral_02	My Drengi would rather fight you… but this time I'll accept.	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DWF_Ungrim_Dip_Acceptance_Neutral_03	I am the last Slayer King. There is an accord in place, do not betray it. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DWF_Ungrim_Dip_Acceptance_Positive_01	Let us drink to this. Break out the Bugman's!	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DWF_Ungrim_Dip_Acceptance_Positive_02	Then it is done. We will celebrate by matching blades!	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DWF_Ungrim_Dip_Acceptance_Positive_03	Ai, Grimnir smiles on us!	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DWF_Ungrim_Dip_Bretonnia_Acceptance_Negative_01	Very well, manling, I hope your nags are up to the job.	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DWF_Ungrim_Dip_Bretonnia_Acceptance_Negative_02	Very well, Bretonnian, but my Slayers will take convincing.	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DWF_Ungrim_Dip_Bretonnia_Acceptance_Neutral_01	A tacit agreement it is. Keep your side, umgi.	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DWF_Ungrim_Dip_Bretonnia_Acceptance_Neutral_02	Let us toast to an accord, but not with that donkey drek you consider drink.	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DWF_Ungrim_Dip_Bretonnia_Acceptance_Positive_01	Our Ancestors will sing about this for many generations!	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DWF_Ungrim_Dip_Bretonnia_Acceptance_Positive_02	Ai, men and Dwarfs will ally again with the Slayer throng!	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DWF_Ungrim_Dip_Bretonnia_Greeting_Negative_01	So, Bretonnian, you come all this way. Your message better have more substance than the wine you drink!	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DWF_Ungrim_Dip_Bretonnia_Greeting_Negative_02	Deliver the message from your king, manling, but your view of chivalry differs from mine.	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DWF_Ungrim_Dip_Bretonnia_Greeting_Neutral_01	The men of Bretonnia, what brings your noble behinds to Kadrin?	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DWF_Ungrim_Dip_Bretonnia_Greeting_Neutral_02	I see horse lords of the Bretons approach me. What could they want?	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DWF_Ungrim_Dip_Bretonnia_Greeting_Positive_01	Bring forth the beer, the Bretonnians have arrived to save the day!	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DWF_Ungrim_Dip_Bretonnia_Greeting_Positive_02	Come forth, men of fair Bretonnia, Kadrin welcomes you.	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DWF_Ungrim_Dip_Bretonnia_Rejection_Negative_01	We don't need your help, Bretonnian. We are the Slayers of Karak Kadrin!	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DWF_Ungrim_Dip_Bretonnia_Rejection_Negative_02	I think not, manling, tell Leoncoeur he is on his own.	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DWF_Ungrim_Dip_Bretonnia_Rejection_Neutral_01	No umgi, nai, take your armoured nags and do one!	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DWF_Ungrim_Dip_Bretonnia_Rejection_Neutral_02	If I was purely Drengi, then it would be yes, alas, I'm also king, so the answer is no.	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DWF_Ungrim_Dip_Bretonnia_Rejection_Positive_01	No, manling, what you propose is no benefit to my Slayer-kin.	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DWF_Ungrim_Dip_Bretonnia_Rejection_Positive_02	As king, I must make tough choices. This is one, Bretonnian, I decline.	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DWF_Ungrim_Dip_Chaos_Acceptance_Negative_01	I do not like it! Working with Chaos... Grimnir will shun me for this!	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DWF_Ungrim_Dip_Chaos_Acceptance_Negative_02	A dark day, but it must be done.	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DWF_Ungrim_Dip_Chaos_Acceptance_Neutral_01	It is something I must consider, but it galls me!	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DWF_Ungrim_Dip_Chaos_Acceptance_Neutral_02	This has to be…	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DWF_Ungrim_Dip_Chaos_Acceptance_Positive_01	The Slayers will work with Chaos scum but this is one day I wish to forget.	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DWF_Ungrim_Dip_Chaos_Acceptance_Positive_02	The Throng agrees, for Kadrin and the Karaz Ankor. May our sires forgive us!	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DWF_Ungrim_Dip_Chaos_Greeting_Negative_01	I thought it stank of skruti – what do you want, pawn of Chaos?	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DWF_Ungrim_Dip_Chaos_Greeting_Negative_02	Vile creature, do not dare to enter my halls – do not dare to even talk to me!	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DWF_Ungrim_Dip_Chaos_Greeting_Neutral_01	Say what you have to say, spawn-kin, but do not taint Khazalid, I'll hear you in the common tongue.	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DWF_Ungrim_Dip_Chaos_Greeting_Neutral_02	My axe yearns for your throat, dumal-umgi, so you'd better speak quickly.	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DWF_Ungrim_Dip_Chaos_Greeting_Positive_01	Stay where you are, servant of Chaos. Take not one further step, I'll hear you there.	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DWF_Ungrim_Dip_Chaos_Greeting_Positive_02	I will hear you out, but I warn you, my blood runs hot for your death!	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DWF_Ungrim_Dip_Chaos_Rejection_Negative_01	I would rather lop off my dongliz than work with this scum!	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DWF_Ungrim_Dip_Chaos_Rejection_Negative_02	By all the Slayers of Karak Kadrin, nai!	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DWF_Ungrim_Dip_Chaos_Rejection_Neutral_01	Get thee gone, Dumal Kruti!	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DWF_Ungrim_Dip_Chaos_Rejection_Neutral_02	Never will the Dawi ally with Chaos!	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DWF_Ungrim_Dip_Chaos_Rejection_Positive_01	It is a fine and foolish thing you suggest, Spawn. One I gladly decline.	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DWF_Ungrim_Dip_Chaos_Rejection_Positive_02	Ni – you take me for a fool instead of a king, Chaos filth?	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DWF_Ungrim_Dip_Dwarf_Acceptance_Negative_01	Ani, we have an accord, but your clan is not one I take pleasure in working with.	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DWF_Ungrim_Dip_Dwarf_Acceptance_Negative_02	Your clan has never been a friend of Kadrin, but I accept on this occasion.	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DWF_Ungrim_Dip_Dwarf_Acceptance_Neutral_01	Ai, for the Karaz Ankor!	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DWF_Ungrim_Dip_Dwarf_Acceptance_Neutral_02	We will join our throngs and the Urks will quail!	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DWF_Ungrim_Dip_Dwarf_Acceptance_Positive_01	It is an honour!	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DWF_Ungrim_Dip_Dwarf_Acceptance_Positive_02	Khazukan Kazakit-ha!	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DWF_Ungrim_Dip_Dwarf_Greeting_Negative_01	Speak then, clans-Dwarf, but don't expect my response to be to your liking.	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DWF_Ungrim_Dip_Dwarf_Greeting_Negative_02	Your beard is short, Dawi; it makes you untrustworthy in my eyes.	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DWF_Ungrim_Dip_Dwarf_Greeting_Neutral_01	Hail to the Holds! How may I aid your clan this day?	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DWF_Ungrim_Dip_Dwarf_Greeting_Neutral_02	The Slayers of Karak Kadrin, greet you, clans-Dwarf.	false
diplomacy_strings_string_DWF_Ungrim_Dip_Dwarf_Greeting_Positive_01	My kin, the throng of Kadrin welcomes you.	false

diplomacy_strings_string_EMP_Dip_Cancel_Treaty_02	The treaty is ended! A regretful decision but one that had to be made. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_EMP_Dip_Cancel_Treaty_03	The Arch-Lectors counsel against continuing this treaty. It is finished. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_EMP_Dip_Demand_Join_War_01	Muster your armies! Sigmar and all the gods demand blood! 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_EMP_Dip_Demand_Join_War_02	War has come, time to answer Ulric's summons. 	false

diplomacy_strings_string_EMP_Dip_Generic_Offer_Empire_Neutral_02	I know you have not forsaken Sigmar, prove it to us by hearing our proposal. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_EMP_Dip_Generic_Offer_Empire_Positive_01	The Empire should be united under Ghal Maraz. Hear us out, friend. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_EMP_Dip_Generic_Offer_Empire_Positive_02	You do not doubt who is the true Emperor. That is progress, so I make this offer.	false
diplomacy_strings_string_EMP_Dip_Generic_Offer_Greenskin_Negative_01	Are you capable of listening to our terms, Greenskin? I doubt it! 	false

diplomacy_strings_string_EMP_Dip_Generic_Offer_Vampire_Negative_01	We do not treat with the Undead! But for now we must…  	false
diplomacy_strings_string_EMP_Dip_Generic_Offer_Vampire_Negative_02	Know that you will never take the mantle of Emperor, corpse-creature - still we have a proposal… 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_EMP_Dip_Generic_Offer_Vampire_Neutral_01	Morr will shun us for such heresy, but there are terms… 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_EMP_Dip_Generic_Offer_Vampire_Neutral_02	Keep your fangs behind your lips, vile thing! Here is our offer. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_EMP_Dip_Generic_Offer_Vampire_Positive_01	Perhaps one day we will recognise Sylvania as a rightful province. Until that doomed time, we may be able to strike a deal. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_EMP_Dip_Generic_Offer_Vampire_Positive_02	It is our sad duty to engage with such abominations… never-the-less, we have a proposal… 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_EMP_Dip_Offer_Cooperation_01	Perhaps a treaty?	false
diplomacy_strings_string_EMP_Dip_Offer_Cooperation_02	The wisdom of Verena guides us to co-operation… 	false

diplomacy_strings_string_EMP_Dip_Offer_Cooperation_Chaos_02	I cannot believe I ask this… a treaty with the Northmen is sought. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_EMP_Dip_Offer_Cooperation_Dwarf_01	As we fought together many times in the last two and half millennia, I ask again - will you join us? 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_EMP_Dip_Offer_Cooperation_Dwarf_02	The Empire and Dwarfs should march together as they once did? 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_EMP_Dip_Offer_Cooperation_Empire_01	As Magnus the Pious taught us, a united Empire is better than one riven by spite and jealously…	false
diplomacy_strings_string_EMP_Dip_Offer_Cooperation_Empire_02	Come, men of the Empire, let us fight under one banner again. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_EMP_Dip_Offer_Cooperation_Greenskin_01	Though it pains me to consider it, consider it I must - a pact? 	false

diplomacy_strings_string_EMP_Dip_Offer_Cooperation_Vampire_02	If you can stop feeding on our citizens for a while we may be able to hammer out a treaty to suit both living and dead… 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_EMP_Dip_Offer_Gift_01	It is a simple gift, gold. Sigmar preferred such things also. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_EMP_Dip_Offer_Gift_02	We offer a small token, blessed by the Arch-Lector and worthy of your status. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_EMP_Dip_Offer_Gift_03	Here is a gift with Sigmar's blessing - use it as you will. Now, to business!	false

diplomacy_strings_string_EMP_Dip_Offer_Join_War_02	We offer our hammers, let us fight with you! 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_EMP_Dip_Offer_Join_War_03	The Empire hears your call and comes ready to make war! 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_EMP_Dip_Offer_Peace_01	The sword becomes blunted from constant use, the hammer weighs heavy. Now is the time to consider peace.	false
diplomacy_strings_string_EMP_Dip_Offer_Peace_02	A strong nation does not mean one constantly at war. Peace is achievable.  	false
diplomacy_strings_string_EMP_Dip_Offer_Peace_03	Peace in our age? We can but hope… 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_EMP_Dip_Offer_Peace_Bretonnia_01	Put down your lances, there is no need for war. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_EMP_Dip_Offer_Peace_Bretonnia_02	Come Bretonnian, would you not rather drink wine than make war? 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_EMP_Dip_Offer_Peace_Chaos_01	We wish to broker peace, Northman, are you even capable? 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_EMP_Dip_Offer_Peace_Chaos_02	We are not at the End Times yet, Chaos scum. It is time to fight on a different front. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_EMP_Dip_Offer_Peace_Dwarf_01	Come Dwarfs, let us be allies again. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_EMP_Dip_Offer_Peace_Dwarf_02	Together we can help rebuild the Karaz Ankor. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_EMP_Dip_Offer_Peace_Empire_01	Unite with us friends, make Magnus the Pious proud of our generation.	false
diplomacy_strings_string_EMP_Dip_Offer_Peace_Empire_02	This is no Age of the Three Emperors, we must sue for peace.	false
diplomacy_strings_string_EMP_Dip_Offer_Peace_Greenskin_01	Fight amongst yourselves, Orcs. Keep us out of this! 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_EMP_Dip_Offer_Peace_Greenskin_02	Do the Greenskins even understand… peace? 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_EMP_Dip_Offer_Peace_Vampire_01	Von Carsteins - you have had your tally of corpses. The war must end. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_EMP_Dip_Offer_Peace_Vampire_02	We seek peace. Even the Undead must rest at some point. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_EMP_Dip_Reject_Join_Confederation_01	These are Sigmar's people and nobody else's!	false
diplomacy_strings_string_EMP_Dip_Reject_Join_Confederation_02	There will be no alliance while I draw breath! 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_EMP_Dip_Reject_Join_Confederation_03	I swear by Sigmar's comet and the wolves of Ulric that we will never join with you! 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_EMP_Dip_Reject_Peace_01	No, my men crave glory, and I plan on giving it to them. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_EMP_Dip_Reject_Peace_02	There is no peace - there is only war! 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_EMP_Dip_Reject_Peace_03	Sigmar is a warrior's god; I cannot appease him with talk of peace. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_EMP_Dip_Reject_Peace_Bretonnia_01	The king has gone too far, we must teach him a lesson. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_EMP_Dip_Reject_Peace_Bretonnia_02	Bretonnia must be chastised for its actions - the war continues! 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_EMP_Dip_Reject_Peace_Chaos_01	Peace with the followers of the Dark Gods? No, scum, never! 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_EMP_Dip_Reject_Peace_Chaos_02	Get from my sight, Chaos filth, and know we will fight on! 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_EMP_Dip_Reject_Peace_Dwarf_01	We have been shackled by the Dwarfs for long enough, let them bear us a grudge! 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_EMP_Dip_Reject_Peace_Dwarf_02	The Dwarfs will know that their time is over! 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_EMP_Dip_Reject_Peace_Empire_01	A lesson must be taught, so the usurpers know who is the true Emperor. 	false

diplomacy_strings_string_EMP_Dip_War_Empire_01	You leave me no choice but to declare war, and Sigmar damn your hides for making it so! 	false

diplomacy_strings_string_EMP_Gelt_Dip_Emp_Greet_Pos_01	Greetings in Sigmar's name.	false
diplomacy_strings_string_EMP_Gelt_Dip_Emp_Greet_Pos_02	The Empire's unity is the surest shield against our enemies.	false
diplomacy_strings_string_EMP_Gelt_Dip_Greet_Neg_01	Interesting. The Bright Order are seeking targets for their initiates to practice on. And here you are...	false
diplomacy_strings_string_EMP_Gelt_Dip_Greet_Neg_02	A face such as yours would make for an interesting gilded statue. I have a spell for that, you know…	false

diplomacy_strings_string_EMP_Gelt_Dip_Greet_Neu_01	I will set aside my studies for a moment to hear your words.	false

diplomacy_strings_string_EMP_Gelt_Dip_Greet_Pos_02	Friendship is more valuable than gold. Or so they tell me.	false

diplomacy_strings_string_EMP_Genrl1_Dip_Acceptance_Negative_01	Even though this is against the Grand Theogonist's will, I accept.   	false
diplomacy_strings_string_EMP_Genrl1_Dip_Acceptance_Negative_02	I agree to this pact, but betray me and suffer the wrath of the Empire! 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_EMP_Genrl1_Dip_Acceptance_Negative_03	Be warned - I spit blood at this agreement and expect you to break it! 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_EMP_Genrl1_Dip_Acceptance_Neutral_01	I have the authority to sign such a treaty. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_EMP_Genrl1_Dip_Acceptance_Neutral_02	Sigmar was not just a warrior but a diplomat too. I take his example and agree. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_EMP_Genrl1_Dip_Acceptance_Neutral_03	We have an agreement. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_EMP_Genrl1_Dip_Acceptance_Positive_01	If the Emperor bids, then it is so. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_EMP_Genrl1_Dip_Acceptance_Positive_02	Very well - we have an agreement. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_EMP_Genrl1_Dip_Acceptance_Positive_03	A solemn pact. Sigmar will decide if this is wise. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_EMP_Genrl1_Dip_Bret_Greet_Neg_01	It is late in the day for Bretonnia to come running on their ponies demanding aid. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_EMP_Genrl1_Dip_Bret_Greet_Neg_02	Here come the embodiment of mounted arrogance, the Bretonnian Knights! 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_EMP_Genrl1_Dip_Bret_Greet_Neu_01	Greetings, Lords, I hope the lakes of Bretonnia run clear this day. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_EMP_Genrl1_Dip_Bret_Greet_Neu_02	So what can the Empire do, that the mighty flower of Bretonnia cannot? 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_EMP_Genrl1_Dip_Bret_Greet_Pos_01	Greeting neighbours, how fair the lands beyond the Grey Mountains?  	false
diplomacy_strings_string_EMP_Genrl1_Dip_Bret_Greet_Pos_02	Honourable Knights come to parley with the Empire on this fine Aubentag.  	false
diplomacy_strings_string_EMP_Genrl1_Dip_Bretonnia_Acceptance_Negative_01	Yes, we will aid as we always do when you come crying for the mother's milk of the Empire. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_EMP_Genrl1_Dip_Bretonnia_Acceptance_Negative_02	Very well, we have an agreement. Do not betray us, "noble" Knights, you are not fooling anyone with your claims of chivalry.  	false
diplomacy_strings_string_EMP_Genrl1_Dip_Bretonnia_Acceptance_Neutral_01	We will work together. You'll have to get over your disdain for black powder! 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_EMP_Genrl1_Dip_Bretonnia_Acceptance_Neutral_02	I accept the terms - on the acknowledgement that our Knights are superior to yours, of course. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_EMP_Genrl1_Dip_Bretonnia_Acceptance_Positive_01	We will sign a treaty and toast our king and emperor! 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_EMP_Genrl1_Dip_Bretonnia_Acceptance_Positive_02	Man allies with man - there is hope for the Old World yet! 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_EMP_Genrl1_Dip_Bretonnia_Rejection_Negative_01	No - at least with the Orcs, you know what you are getting. I despise Bretonnians because you are weasels in armour!	false
diplomacy_strings_string_EMP_Genrl1_Dip_Bretonnia_Rejection_Negative_02	Get from thee, messenger, I have no patience for the bumpkins of that festering hole you call a country today. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_EMP_Genrl1_Dip_Bretonnia_Rejection_Neutral_01	I'm afraid you'll have to cope without "unchivalrous" allies like us.  	false
diplomacy_strings_string_EMP_Genrl1_Dip_Bretonnia_Rejection_Neutral_02	Go then, return to your king with a tale of Empire "greed".	false
diplomacy_strings_string_EMP_Genrl1_Dip_Bretonnia_Rejection_Positive_01	Unfortunately not, we cannot aid fair Bretonnia this time. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_EMP_Genrl1_Dip_Bretonnia_Rejection_Positive_02	It is with regret we cannot aid you, the Empire looks to troubles elsewhere. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_EMP_Genrl1_Dip_Chaos_Acceptance_Negative_01	Agreed, but I pray to Ulric that his wolves will guard against Chaos betrayal! 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_EMP_Genrl1_Dip_Chaos_Acceptance_Negative_02	My hand is forced, we have been coerced by agents of Chaos to accept! The Emperor will not forget this! 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_EMP_Genrl1_Dip_Chaos_Acceptance_Neutral_01	It chills me to my bones, but for the good of the Empire, yes. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_EMP_Genrl1_Dip_Chaos_Acceptance_Neutral_02	We have an agreement - tell your masters that they must claim no souls in recompense! 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_EMP_Genrl1_Dip_Chaos_Acceptance_Positive_01	We will work together for now, minion of Chaos. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_EMP_Genrl1_Dip_Chaos_Acceptance_Positive_02	There is a common cause, but do not underestimate brave hearts of Empire men, Chaos worm.  	false
diplomacy_strings_string_EMP_Genrl1_Dip_Chaos_Greet_Neg_01	The bastards of Chaos are here to treat, I invoke the protection of Sigmar! 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_EMP_Genrl1_Dip_Chaos_Greet_Neg_02	What comes slithering along the ground? A serpent in thrall to repulsive Gods! 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_EMP_Genrl1_Dip_Chaos_Greet_Neu_01	Speak no lies, Chaos filth, for I will know them… 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_EMP_Genrl1_Dip_Chaos_Greet_Neu_02	You have a message from your despicable masters, Northman? 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_EMP_Genrl1_Dip_Chaos_Greet_Pos_01	The thought disgusts me, but I will hear you, agent of Chaos… 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_EMP_Genrl1_Dip_Chaos_Greet_Pos_02	Speak then, Northman, let us hear your lies. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_EMP_Genrl1_Dip_Chaos_Rejection_Negative_01	Never, Chaos scum, tell me why the Greatswords shouldn't slay you on the spot! 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_EMP_Genrl1_Dip_Chaos_Rejection_Negative_02	By Sigmar! As long as there is breath in my body I will never agree to such a thing! 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_EMP_Genrl1_Dip_Chaos_Rejection_Neutral_01	I should take your tongue so you can speak no more lies, vile spawn! 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_EMP_Genrl1_Dip_Chaos_Rejection_Neutral_02	You are nothing more than a servile thing in thrall to Chaos. I deny you. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_EMP_Genrl1_Dip_Chaos_Rejection_Positive_01	You are our mortal enemy, the Empire could never work with you. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_EMP_Genrl1_Dip_Chaos_Rejection_Positive_02	Do you think me corrupted by your foul masters? Why would I seek a pact with invaders? 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_EMP_Genrl1_Dip_Dwarf_Acceptance_Negative_01	You drive a hard bargain at the Empire's expense, Dwarf. I will not forget this! 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_EMP_Genrl1_Dip_Dwarf_Acceptance_Negative_02	Very well, although I see no Dwarfs helping the Empire's families. You're certainly eager to take our coin though! 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_EMP_Genrl1_Dip_Dwarf_Acceptance_Neutral_01	We have an agreement - let us drink to another alliance! 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_EMP_Genrl1_Dip_Dwarf_Acceptance_Neutral_02	The contracts are signed, the terms settled, so please no more grumbling!	false
diplomacy_strings_string_EMP_Genrl1_Dip_Dwarf_Acceptance_Positive_01	Yes, just as in the times of old! 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_EMP_Genrl1_Dip_Dwarf_Acceptance_Positive_02	Of course we shall work with you, for it has ever been that way! 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_EMP_Genrl1_Dip_Dwarf_Rejection_Negative_01	No! You have always looked down your beards at us, but whose Empire lies in ruins? 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_EMP_Genrl1_Dip_Dwarf_Rejection_Negative_02	Dwarf! Insult us again, and you will see how accurate my handgunners truly are! 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_EMP_Genrl1_Dip_Dwarf_Rejection_Neutral_01	The terms are all in your favour! I will not agree, Dwarf, I do not fear your High King's wrath! 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_EMP_Genrl1_Dip_Dwarf_Rejection_Neutral_02	Come now, you do not negotiate with some callow youth. I cannot - will not - accept this, even from a Dwarf!  	false
diplomacy_strings_string_EMP_Genrl1_Dip_Dwarf_Rejection_Positive_01	The Elector Counts will not permit this pact with the Dwarfs.  	false
diplomacy_strings_string_EMP_Genrl1_Dip_Dwarf_Rejection_Positive_02	An agreement! Let us drink Dwarfish brew to celebrate! 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_EMP_Genrl1_Dip_Dwf_Greet_Neg_01	And so come the Dwarfs – late as usual – to sour my day!	false
diplomacy_strings_string_EMP_Genrl1_Dip_Dwf_Greet_Neg_02	Make your demands then, Dwarfs, but don't expect the Empire to concede. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_EMP_Genrl1_Dip_Dwf_Greet_Neu_01	Well met, Dwarfs, what are your demands? I hope you will be more accommodating than usual.  	false
diplomacy_strings_string_EMP_Genrl1_Dip_Dwf_Greet_Neu_02	Dwarfs, I hope we can strike some petty grievances from that book you hold so dear. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_EMP_Genrl1_Dip_Dwf_Greet_Pos_01	Welcome, ancient allies. In these troubled times Dwarfs are a fine sight to behold!   	false
diplomacy_strings_string_EMP_Genrl1_Dip_Dwf_Greet_Pos_02	The Dwarfs have come, I hope they have brought a few barrels of Bugman's with them. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_EMP_Genrl1_Dip_Empire_Acceptance_Negative_01	Although it gulls to work with your petty province, I will for now. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_EMP_Genrl1_Dip_Empire_Acceptance_Negative_02	Very well, but I find you as trustworthy as a band of Marienburgers! 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_EMP_Genrl1_Dip_Empire_Acceptance_Neutral_01	I endorse this - together our nation is stronger! 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_EMP_Genrl1_Dip_Empire_Acceptance_Neutral_02	Yes, for the good of all the provinces we will do this. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_EMP_Genrl1_Dip_Empire_Acceptance_Positive_01	We should feast to this grand accord! Is it Festag yet? 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_EMP_Genrl1_Dip_Empire_Acceptance_Positive_02	Of course, I accept. How could I not when it is my fellow countrymen who ask? 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_EMP_Genrl1_Dip_Empire_Greet_Neg_01	You dare come at me making demands? Call yourself men of the Empire?! 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_EMP_Genrl1_Dip_Empire_Greet_Neg_02	Why talk to you? The Grand Theogonist should declare you traitors and heretics! 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_EMP_Genrl1_Dip_Empire_Greet_Neu_01	Greetings my countrymen, do you come in peace on this fine Marktag? 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_EMP_Genrl1_Dip_Empire_Greet_Neu_02	Surely an agreement will be reached, for are we all not sons of Sigmar? 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_EMP_Genrl1_Dip_Empire_Greet_Pos_01	Welcome, my countrymen! 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_EMP_Genrl1_Dip_Empire_Greet_Pos_02	It is good to see fellow sons of the Empire this day! 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_EMP_Genrl1_Dip_Empire_Rejection_Negative_01	No, traitors, you do not dictate terms to me! 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_EMP_Genrl1_Dip_Empire_Rejection_Negative_02	No, and a pox on your province for even asking such a thing! 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_EMP_Genrl1_Dip_Empire_Rejection_Neutral_01	Not this day, I'm afraid, your demands are too much. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_EMP_Genrl1_Dip_Empire_Rejection_Neutral_02	My heart is saddened when countrymen such as ourselves cannot make common cause. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_EMP_Genrl1_Dip_Empire_Rejection_Positive_01	Alas, I have my orders and you have yours. We could not make this work… 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_EMP_Genrl1_Dip_Empire_Rejection_Positive_02	No, not with Morrslieb so low in the sky - dark omens… 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_EMP_Genrl1_Dip_Greenskin_Acceptance_Negative_01	May Sigmar forgive me for working with his greatest foe… 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_EMP_Genrl1_Dip_Greenskin_Acceptance_Negative_02	We must accept, Orc, but our swords will remain at your green throat! 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_EMP_Genrl1_Dip_Greenskin_Acceptance_Neutral_01	An uneasy pact - but one that might work if the green scum can keep their word. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_EMP_Genrl1_Dip_Greenskin_Acceptance_Neutral_02	I look to the Goddess Verena for her wisdom in this pact with the Greenskin daemons. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_EMP_Genrl1_Dip_Greenskin_Acceptance_Positive_01	It is not something I have heard of in many generations, but there is a precedent… 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_EMP_Genrl1_Dip_Greenskin_Acceptance_Positive_02	Prove to me then, Greenskin, that you can keep your word… I remain sceptical. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_EMP_Genrl1_Dip_Greenskin_Rejection_Negative_01	Greenskins… you are a curse upon the world, a blight on the land, and we will wipe you out!	false
diplomacy_strings_string_EMP_Genrl1_Dip_Greenskin_Rejection_Negative_02	I don't know who I hate more... the great green beasts or those little bastards who follow them about. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_EMP_Genrl1_Dip_Greenskin_Rejection_Neutral_01	I don't think so, Greenskin. The Empire will never ally with beasts!  	false
diplomacy_strings_string_EMP_Genrl1_Dip_Greenskin_Rejection_Neutral_02	The concept would be laughable if the thought wasn't so disgusting. The answer is no! 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_EMP_Genrl1_Dip_Greenskin_Rejection_Positive_01	Not this time, if ever. Tell your Warboss he is beyond dim, even for your kind.   	false
diplomacy_strings_string_EMP_Genrl1_Dip_Greenskin_Rejection_Positive_02	You'd have me the jest of every noble court in the Empire. I don't think so.	false
diplomacy_strings_string_EMP_Genrl1_Dip_Greet_Neg_01	Do not waste my time with petty talk, make your offer and be done! 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_EMP_Genrl1_Dip_Greet_Neg_02	Deliver your missive and then get from my presence. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_EMP_Genrl1_Dip_Greet_Neg_03	My hand hovers close to my blade, utter your demand before I raise it! 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_EMP_Genrl1_Dip_Greet_Neu_01	I will listen, but my time is short… 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_EMP_Genrl1_Dip_Greet_Neu_02	Approach and make your offer, but I make no promises to my assent. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_EMP_Genrl1_Dip_Greet_Neu_03	Greetings on behalf of the Empire, now what brings you with here with a sheathed blade? 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_EMP_Genrl1_Dip_Greet_Pos_01	By Sigmar's will, come in peace. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_EMP_Genrl1_Dip_Greet_Pos_02	Approach as friend and make your offer. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_EMP_Genrl1_Dip_Greet_Pos_03	Come then, only Sigmar's God, Ulric, can judge it worthy or no. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_EMP_Genrl1_Dip_Grskn_Greet_Neg_01	Orcs come before me with a proposal. I am duty bound to listen, but my arm aches to strike them down.  	false
diplomacy_strings_string_EMP_Genrl1_Dip_Grskn_Greet_Neg_02	Speak then, Greenskin, but know that the Empire does not willingly treat with your vile kind. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_EMP_Genrl1_Dip_Grskn_Greet_Neu_01	Do not expect me to welcome you, Orc, if you can talk then say what you must. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_EMP_Genrl1_Dip_Grskn_Greet_Neu_02	I will be pragmatic, and treat with the Orcs, if it delays them from attacking. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_EMP_Genrl1_Dip_Grskn_Greet_Pos_01	The Orcs have come to talk? This should be amusing… 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_EMP_Genrl1_Dip_Grskn_Greet_Pos_02	I am both intrigued and suspicious, what could the Greenskins want from us? 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_EMP_Genrl1_Dip_Rejection_Negative_01	I will not accept this - not for all the gold in Marienburg! 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_EMP_Genrl1_Dip_Rejection_Negative_02	Get away! Before I have a Battle Wizard burn you alive! 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_EMP_Genrl1_Dip_Rejection_Negative_03	You are a painted fool if you think I'd betray my nation by agreeing to this vile plan!	false
diplomacy_strings_string_EMP_Genrl1_Dip_Rejection_Neutral_01	No, thank the gods, I do not have the authority for such a thing. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_EMP_Genrl1_Dip_Rejection_Neutral_02	You rush me to an answer and that has cost you dear! 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_EMP_Genrl1_Dip_Rejection_Neutral_03	There is no advantage for the Empire in this. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_EMP_Genrl1_Dip_Rejection_Positive_01	No, not this time. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_EMP_Genrl1_Dip_Rejection_Positive_02	Alas, I must refuse your offer. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_EMP_Genrl1_Dip_Rejection_Positive_03	Do not take offense at my refusal, Morrslieb hangs low in the sky so the omens are ill. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_EMP_Genrl1_Dip_Vamp_Greet_Neg_01	I will not parley with the dead! Be gone, abomination! 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_EMP_Genrl1_Dip_Vamp_Greet_Neg_02	Von Carstein! A curse upon the Empire for centuries, what do you want, creature?  	false
diplomacy_strings_string_EMP_Genrl1_Dip_Vamp_Greet_Neu_01	A minion of von Carstein dares to come before me… 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_EMP_Genrl1_Dip_Vamp_Greet_Neu_02	I'll hear words from that Unliving throat, but I make no promises that I won't draw my sword.	false
diplomacy_strings_string_EMP_Genrl1_Dip_Vamp_Greet_Pos_01	Dark days indeed, when Vampires come to pay social calls. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_EMP_Genrl1_Dip_Vamp_Greet_Pos_02	You may deliver your message, abomination.	false
diplomacy_strings_string_EMP_Genrl1_Dip_Vampire_Acceptance_Negative_01	May Morr forgive me, but I agree. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_EMP_Genrl1_Dip_Vampire_Acceptance_Negative_02	You leave me no choice, Undead beast. I agree to the pact, but it makes me sick in the gut to say so. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_EMP_Genrl1_Dip_Vampire_Acceptance_Neutral_01	Sigmar cannot look upon me with favour for this, but I must agree. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_EMP_Genrl1_Dip_Vampire_Acceptance_Neutral_02	So be it, but I do not like this. Do not look me in the eye again, Vampire! 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_EMP_Genrl1_Dip_Vampire_Acceptance_Positive_01	I won't deny that this is a strange treaty, but it must be done. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_EMP_Genrl1_Dip_Vampire_Acceptance_Positive_02	Very well, Undead monster, we will see if this works fair or foul for the Empire. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_EMP_Genrl1_Dip_Vampire_Rejection_Negative_01	Never! Not even if Franz ordered me to himself! 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_EMP_Genrl1_Dip_Vampire_Rejection_Negative_02	Get out of my sight, creature! Tell your masters the Empire will never ally with such blasphemies! 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_EMP_Genrl1_Dip_Vampire_Rejection_Neutral_01	If you utter one more sound I'll have the Light Wizard banish you from this realm!	false
diplomacy_strings_string_EMP_Genrl1_Dip_Vampire_Rejection_Neutral_02	No, you should never have left Morr's embrace! 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_EMP_Genrl1_Dip_Vampire_Rejection_Positive_01	I could not make peace with Morr if I were to ally with these creatures. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_EMP_Genrl1_Dip_Vampire_Rejection_Positive_02	No - there is no pact with Vampires this day! 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_EMP_Genrl2_Dip_Bret_Greet_Neg_01	It is late in the day for Bretonnia to come running on their ponies demanding aid. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_EMP_Genrl2_Dip_Bret_Greet_Neg_02	Here come the embodiment of mounted arrogance, the Bretonnian Knights! 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_EMP_Genrl2_Dip_Bret_Greet_Neu_01	Greetings, Lords, I hope the lakes of Bretonnia run clear this day. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_EMP_Genrl2_Dip_Bret_Greet_Neu_02	So what can the Empire do, that the mighty flower of Bretonnia cannot? 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_EMP_Genrl2_Dip_Bret_Greet_Pos_01	Greeting neighbours, how fair the lands beyond the Grey Mountains?  	false
diplomacy_strings_string_EMP_Genrl2_Dip_Bret_Greet_Pos_02	Honourable Knights come to parley with the Empire on this fine Aubentag.  	false
diplomacy_strings_string_EMP_Genrl2_Dip_Chaos_Greet_Neg_01	The creatures of Chaos are here to treat, I invoke the protection of Sigmar! 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_EMP_Genrl2_Dip_Chaos_Greet_Neg_02	What comes slithering along the ground? A serpent in thrall to repulsive Gods! 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_EMP_Genrl2_Dip_Chaos_Greet_Neu_01	Speak no lies, Chaos filth, for I will know them… 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_EMP_Genrl2_Dip_Chaos_Greet_Neu_02	You have a message from your despicable masters, Northman? 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_EMP_Genrl2_Dip_Chaos_Greet_Pos_01	The thought disgusts me, but I will hear you, agent of Chaos… 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_EMP_Genrl2_Dip_Chaos_Greet_Pos_02	Speak then, Northman, let us hear your lies. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_EMP_Genrl2_Dip_Dwf_Greet_Neg_01	And so come the Dwarfs – late as usual – to sour my day!	false
diplomacy_strings_string_EMP_Genrl2_Dip_Dwf_Greet_Neg_02	Make your demands then, Dwarfs, but don't expect the Empire to concede. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_EMP_Genrl2_Dip_Dwf_Greet_Neu_01	Well met, Dwarfs, what are your demands? I hope you will be more accommodating than usual.  	false
diplomacy_strings_string_EMP_Genrl2_Dip_Dwf_Greet_Neu_02	Dwarfs, I hope we can strike some petty grievances from that book you hold so dear. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_EMP_Genrl2_Dip_Dwf_Greet_Pos_01	Welcome, ancient allies. In these troubled times Dwarfs are a fine sight to behold!   	false
diplomacy_strings_string_EMP_Genrl2_Dip_Dwf_Greet_Pos_02	The Dwarfs have come, I hope they have brought a few barrels of Bugman's with them. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_EMP_Genrl2_Dip_Empire_Greet_Neg_01	You dare come at me making demands? Call yourself men of the Empire?! 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_EMP_Genrl2_Dip_Empire_Greet_Neg_02	Why talk to you? The Grand Theogonist should declare you traitors and heretics! 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_EMP_Genrl2_Dip_Empire_Greet_Neu_01	Greetings my countrymen, do you come in peace on this fine Marktag? 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_EMP_Genrl2_Dip_Empire_Greet_Neu_02	Surely an agreement will be reached, for are we all not sons of Sigmar? 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_EMP_Genrl2_Dip_Empire_Greet_Pos_01	Welcome, my countrymen! 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_EMP_Genrl2_Dip_Empire_Greet_Pos_02	It is good to see fellow sons of the Empire this day! 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_EMP_Genrl2_Dip_Greet_Neg_01	Do not waste my time with petty talk, make your offer and be done! 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_EMP_Genrl2_Dip_Greet_Neg_02	Deliver your missive and then get from my presence. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_EMP_Genrl2_Dip_Greet_Neg_03	My hand hovers close to my blade, utter your demand before I raise it! 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_EMP_Genrl2_Dip_Greet_Neu_01	I will listen, but my time is short… 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_EMP_Genrl2_Dip_Greet_Neu_02	Approach and make your offer, but I make no promises to my assent. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_EMP_Genrl2_Dip_Greet_Neu_03	Greetings on behalf of the Empire, now what brings you with here with a sheathed blade? 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_EMP_Genrl2_Dip_Greet_Pos_01	By Sigmar's will, come in peace. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_EMP_Genrl2_Dip_Greet_Pos_02	Approach as friend and make your offer. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_EMP_Genrl2_Dip_Greet_Pos_03	Come then, only Sigmar's God, Ulric, can judge it worthy or no. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_EMP_Genrl2_Dip_Grskn_Greet_Neg_01	Orcs come before me with a proposal. I am duty bound to listen, but my arm aches to strike them down.  	false
diplomacy_strings_string_EMP_Genrl2_Dip_Grskn_Greet_Neg_02	Speak then, Greenskin, but know that the Empire does not willingly treat with your vile kind. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_EMP_Genrl2_Dip_Grskn_Greet_Neu_01	Do not expect me to welcome you, Orc, if you can talk then say what you must. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_EMP_Genrl2_Dip_Grskn_Greet_Neu_02	I will be pragmatic and treat with the Orcs, if it delays them from attacking.  	false
diplomacy_strings_string_EMP_Genrl2_Dip_Grskn_Greet_Pos_01	The Orcs have come to talk? This should be amusing… 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_EMP_Genrl2_Dip_Grskn_Greet_Pos_02	I am both intrigued and suspicious, what could the Greenskins want from us? 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_EMP_Genrl2_Dip_Vamp_Greet_Neg_01	I will not parley with the dead! Be gone, abomination! 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_EMP_Genrl2_Dip_Vamp_Greet_Neg_02	Von Carstein! A curse upon the Empire for centuries, what do you want, creature?  	false
diplomacy_strings_string_EMP_Genrl2_Dip_Vamp_Greet_Neu_01	An abomination of Morr dares to come before me… 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_EMP_Genrl2_Dip_Vamp_Greet_Neu_02	I'll hear words from that Unliving throat, but I make no promises that I won't draw my sword.	false
diplomacy_strings_string_EMP_Genrl2_Dip_Vamp_Greet_Pos_01	Dark days indeed, when Vampires come to pay social calls. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_EMP_Genrl2_Dip_Vamp_Greet_Pos_02	You may deliver your message, abomination.	false
diplomacy_strings_string_EMP_KF_Dip_Acceptance_Negative_01	As a means to an end, I must agree.	false
diplomacy_strings_string_EMP_KF_Dip_Acceptance_Negative_02	It pains me and this grand office to do so, but yes. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_EMP_KF_Dip_Acceptance_Negative_03	We have an accord, but I warn you - betraying the Empire will be a fatal mistake. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_EMP_KF_Dip_Acceptance_Neutral_01	Very well. Get the papers written so I may set the Silver Seal upon them. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_EMP_KF_Dip_Acceptance_Neutral_02	A pledge for our mutual benefit then. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_EMP_KF_Dip_Acceptance_Neutral_03	This is the most sensible course. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_EMP_KF_Dip_Acceptance_Positive_01	We have a treaty! 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_EMP_KF_Dip_Acceptance_Positive_02	I consider you an ally in these dark times. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_EMP_KF_Dip_Acceptance_Positive_03	A welcome alliance! 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_EMP_KF_Dip_Bret_Greet_Neg_01	Your appearance is inopportune, Knight, but I will hear you out. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_EMP_KF_Dip_Bret_Greet_Neg_02	Come then, approach Sigmar's throne and bark your message from Leoncoeur. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_EMP_KF_Dip_Bret_Greet_Neu_01	Come before me, envoys of Bretonnia. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_EMP_KF_Dip_Bret_Greet_Neu_02	Your king sends brave men to approach me this Hexenstag!  	false
diplomacy_strings_string_EMP_KF_Dip_Bret_Greet_Pos_01	Welcome, brothers from across the Grey Mountains.  	false
diplomacy_strings_string_EMP_KF_Dip_Bret_Greet_Pos_02	Hail to Leoncoeur, how can the Empire aid you in such evil times? 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_EMP_KF_Dip_Bretonnia_Acceptance_Negative_01	You have forced me into this pact. But it's not to my liking! 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_EMP_KF_Dip_Bretonnia_Acceptance_Negative_02	We have common cause, but do not mistake this for friendship, boy!	false
diplomacy_strings_string_EMP_KF_Dip_Bretonnia_Acceptance_Neutral_01	We have an agreement, only together can we push back the forces of destruction. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_EMP_KF_Dip_Bretonnia_Acceptance_Neutral_02	Agreed, our Knights will march in step with your own.	false
diplomacy_strings_string_EMP_KF_Dip_Bretonnia_Acceptance_Positive_01	An alliance of men - the Old World needs such treaties. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_EMP_KF_Dip_Bretonnia_Acceptance_Positive_02	Our Bretonnian cousins will stand with us against the darkness! 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_EMP_KF_Dip_Bretonnia_Rejection_Negative_01	I have no time and little love for Bretonnian beggars right now! 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_EMP_KF_Dip_Bretonnia_Rejection_Negative_02	Your king is as impotent as a Bretonnian cannon! Now go! 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_EMP_KF_Dip_Bretonnia_Rejection_Neutral_01	Tell your dukes I must dismiss this out of hand.	false
diplomacy_strings_string_EMP_KF_Dip_Bretonnia_Rejection_Neutral_02	You have not always been friends of the Empire, Bretonnian, and I regret to say this at such a time. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_EMP_KF_Dip_Bretonnia_Rejection_Positive_01	Return to your king and tell him that on this occasion we cannot agree.	false
diplomacy_strings_string_EMP_KF_Dip_Bretonnia_Rejection_Positive_02	Bretonnia and the Empire will take to the battlefield once more… but not this day. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_EMP_KF_Dip_Chaos_Acceptance_Negative_01	Agreed… I can only hope that one day Sigmar will forgive me for this! 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_EMP_KF_Dip_Chaos_Acceptance_Negative_02	I make the ultimate sacrifice - the Empire must align with the Dark Gods. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_EMP_KF_Dip_Chaos_Acceptance_Neutral_01	Strike this meeting from the chronicles! I will not have the shame of this treaty mentioned in the scrolls!  	false
diplomacy_strings_string_EMP_KF_Dip_Chaos_Acceptance_Neutral_02	Agreed, but I pray to Shallya that I will not regret such a pact. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_EMP_KF_Dip_Chaos_Acceptance_Positive_01	It is a fell pact I make, but one that must be done. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_EMP_KF_Dip_Chaos_Acceptance_Positive_02	You have my attention, but don't mistake this temporary alliance as complicity in your masters' designs. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_EMP_KF_Dip_Chaos_Greet_Neg_01	Chaos! The fact you are even stood before me is an affront to my country! 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_EMP_KF_Dip_Chaos_Greet_Neg_02	I have done dark deeds in my time as the Emperor, but never would I willingly entertain an agent of the Ruinous Powers! 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_EMP_KF_Dip_Chaos_Greet_Neu_01	Do not test my patience, Northman. Say what you must then get out. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_EMP_KF_Dip_Chaos_Greet_Neu_02	Chaos! The fact you are even stood before me is an affront to my country! 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_EMP_KF_Dip_Chaos_Greet_Pos_01	The days must be fraught, when peons of Chaos deign to parley with me! 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_EMP_KF_Dip_Chaos_Greet_Pos_02	I will not welcome you, raider, but make your offer. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_EMP_KF_Dip_Chaos_Rejection_Negative_01	Never! Not in my reign or the next, be gone maggot of Chaos, putrid scum of impotent Gods! 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_EMP_KF_Dip_Chaos_Rejection_Negative_02	Get this Chaos filth out of my sight - tell your Gods the Empire will never submit to their despicable rule. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_EMP_KF_Dip_Chaos_Rejection_Neutral_01	Whether it's in Reikspiel or your own foul language, Sorcerer, the answer is no.   	false
diplomacy_strings_string_EMP_KF_Dip_Chaos_Rejection_Neutral_02	Be gone, spawn, tell your masters I am not their puppet! 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_EMP_KF_Dip_Chaos_Rejection_Positive_01	I would rather Todbringer take the mantle of Emperor than have a pact with you!  	false
diplomacy_strings_string_EMP_KF_Dip_Chaos_Rejection_Positive_02	One of my titles is Defiler of the Dark. How could I claim such if I allied with Chaos filth! 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_EMP_KF_Dip_Dwarf_Acceptance_Negative_01	We will join again, but remember you need the Empire more than we need Grudgebearer. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_EMP_KF_Dip_Dwarf_Acceptance_Negative_02	Agreed, although I find your tone grating, Dwarf-friend. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_EMP_KF_Dip_Dwarf_Acceptance_Neutral_01	We have an accord to make our ancestors proud. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_EMP_KF_Dip_Dwarf_Acceptance_Neutral_02	Agreed, but do not mistake this for obedience, Dwarf.  	false
diplomacy_strings_string_EMP_KF_Dip_Dwarf_Acceptance_Positive_01	As Sigmar did, so we ally with the Dwarfs. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_EMP_KF_Dip_Dwarf_Acceptance_Positive_02	Of course, the Empire has ever been in your debt. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_EMP_KF_Dip_Dwarf_Rejection_Negative_01	No! I will not be lectured to by Dwarfs when your kingdom diminishes before my eyes! 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_EMP_KF_Dip_Dwarf_Rejection_Negative_02	Not this time, the old alliance has long since passed. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_EMP_KF_Dip_Dwarf_Rejection_Neutral_01	No, the Empire cannot help you this time, you are on your own, Dwarfs.  	false
diplomacy_strings_string_EMP_KF_Dip_Dwarf_Rejection_Neutral_02	Unfortunately I must refuse, Grimnir's kin. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_EMP_KF_Dip_Dwarf_Rejection_Positive_01	Forgers of Ghal Maraz - it is with great regret that I cannot agree to this endeavour. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_EMP_KF_Dip_Dwarf_Rejection_Positive_02	Sadly, not this day, honourable Dwarfs. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_EMP_KF_Dip_Dwf_Greet_Neg_01	Approach me Dwarf, but do not expect alliances to be reignited on history alone. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_EMP_KF_Dip_Dwf_Greet_Neg_02	You come for favours but all I hear is scorn – always the Dwarfs come to scold us!	false
diplomacy_strings_string_EMP_KF_Dip_Dwf_Greet_Neu_01	How fares the Karaz Ankor in these dark times? 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_EMP_KF_Dip_Dwf_Greet_Neu_02	You approach us in difficult days, Dwarf. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_EMP_KF_Dip_Dwf_Greet_Pos_01	Welcome, oldest friends of the Empire!	false
diplomacy_strings_string_EMP_KF_Dip_Dwf_Greet_Pos_02	It is good to see our allies of the mountains. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_EMP_KF_Dip_Emp_Greet_Neg_01	Bow before your Emperor! 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_EMP_KF_Dip_Emp_Greet_Neg_02	You come before me as arrogant fools, refusing union weakens us all!  	false
diplomacy_strings_string_EMP_KF_Dip_Emp_Greet_Neu_01	I hold Ghal Maraz, you may bow. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_EMP_KF_Dip_Emp_Greet_Neu_02	Greetings countrymen, I welcome your offer. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_EMP_KF_Dip_Emp_Greet_Pos_01	Greetings, fellow heirs of Sigmar! 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_EMP_KF_Dip_Emp_Greet_Pos_02	I am Karl Franz, many call me Emperor… 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_EMP_KF_Dip_Empire_Acceptance_Negative_01	Very well, but I will reunite these lands despite you. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_EMP_KF_Dip_Empire_Acceptance_Negative_02	An accord it is, but Sigmar weeps until we are as one! 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_EMP_KF_Dip_Empire_Acceptance_Neutral_01	Agreed, but soon you must return fully to Imperial rule. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_EMP_KF_Dip_Empire_Acceptance_Neutral_02	Yes, you have your Emperor's accent. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_EMP_KF_Dip_Empire_Acceptance_Positive_01	Of course, together we are stronger! 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_EMP_KF_Dip_Empire_Acceptance_Positive_02	My seal will be upon the treaty. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_EMP_KF_Dip_Empire_Rejection_Negative_01	I will not condone such a travesty. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_EMP_KF_Dip_Empire_Rejection_Negative_02	A notion from petty fools who refuse my legitimate rule! 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_EMP_KF_Dip_Empire_Rejection_Neutral_01	No, now return to the bosom of Imperial decree. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_EMP_KF_Dip_Empire_Rejection_Neutral_02	There will be no agreement from me, secessionists! 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_EMP_KF_Dip_Empire_Rejection_Positive_01	I'm afraid not, I must consider the whole nation. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_EMP_KF_Dip_Empire_Rejection_Positive_02	I have consulted with the Arch-Lectors - the answer is no, but go in peace. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_EMP_KF_Dip_Greenskin_Acceptance_Negative_01	This a measure of the age we live in, when I am forced to ally with accursed Orcs! 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_EMP_KF_Dip_Greenskin_Acceptance_Negative_02	Do not test my resolve, Orc. If we agree this pact, I can be magnanimous in victory but also your worst nightmare!  	false
diplomacy_strings_string_EMP_KF_Dip_Greenskin_Acceptance_Neutral_01	Against my advisors wishes we have an accord then, Orc.  	false
diplomacy_strings_string_EMP_KF_Dip_Greenskin_Acceptance_Neutral_02	Sigmar preserve my crown! For I cavort with Orcs! 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_EMP_KF_Dip_Greenskin_Acceptance_Positive_01	A strange circumstance that we must work with Greenskins. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_EMP_KF_Dip_Greenskin_Acceptance_Positive_02	Sigmar preserve me! But I am forced to agree with the beasts. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_EMP_KF_Dip_Greenskin_Rejection_Negative_01	Summon Schwarzhelm! I would have this Greenskin slain where it stands for such insolence! 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_EMP_KF_Dip_Greenskin_Rejection_Negative_02	You are ancient enemies of Sigmar, of the Empire! We could never have a pact! 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_EMP_KF_Dip_Greenskin_Rejection_Neutral_01	I reject your offer Greenskin. As would any in my office! 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_EMP_KF_Dip_Greenskin_Rejection_Neutral_02	No - to work with the Greenskins is to ally with our oldest foe! 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_EMP_KF_Dip_Greenskin_Rejection_Positive_01	Get out, Orc! Even Emperor Ludwig the Fat never considered allying with Greenskins.  	false
diplomacy_strings_string_EMP_KF_Dip_Greenskin_Rejection_Positive_02	To even ask such a thing is to mock my sovereignty! 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_EMP_KF_Dip_Greet_Neg_01	You are not welcome in my court, and yet here you are. Friend or foe? We will see… 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_EMP_KF_Dip_Greet_Neg_02	Speak, I will hear you now! Be warned, my mood is dark. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_EMP_KF_Dip_Greet_Neg_03	I will hear your petition, but make no promises to act on it.  	false
diplomacy_strings_string_EMP_KF_Dip_Greet_Neu_01	Greetings, all you survey are loyal to me, so I advise caution with your next words. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_EMP_KF_Dip_Greet_Neu_02	I will hear what you have to say. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_EMP_KF_Dip_Greet_Neu_03	The Celestial College implores that I hear you, I remain unconvinced…  	false
diplomacy_strings_string_EMP_KF_Dip_Greet_Pos_01	Friends of the Empire, come! 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_EMP_KF_Dip_Greet_Pos_02	Greetings from Sigmar… 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_EMP_KF_Dip_Greet_Pos_03	Be at peace, for that is all I ever want.  	false
diplomacy_strings_string_EMP_KF_Dip_Grskn_Greet_Neg_01	Orc scum! You dare to presume by coming before me! 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_EMP_KF_Dip_Grskn_Greet_Neg_02	Orcs come before me! Be careful what you say, beast, or my Reiksmarshal will have your tongue! 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_EMP_KF_Dip_Grskn_Greet_Neu_01	Orc, you have me attention, issue your demands, but be quick! 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_EMP_KF_Dip_Grskn_Greet_Neu_02	What could possible warrant the Greenskins to prostrate themselves before me? 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_EMP_KF_Dip_Grskn_Greet_Pos_01	Fine! I will talk to the beasts, its makes a refreshing change to slaying them! 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_EMP_KF_Dip_Grskn_Greet_Pos_02	Come then, Orc, I'll hear your offer. Can you even speak Reikspiel? 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_EMP_KF_Dip_Rejection_Negative_01	No, do not darken this throne again.	false
diplomacy_strings_string_EMP_KF_Dip_Rejection_Negative_02	I should strike you down with Heldenhammer's wrath! 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_EMP_KF_Dip_Rejection_Negative_03	Leave now! Before I have the Reiksguard send your head into the river!	false
diplomacy_strings_string_EMP_KF_Dip_Rejection_Neutral_01	No, we will stand on our own! 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_EMP_KF_Dip_Rejection_Neutral_02	I will not bind my nation to these terms!	false
diplomacy_strings_string_EMP_KF_Dip_Rejection_Neutral_03	I refuse. Do not question this, I am Emperor!  	false
diplomacy_strings_string_EMP_KF_Dip_Rejection_Positive_01	I regret that we cannot agree terms. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_EMP_KF_Dip_Rejection_Positive_02	Let us try again, some day, perhaps when the Twin-tailed Comet appears in the sky?	false
diplomacy_strings_string_EMP_KF_Dip_Rejection_Positive_03	I'm sorry, my advisors are against this. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_EMP_KF_Dip_Vamp_Greet_Neg_01	You dare approach me, vile beasts? 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_EMP_KF_Dip_Vamp_Greet_Neg_02	Von Carstein sends his minions to threaten and parley?! 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_EMP_KF_Dip_Vamp_Greet_Neu_01	You are no Lord of the Empire, Vampire to even dress as such is a grave insult! 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_EMP_KF_Dip_Vamp_Greet_Neu_02	Let the thing deliver its vile message. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_EMP_KF_Dip_Vamp_Greet_Pos_01	Vampire… speak before I summon the Witch Hunters. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_EMP_KF_Dip_Vamp_Greet_Pos_02	What have you to say, monster?	false
diplomacy_strings_string_EMP_KF_Dip_Vampire_Acceptance_Negative_01	Morr forgive me… but yes. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_EMP_KF_Dip_Vampire_Acceptance_Negative_02	Agreed, but never forget, sorcerer, that I can unmake you! 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_EMP_KF_Dip_Vampire_Acceptance_Neutral_01	Understand - I do this only because I must, von Carstein. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_EMP_KF_Dip_Vampire_Acceptance_Neutral_02	Agreed, I can only pray that Sigmar will forgive me for such a dread pact. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_EMP_KF_Dip_Vampire_Acceptance_Positive_01	Very well - the living and dead shall work as one. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_EMP_KF_Dip_Vampire_Acceptance_Positive_02	The Grand Theogonist will curse me, but we have an agreement. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_EMP_KF_Dip_Vampire_Rejection_Negative_01	Not for all black powder in Nuln! By the grace of Sigmar, be gone, Undead filth! 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_EMP_KF_Dip_Vampire_Rejection_Negative_02	No, Vampire, no, I will send you back to Morr's realm for even suggesting such a thing! 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_EMP_KF_Dip_Vampire_Rejection_Neutral_01	You desecrate Morr's realm and expect me to endorse an alliance?	false
diplomacy_strings_string_EMP_KF_Dip_Vampire_Rejection_Neutral_02	A treaty with the Undead? Not as long as I rule! 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_EMP_KF_Dip_Vampire_Rejection_Positive_01	I think not, Vampire! 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_EMP_KF_Dip_Vampire_Rejection_Positive_02	You are no Lord or noble of the provinces, yet you come to me as an equal! 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_EMP_Volkmar_Dip_Bret_Greet_Neg_01	Your misplaced faith will be the ruin of your people.	false
diplomacy_strings_string_EMP_Volkmar_Dip_Bret_Greet_Neg_02	What do you want from me, Bretonnian?	false
diplomacy_strings_string_EMP_Volkmar_Dip_Bret_Greet_Neu_01	Speak, Bretonnian, I would know of what you seek?	false

diplomacy_strings_string_VAMP_Dip_Generic_Offer_Empire_Negative_02	Sigmar was a fraud, a mere barbarian who could not better Nagash. Bow to your true masters, cattle - these are our demands! 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_VAMP_Dip_Generic_Offer_Empire_Neutral_01	Tell the Prince of Altdorf that the true sovereign awaits his answer.  	false
diplomacy_strings_string_VAMP_Dip_Generic_Offer_Empire_Neutral_02	This Emperor, he speaks as if all voted for his ascension, yet  the true Counts of Stirland did not. But we can soften our stance should he consider this offer... 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_VAMP_Dip_Generic_Offer_Empire_Positive_01	We may have had differences in the past, but every Emperor has quarrelled with his Elector Counts, yes? May this offer help? 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_VAMP_Dip_Generic_Offer_Empire_Positive_02	We have a request, a small trifling matter in the grand scheme of things. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_VAMP_Dip_Generic_Offer_Greenskin_Negative_01	This is our demand, Orc-spawn, I advise you to take it and keep your filthy blood in your vile bodies. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_VAMP_Dip_Generic_Offer_Greenskin_Negative_02	Do not test me, Orc. To reveal my full majesty will seal the doom of your entire tribe. Now hear our demands and pray for my mercy. 	false

diplomacy_strings_string_VAMP_Dip_Generic_Offer_Greenskin_Neutral_02	Now Greenskins, unleash your true potential and accept the pact before you.	false
diplomacy_strings_string_VAMP_Dip_Generic_Offer_Greenskin_Positive_01	Orcs are unlikely allies, but if you are content to murder and maim, then we are happy to claim the corpses in your wake. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_VAMP_Dip_Generic_Offer_Greenskin_Positive_02	A great boss such as yourself will consider this arrangement, as the offer is a good one. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_VAMP_Dip_Generic_Offer_Negative_01	Fool! Our bloodlines ascend the centuries. Hear our demands! 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_VAMP_Dip_Generic_Offer_Negative_02	You will take our offer, for your bodies will wither and your souls be tortured for eternity if not. 	false

diplomacy_strings_string_VAMP_Dip_Generic_Offer_Positive_02	We come bearing gifts of life ever-lasting; it is the greatest gift - the Blood Kiss. Surely, it is worth adequate compensation?	false

diplomacy_strings_string_VAMP_Dip_Generic_Offer_Vampire_Negative_01	Get back, thrall, know thy place! I will leech your essence should you disobey my will. Now receive my demand and know thy place!  	false
diplomacy_strings_string_VAMP_Dip_Generic_Offer_Vampire_Negative_02	Your crippled bloodline is of no use to me, but there is a place in my legions should you bow to these demands. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_VAMP_Dip_Generic_Offer_Vampire_Neutral_01	As a servant of darkness, you should consider an offer from those that shroud the light. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_VAMP_Dip_Generic_Offer_Vampire_Neutral_02	The von Carsteins will march. Surely you wish to be part of such unholy majesty?	false
diplomacy_strings_string_VAMP_Dip_Generic_Offer_Vampire_Positive_01	Well, my kin, let us unite and bring eternal darkness to the world. There's just the small matter of this contract to sign... 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_VAMP_Dip_Generic_Offer_Vampire_Positive_02	If the Vampire Counts unite then none of the mortal filth can stop us. Make the pact and let the Age of Shadow begin! 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_VAMP_Dip_Offer_Cooperation_01	Perhaps a pact, or even a treaty if that sounds more agreeable? 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_VAMP_Dip_Offer_Cooperation_02	Should we ally, you have my blood oath that your corpse shall be left in peace. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_VAMP_Dip_Offer_Cooperation_03	Let us co-operate - a treaty between those that live and those who have lived? 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_VAMP_Dip_Offer_Cooperation_Bretonnia_01	A treaty will ensure that your smallfolk will be the only corpses we use. Your nobles will be for Morr only. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_VAMP_Dip_Offer_Cooperation_Bretonnia_02	Let the Lords of Mousillon charge with the flower of Bretonnia once more! 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_VAMP_Dip_Offer_Cooperation_Chaos_01	A pact with powers as determined as we are to snuff out life? It makes sense.  	false
diplomacy_strings_string_VAMP_Dip_Offer_Cooperation_Chaos_02	Bring forth your contract, Chaos filth. We will sign for there is no soul to lose. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_VAMP_Dip_Offer_Cooperation_Dwarf_01	Do we have an agreement, Dwarfs? It will earn you access to our tombs, where valuables and other trinkets could make this a most profitable venture.	false
diplomacy_strings_string_VAMP_Dip_Offer_Cooperation_Dwarf_02	Consider an alliance. Have we ever desecrated your dead like we do the humans? Have you ever seen a Vampire Dwarf? 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_VAMP_Dip_Offer_Cooperation_Empire_01	Come, let us truly unite the Empire. Bring Sylvania to your bosom and we will repay such loyalty in kind…	false
diplomacy_strings_string_VAMP_Dip_Offer_Cooperation_Empire_02	We were all men once, perhaps a vestigial of sentiment still remains that will allow us to come to terms? 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_VAMP_Dip_Offer_Cooperation_Greenskin_01	If you like carnage so much, Greenskin, then join us and we will ravage the world! 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_VAMP_Dip_Offer_Cooperation_Greenskin_02	Now is the time of darkness, when Orc and Necromancer shall inherit this rock they call a world. 	false

diplomacy_strings_string_VAMP_Dip_Offer_Gift_02	If you prefer I can give you the gift of my blood, a few drops is all it takes. Or you may choose anything in my vaults if your tastes are more… mundane.	false

diplomacy_strings_string_VAMP_Dip_Offer_Join_War_03	Add our unholy might to yours, and victory will come. We can then unpick the consequences of any pacts.	false
diplomacy_strings_string_VAMP_Dip_Offer_Peace_01	Rest in peace…	false
diplomacy_strings_string_VAMP_Dip_Offer_Peace_02	Our magicks weaken, so perhaps a cessation of the war is best?	false
diplomacy_strings_string_VAMP_Dip_Offer_Peace_03	We return to our graves and ready ourselves for Geheimnisnacht. You have peace until then. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_VAMP_Dip_Offer_Peace_Bretonnia_01	You have peace, Bretonnian. Bury your dead for they will not rise... for now. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_VAMP_Dip_Offer_Peace_Bretonnia_02	We are fed up of your rotten peasants, Bretonnian. There is peace because we crave fresh, wholesome bodies. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_VAMP_Dip_Offer_Peace_Chaos_01	Peace it is, Northman. Let Khorne worry about constant war, for we have all the time in the world!	false
diplomacy_strings_string_VAMP_Dip_Offer_Peace_Chaos_02	We know all too well what it is to desire blood. The difference between us, Chaos scum, is that we can control our thirst, so let peace reign.	false
diplomacy_strings_string_VAMP_Dip_Offer_Peace_Dwarf_01	No, Dwarf, there is no need to war. We return to Hunger Wood and the surroundings of Corpse Run, where we shall slake our desire for bloodshed.	false
diplomacy_strings_string_VAMP_Dip_Offer_Peace_Dwarf_02	Take the offer of peace, Dwarf. Forget your grudges and serve your race's interests for once.  	false
diplomacy_strings_string_VAMP_Dip_Offer_Peace_Empire_01	Vorhexen approaches. Go in peace, and have Morr's Priests prepare for the Night of Witches. Expect us to call then - Morrslieb shall be our sign.	false
diplomacy_strings_string_VAMP_Dip_Offer_Peace_Empire_02	I can say it in any language you wish - Khazalid, Queekish, Reikspiel? It is an offer of peace from the Midnight Aristocracy - I suggest you take it.	false
diplomacy_strings_string_VAMP_Dip_Offer_Peace_Greenskin_01	Peace, Orc - set your filthy minions on weaker prey, for we tire of you. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_VAMP_Dip_Offer_Peace_Greenskin_02	We will stop despoiling your filthy corpses if you stop attacking our lands. There are plenty of other, breathing creatures to annoy. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_VAMP_Dip_Offer_Peace_Vampire_01	Peace, my blood kin. Instead of war, let us drink a fine vintage - I have particularly arrogant Bretonnian noble in my cellar, with ripe veins.	false
diplomacy_strings_string_VAMP_Dip_Offer_Peace_Vampire_02	We offer peace. There will be a place at my table, should you accept.	false
diplomacy_strings_string_VAMP_Dip_Reject_Join_Confederation_01	There is only the Vampire Counts! 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_VAMP_Dip_Reject_Join_Confederation_02	No! Why would I walk in the light when I can stride alone at night! 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_VAMP_Dip_Reject_Join_Confederation_03	The only confederation will be when you have turned and are my willing thrall! 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_VAMP_Dip_Reject_Peace_01	There is no rest, no peace - just Undeath! 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_VAMP_Dip_Reject_Peace_02	No, your time has come. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_VAMP_Dip_Reject_Peace_03	Peace? That is what Otto von Drak begged for one night long ago, do you think our kind would revel in such power now had we granted such a feeble request? 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_VAMP_Dip_Reject_Peace_Bretonnia_01	Beg, Bretonnian. Lay down your lance, sully yourself in the mud and then beg for peace. The answer will still be no. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_VAMP_Dip_Reject_Peace_Bretonnia_02	There is no reason for peace. We despise your pitiful nation and will not stop until its people are part of my legions. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_VAMP_Dip_Reject_Peace_Chaos_01	Peace with the puppets of Chaos? Proof that the Ruinous Powers fear us - they know the true Dark Lords hail from Sylvania. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_VAMP_Dip_Reject_Peace_Chaos_02	You betray your brass god do you not, by asking for peace? How delicious! The answer is no. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_VAMP_Dip_Reject_Peace_Dwarf_01	We reject peace, Dwarf. Go back to your Holds, seal your gates, and know they will become your tombs. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_VAMP_Dip_Reject_Peace_Dwarf_02	Yours is a fetid race, one cursed with undeserving pride, which would be better purged from the world - that is the task I have set my tireless legions.	false
diplomacy_strings_string_VAMP_Dip_Reject_Peace_Empire_01	The only peace will be when the true Emperor sits upon the throne and wields Ghal Maraz. The Empire of Night will come!	false
diplomacy_strings_string_VAMP_Dip_Reject_Peace_Empire_02	The lambs of the Empire call for peace but all I hear is their bleating!	false
diplomacy_strings_string_VAMP_Dip_Reject_Peace_Greenskin_01	No peace, Orc, your race are pests that need eradicating. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_VAMP_Dip_Reject_Peace_Greenskin_02	There can be no peace with Greenskins. They are not mentally able, so we will wipe them out.	false
diplomacy_strings_string_VAMP_Dip_Reject_Peace_Vampire_01	I dominate the von Carsteins. You should have bent your knee earlier; now you will pay with the loss of your head. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_VAMP_Dip_Reject_Peace_Vampire_02	There can only be peace in Sylvania when these petty squabbles between kin are ended. And I will end it, for I am the true Lord of the von Carsteins.	false
diplomacy_strings_string_VAMP_Dip_War_01	The Undead march forth, it is war! 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_VAMP_Dip_War_02	We declare war, let night come forth! 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_VAMP_Dip_War_03	War, mortals! All will die and rise again. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_VAMP_Dip_War_Bretonnia_01	Time to end your pitiful nation once and for all, Bretonnian! 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_VAMP_Dip_War_Bretonnia_02	The peasants will revolt. But as my minions - war comes to Bretonnia! 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_VAMP_Dip_War_Chaos_01	War is as inevitable as the grave. Prepare thyselves, Chaos filth! 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_VAMP_Dip_War_Chaos_02	It is war! Surely your Blood God will rejoice?	false
diplomacy_strings_string_VAMP_Dip_War_Dwarf_01	We will bring death to the Dwarfish realms - war! 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_VAMP_Dip_War_Dwarf_02	War! The Age of the Dwarf is over, the Age of Undeath has begun! 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_VAMP_Dip_War_Empire_01	The Vampire Wars begin anew! 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_VAMP_Dip_War_Empire_02	Sigmar cannot protect you, mortals, war comes! 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_VAMP_Dip_War_Greenskin_01	It is war, then, Orc filth. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_VAMP_Dip_War_Greenskin_02	We will bring ruin on your tribes, Orc! 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_VAMP_Dip_War_Vampire_01	Sylvania will be overcome with war, it is time the lesser Vampires realised who is in charge.	false
diplomacy_strings_string_VAMP_Dip_War_Vampire_02	It is war! I am Undeath Ascendant, my will alone and no other! 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_VAMP_Kemm_Dip_Bret_Greet_Neg_01	There is a stain on the world, and that blight is called Bretonnia. But please, do go on!	false
diplomacy_strings_string_VAMP_Kemm_Dip_Bret_Greet_Neg_02	Ahh, my old stomping ground, so many deaths… is this a parley to stop me returning, I wonder?	false
diplomacy_strings_string_VAMP_Kemm_Dip_Bret_Greet_Neu_01	The minions of a King! Come to take my tally no doubt. Let us haggle for souls!	false
diplomacy_strings_string_VAMP_Kemm_Dip_Bret_Greet_Neu_02	I see no great Bretonnian flower here, what has become of my adopted nation?	false
diplomacy_strings_string_VAMP_Kemm_Dip_Bret_Greet_Pos_01	Ahh, it is good to be back in Bretonnia, how fair's the abbey at la Maisontaal?	false
diplomacy_strings_string_VAMP_Kemm_Dip_Bret_Greet_Pos_02	Greetings, messenger, tell Leoncoeur that my services are always open to him.	false
diplomacy_strings_string_VAMP_Kemm_Dip_Chaos_Greet_Neg_01	Chaos… you think you control me… bah! I am Kemmler, the Lichemaster, my destiny is my own!	false
diplomacy_strings_string_VAMP_Kemm_Dip_Chaos_Greet_Neg_02	Lickspittles approach me thinking they're in control. But I am the one that holds life or death in his hands.	false
diplomacy_strings_string_VAMP_Kemm_Dip_Chaos_Greet_Neu_01	Agents of Chaos, free me from these invisible obligations so I may cause my own mayhem!	false
diplomacy_strings_string_VAMP_Kemm_Dip_Chaos_Greet_Neu_02	The Dark Gods petition me, but they shall realise that I am no being's puppet!	false
diplomacy_strings_string_VAMP_Kemm_Dip_Chaos_Greet_Pos_01	Greetings, how do my true masters fair in these gloriously dark days?	false
diplomacy_strings_string_VAMP_Kemm_Dip_Chaos_Greet_Pos_02	At last the Chaos Gods come to me directly. What is their desire?	false
diplomacy_strings_string_VAMP_Kemm_Dip_Dwf_Greet_Neg_01	Approach me Dwarfs, envoys of your stunted kin, your offer better tickle me or I will damn you all!	false
diplomacy_strings_string_VAMP_Kemm_Dip_Dwf_Greet_Neg_02	Oh, how I enjoy the pleading, mewling bray of Dwarfs! It makes all this worth while!	false
diplomacy_strings_string_VAMP_Kemm_Dip_Dwf_Greet_Neu_01	Stunted beard-creatures, what have we here? You reach out to me, how wonderful!	false
diplomacy_strings_string_VAMP_Kemm_Dip_Dwf_Greet_Neu_02	There's desperation in your voice, Dwarf, be reassured that I find great pleasure in that!	false
diplomacy_strings_string_VAMP_Kemm_Dip_Dwf_Greet_Pos_01	Ah, the Dwarfs come to treat, to plead perhaps? To beg I don't reanimate their precious ancestors?	false
diplomacy_strings_string_VAMP_Kemm_Dip_Dwf_Greet_Pos_02	The Dwarfs - I have met your kind when I was wondering the mountains, you are beasts of burden are you not?	false
diplomacy_strings_string_VAMP_Kemm_Dip_Emp_Greet_Neg_01	Your Emperor’s mewling entreaties are as insufferable as the cries of a new-born child – and as easily choked off.	false
diplomacy_strings_string_VAMP_Kemm_Dip_Emp_Greet_Neg_02	Death comes to all eventually, and no pathetic Soldier-God may forestall that meeting. Time passes: speak!	false
diplomacy_strings_string_VAMP_Kemm_Dip_Emp_Greet_Neu_01	Oh, look, it's Sigmar's weak-willed progeny - I have dealt with you before it will take little effort to do so again.	false
diplomacy_strings_string_VAMP_Kemm_Dip_Emp_Greet_Neu_02	Your Empire is finished! So it is wise that you seek out my children and I.	false
diplomacy_strings_string_VAMP_Kemm_Dip_Emp_Greet_Pos_01	Ahh, Sigmar's children are my favourite vessels, I'm sure we can come to some arrangement, yes?	false
diplomacy_strings_string_VAMP_Kemm_Dip_Emp_Greet_Pos_02	Your eminence's emissaries are always so wary of me, I am but a humble old man looking to extend my miserly lot.	false
diplomacy_strings_string_VAMP_Kemm_Dip_Greet_Neg_01	Careful now, to summon me is all but an invite to join my hordes.	false
diplomacy_strings_string_VAMP_Kemm_Dip_Greet_Neg_02	Say what you must - but know you play a dangerous game, and I am no pawn!	false
diplomacy_strings_string_VAMP_Kemm_Dip_Greet_Neg_03	My minions are restless, this had better be important… for your sake!	false
diplomacy_strings_string_VAMP_Kemm_Dip_Greet_Neu_01	I will hear your words - your riddles! - but best not displease me, Krell would not like that!	false
diplomacy_strings_string_VAMP_Kemm_Dip_Greet_Neu_02	A message, for me? Then best deliver it, my children may not be impatient, but I am.	false
diplomacy_strings_string_VAMP_Kemm_Dip_Greet_Neu_03	Go on then, speak your words, but don't mistake for some hedge-wizard - I have more important masters than you.	false
diplomacy_strings_string_VAMP_Kemm_Dip_Greet_Pos_01	My Skull Wand cackles in my ear… it tells me you have a proposition, yes?	false
diplomacy_strings_string_VAMP_Kemm_Dip_Greet_Pos_02	Excuse the tomb-breath, now, what is it you want?	false
diplomacy_strings_string_VAMP_Kemm_Dip_Greet_Pos_03	You summon the Lichemaster, I see, I see. A pact is it?	false
diplomacy_strings_string_VAMP_Kemm_Dip_Grnskn_Greet_Neg_01	I always distrust Orcs that come to barter when they should be here to kill - weak specimens of their race.	false
diplomacy_strings_string_VAMP_Kemm_Dip_Grnskn_Greet_Neg_02	Greenskins - it is better say something interesting or I'll curse their whole sorry race.	false
diplomacy_strings_string_VAMP_Kemm_Dip_Grnskn_Greet_Neu_01	Orcs approach - how delightful! Should I have my thralls gut you now, or after you have spoken?	false
diplomacy_strings_string_VAMP_Kemm_Dip_Grnskn_Greet_Neu_02	The Greenskins are indeed a blight on the lands, mayhaps I can tame them?	false
diplomacy_strings_string_VAMP_Kemm_Dip_Grnskn_Greet_Pos_01	Greenskins, another of my favourites, what is it you desire?	false
diplomacy_strings_string_VAMP_Kemm_Dip_Grnskn_Greet_Pos_02	You know, many of my kin, cannot bring the Greenskin form back to life. I have no such trouble!	false
diplomacy_strings_string_VAMP_Kemm_Dip_Vamp_Greet_Neg_01	Oh, should I bow and scrape? The great vampire blood lines deign to call upon humble me…	false
diplomacy_strings_string_VAMP_Kemm_Dip_Vamp_Greet_Neg_02	Vampires and Necromancers both, they think they can raise the dead! But there is only one Lichemaster!	false
diplomacy_strings_string_VAMP_Kemm_Dip_Vamp_Greet_Neu_01	We will parley - for now, fellow immortals, you have the ear of the Lichemaster.	false
diplomacy_strings_string_VAMP_Kemm_Dip_Vamp_Greet_Neu_02	You will deliver your message to me and I will then decide on its worthiness, my lord.	false
diplomacy_strings_string_VAMP_Kemm_Dip_Vamp_Greet_Pos_01	My lords von Carstein, how may thy humble Liche, serve you this night?	false
diplomacy_strings_string_VAMP_Kemm_Dip_Vamp_Greet_Pos_02	I am always open to furthering the course of Unlife, please, please let's discuss plans.	false
diplomacy_strings_string_VAMP_Lord1_Dip_Acceptance_Negative_01	The pact is signed, pray it has only cost what you believe it has! Haha!	false
diplomacy_strings_string_VAMP_Lord1_Dip_Acceptance_Negative_02	So mortal, we have an agreement. Do not cross me, for that will be the last mistake you make. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_VAMP_Lord1_Dip_Acceptance_Negative_03	Mortal, we will accept but do not mistake this for anything but a convenience - we are not your allies, we are your masters! 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_VAMP_Lord1_Dip_Acceptance_Neutral_01	I accept, now you must fulfil your promise or I bring eternal darkness upon you! 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_VAMP_Lord1_Dip_Acceptance_Neutral_02	We will bind this treaty in blood. The cost if you renege? Just your immortal soul! 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_VAMP_Lord1_Dip_Acceptance_Neutral_03	Only the well-prepared or the very foolish join a pact with a Vampire. Now the deal is done, which one are you? 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_VAMP_Lord1_Dip_Acceptance_Positive_01	A pact then! My services for what I desire, the price maybe too dear? 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_VAMP_Lord1_Dip_Acceptance_Positive_02	An agreement - mine hordes shall rejoice, for I will command them to. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_VAMP_Lord1_Dip_Acceptance_Positive_03	Yes, there is a way we can both claim what we need from this understanding. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_VAMP_Lord1_Dip_Bret_Greet_Neg_01	You come with Lady's tidings? What does that lake-hag want? 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_VAMP_Lord1_Dip_Bret_Greet_Neg_02	Before we can begin, I must slaughter all the low-born in your ranks. They are your gift, yess? 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_VAMP_Lord1_Dip_Bret_Greet_Neu_01	Impress me then, Bretonnian. What favour does your impuissant nation deign to ask?	false
diplomacy_strings_string_VAMP_Lord1_Dip_Bret_Greet_Neu_02	Bretonnia must be in trouble to come here. Does Mousillon fare badly? 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_VAMP_Lord1_Dip_Bret_Greet_Pos_01	Bretonnians! Come then, let us eat and talk - once the meal is over I’ll decide if you shall live. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_VAMP_Lord1_Dip_Bret_Greet_Pos_02	What message do you bring, Bretonnian? Do the living still delude themselves?	false
diplomacy_strings_string_VAMP_Lord1_Dip_Bretonnia_Acceptance_Negative_01	Your folk taste of desperation and sorrow - it is a fine vintage, so let's agree terms. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_VAMP_Lord1_Dip_Bretonnia_Acceptance_Negative_02	Yes, you will do as I say, Bretonnians - if you value your pathetic lives! 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_VAMP_Lord1_Dip_Bretonnia_Acceptance_Neutral_01	Agreed, but do not risk offending me by asking for further quarter, Knight. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_VAMP_Lord1_Dip_Bretonnia_Acceptance_Neutral_02	As a show of favour I require the company of your damsel... no "permanent" harm shall come to her. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_VAMP_Lord1_Dip_Bretonnia_Acceptance_Positive_01	Very well, Knight, we have an accord, pray to the Lady that you do not disappoint me. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_VAMP_Lord1_Dip_Bretonnia_Acceptance_Positive_02	I'll take your word, mortal creature, but if you do not deliver I will find you. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_VAMP_Lord1_Dip_Bretonnia_Rejection_Negative_01	No, your insignificant country is finished, fools! Your only choice is to bow before me and pray on my mercy. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_VAMP_Lord1_Dip_Bretonnia_Rejection_Negative_02	I reject this and any such offer, why would I need the aid of such living, feckless cowards? 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_VAMP_Lord1_Dip_Bretonnia_Rejection_Neutral_01	Haha, Bretonnia is a mongrel nation and I have no desire to help it. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_VAMP_Lord1_Dip_Bretonnia_Rejection_Neutral_02	Never - tell your lake hag I will drink her life force, should we ever meet. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_VAMP_Lord1_Dip_Bretonnia_Rejection_Positive_01	No, this won't do, not this day or ever, Knight.  	false
diplomacy_strings_string_VAMP_Lord1_Dip_Bretonnia_Rejection_Positive_02	Get from my sight, Bretonnian, you are lucky that I am sated. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_VAMP_Lord1_Dip_Chaos_Acceptance_Negative_01	So be it - a union with the Archaon's insipid followers is a small price to pay for mine own domination. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_VAMP_Lord1_Dip_Chaos_Acceptance_Negative_02	Yes, a pact, but do not betray us, even your gods will cower before my wrath! 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_VAMP_Lord1_Dip_Chaos_Acceptance_Neutral_01	Good, this is a pact, the forces of Chaos and Undead will join and those of Order will pay. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_VAMP_Lord1_Dip_Chaos_Acceptance_Neutral_02	Agreed, Northman, do not fail me. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_VAMP_Lord1_Dip_Chaos_Acceptance_Positive_01	Good - the Dark Gods shall work in concert with mine own designs. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_VAMP_Lord1_Dip_Chaos_Acceptance_Positive_02	Very well, creature, tell your true masters we have a deal. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_VAMP_Lord1_Dip_Chaos_Greet_Neg_01	Careful, Warrior, for you know not who you treat with. My power is death; my will absolute. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_VAMP_Lord1_Dip_Chaos_Greet_Neg_02	I have no more patience for the maggots of Chaos, they are nought but scavengers in my wake!	false
diplomacy_strings_string_VAMP_Lord1_Dip_Chaos_Greet_Neu_01	Spit your hate at me, Chaos creature, I care not for your Gods or their threats! 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_VAMP_Lord1_Dip_Chaos_Greet_Neu_02	Rage all you wish, minion, but know that I am no peon, I create them! 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_VAMP_Lord1_Dip_Chaos_Greet_Pos_01	What is your message, Chaos pawn? Mark that you do not address some quivering mortal!	false
diplomacy_strings_string_VAMP_Lord1_Dip_Chaos_Greet_Pos_02	Welcome, messenger of the Dark Gods, if your terms intrigue me, we could work together. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_VAMP_Lord1_Dip_Chaos_Rejection_Negative_01	You think me weak, Chaos scum? I am a Lord of Darkness and answer to no god! 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_VAMP_Lord1_Dip_Chaos_Rejection_Negative_02	Your Gods cannot touch me, thrall, my will is stronger than any atrophied deity's! 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_VAMP_Lord1_Dip_Chaos_Rejection_Neutral_01	No. I do not fear you or your Gods for my soul has already been claimed. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_VAMP_Lord1_Dip_Chaos_Rejection_Neutral_02	Chaos creature - go back north to thy fetid realm, tell your masters these mortals are mine.   	false
diplomacy_strings_string_VAMP_Lord1_Dip_Chaos_Rejection_Positive_01	No Chaos thrall, my destiny will not be tampered by Tzeentch. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_VAMP_Lord1_Dip_Chaos_Rejection_Positive_02	Alas, I must reject this notion, although we may join our damned forces in the future.	false
diplomacy_strings_string_VAMP_Lord1_Dip_Dwarf_Acceptance_Negative_01	Sign your precious contract, bearded creature, parchment will do you no good when I bore of it. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_VAMP_Lord1_Dip_Dwarf_Acceptance_Negative_02	I demand a sacrifice to prove your willingness to this endeavour, but what will it be? A life or your so-called honour? 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_VAMP_Lord1_Dip_Dwarf_Acceptance_Neutral_01	We have a blood pact then, Dwarf. It will cost you more than dishonour if you break it. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_VAMP_Lord1_Dip_Dwarf_Acceptance_Neutral_02	Very good, I know such a treaty raises the hairs in your beard, Dwarf. That thought alone makes this worth it. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_VAMP_Lord1_Dip_Dwarf_Acceptance_Positive_01	Very well Dwarf. Show me your contract and I will sign it… in beardling blood! 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_VAMP_Lord1_Dip_Dwarf_Acceptance_Positive_02	Good, Dwarf, you'll do as I say! 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_VAMP_Lord1_Dip_Dwarf_Rejection_Negative_01	You think your broken empire can be repaired, Dwarf? You are wrong and my legions will prove it! 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_VAMP_Lord1_Dip_Dwarf_Rejection_Negative_02	Never! My Crypt Ghouls will gnaw on your ancestors' fetid bones! 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_VAMP_Lord1_Dip_Dwarf_Rejection_Neutral_01	I think not, stone-gatherer! Your desolate mountain slums offer nothing for my host. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_VAMP_Lord1_Dip_Dwarf_Rejection_Neutral_02	There is no pact! Your arrogance will be your undoing, Dwarf scum! 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_VAMP_Lord1_Dip_Dwarf_Rejection_Positive_01	No, stone-gatherer. Back to your mountain holes. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_VAMP_Lord1_Dip_Dwarf_Rejection_Positive_02	Don't be foolish, Dwarf, I care not one bit for your barren halls. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_VAMP_Lord1_Dip_Dwf_Greet_Neg_01	Why do the Dwarfs pester me so? I have had my fill of their stunted forms and baseless pride! 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_VAMP_Lord1_Dip_Dwf_Greet_Neg_02	The last time I killed a Dwarf, I sucked the marrow from his iron-flecked bones, but do go on… 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_VAMP_Lord1_Dip_Dwf_Greet_Neu_01	Dwarfs… Rarely can you get a clean bite of their neck, far too hairy, what do you want?	false
diplomacy_strings_string_VAMP_Lord1_Dip_Dwf_Greet_Neu_02	Tell me Dawi, why should I not leech you of life whence you stand? 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_VAMP_Lord1_Dip_Dwf_Greet_Pos_01	Why Dwarfs! How amusing of you to deign to talk to me. What do you wish? 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_VAMP_Lord1_Dip_Dwf_Greet_Pos_02	Here come the Dwarfs to sour my mood, what do the stone-gatherers want? 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_VAMP_Lord1_Dip_Emp_Greet_Neu_01	I wonder which one of your party is a Witch Hunter? He shall die first. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_VAMP_Lord1_Dip_Emp_Greet_Neu_02	So, Franz sends his sheep to bargain for their own lives. A pity it is harvest time.	false
diplomacy_strings_string_VAMP_Lord1_Dip_Emp_Greet_Pos_01	Welcome to the midnight realm, pray to your Man-God we come to an accommodation. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_VAMP_Lord1_Dip_Emp_Greet_Pos_02	Greetings, only noble blood should deign to negotiate and we are the noblest of all! 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_VAMP_Lord1_Dip_Empire_Acceptance_Negative_01	Then we have a pact - betray this and I'll bleed every Sigmarite priest from here to Altdorf! 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_VAMP_Lord1_Dip_Empire_Acceptance_Negative_02	What a strange night! Me allying with the bags of flesh I call food!	false
diplomacy_strings_string_VAMP_Lord1_Dip_Empire_Acceptance_Neutral_01	Do not be afraid - you will find me a benevolent lord, as long as you do not fail me.  	false
diplomacy_strings_string_VAMP_Lord1_Dip_Empire_Acceptance_Neutral_02	Sign the treaty in blood, mortal. I wish - I need - to see you bleed! 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_VAMP_Lord1_Dip_Empire_Acceptance_Positive_01	Sigmar's heirs shall ally with Vlad's progeny - truly a match worthy of legend!	false
diplomacy_strings_string_VAMP_Lord1_Dip_Empire_Acceptance_Positive_02	Yes, we have a pact, Empire-men. Do not disappoint me. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_VAMP_Lord1_Dip_Empire_Greeting_Negative_01	You come in the name of 'Sigmar', a mere mortal man born of camp whores, yet called himself a 'god' - what, mortals?	false
diplomacy_strings_string_VAMP_Lord1_Dip_Empire_Greeting_Negative_02	The Empire is finished, you mortals just wont accept it. Speak then… 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_VAMP_Lord1_Dip_Empire_Rejection_Negative_01	What fools Ulric's progeny are! If you leave here alive you will do so as my puppets!	false
diplomacy_strings_string_VAMP_Lord1_Dip_Empire_Rejection_Negative_02	No! I will never signs pacts with Karl Franz' inbred brood - you are not even fit to drink!	false
diplomacy_strings_string_VAMP_Lord1_Dip_Empire_Rejection_Neutral_01	Curse all the living, and their fruitless attempts to remain so.	false
diplomacy_strings_string_VAMP_Lord1_Dip_Empire_Rejection_Neutral_02	Your Empire is doomed - it will be Sylvania that rises from the ashes.	false
diplomacy_strings_string_VAMP_Lord1_Dip_Empire_Rejection_Positive_01	No, I find your kind - breathers - too disagreeable.	false
diplomacy_strings_string_VAMP_Lord1_Dip_Empire_Rejection_Positive_02	Thank your Man-God that I don't feed on you right now! Be gone! 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_VAMP_Lord1_Dip_Greenskin_Acceptance_Negative_01	It will do I suppose. However, I bore easily these days, so keep your stinking minions on-side or else.	false
diplomacy_strings_string_VAMP_Lord1_Dip_Greenskin_Acceptance_Negative_02	It is an accord, creature, but only while our ends walk the same path, once we diverge you shall be exterminated. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_VAMP_Lord1_Dip_Greenskin_Acceptance_Neutral_01	Yes, Orc, we have a deal. Pray to whatever disgusting gods you worship that I don't change my mind. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_VAMP_Lord1_Dip_Greenskin_Acceptance_Neutral_02	I accept your terms, Orc. Should you fail then your body is mine to take. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_VAMP_Lord1_Dip_Greenskin_Acceptance_Positive_01	Very well, the crude beasts shall rampage and our silent armies will follow in their wake. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_VAMP_Lord1_Dip_Greenskin_Acceptance_Positive_02	Good, an agreement. Let us hope the Orcs are capable of remembering it is in place.	false
diplomacy_strings_string_VAMP_Lord1_Dip_Greenskin_Rejection_Negative_01	A strange notion - mine noble blood line allying with such base creatures. No, better to destroy you. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_VAMP_Lord1_Dip_Greenskin_Rejection_Negative_02	Even Nagash, balked at allying with Greenskins. For once I agree with him - not ever, Orc scum! 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_VAMP_Lord1_Dip_Greenskin_Rejection_Neutral_01	No, my bloodline is pure, I will not sully it by working with such creatures. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_VAMP_Lord1_Dip_Greenskin_Rejection_Neutral_02	I will not consider such an alliance. You are base creatures and I only feast on the finest. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_VAMP_Lord1_Dip_Greenskin_Rejection_Positive_01	No, Orcs, I don't trust you - I despise free will. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_VAMP_Lord1_Dip_Greenskin_Rejection_Positive_02	Foolish Orc, just because I prefer to drain humans doesn't mean I cannot snack on beasts! 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_VAMP_Lord1_Dip_Greet_Neg_01	Morrslieb glows… I can tell, for you come thinking to bargain, but I have already won! 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_VAMP_Lord1_Dip_Greet_Neg_02	There is desperation in your pitiful eyes! That knowledge alone will be leveraged against you! 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_VAMP_Lord1_Dip_Greet_Neg_03	You reek of anguish, or hopelessness, haha! Yes, let us parley! 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_VAMP_Lord1_Dip_Greet_Neu_01	Mannslieb wanes and Morrslieb waxes, of course I was expecting you. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_VAMP_Lord1_Dip_Greet_Neu_02	Ahh, you come here in desperation, yess? Good, I can deal with desperate mortals. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_VAMP_Lord1_Dip_Greet_Neu_03	To stand before me and ask, proves you are no craven… but cowards often live longer!	false
diplomacy_strings_string_VAMP_Lord1_Dip_Greet_Pos_01	Why, do come - what can we help you with this night? 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_VAMP_Lord1_Dip_Greet_Pos_02	Ahh! You seek out the von Carsteins, a bold action…  	false
diplomacy_strings_string_VAMP_Lord1_Dip_Greet_Pos_03	I'll have you speak now, pray to your gods I like what you say. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_VAMP_Lord1_Dip_Grnskn_Greet_Neg_01	What could you possibly offer me, Orc, I cannot even drink your abhorrent blood!	false
diplomacy_strings_string_VAMP_Lord1_Dip_Grnskn_Greet_Neg_02	Greenskin, I cannot tame you, so tell me, why I should not wipe you out? 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_VAMP_Lord1_Dip_Grnskn_Greet_Neu_01	How vile… what could you possibly offer me, Orc? 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_VAMP_Lord1_Dip_Grnskn_Greet_Neu_02	Greenskin, you are stood before me alive for I despise the taste of your fell blood, so speak. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_VAMP_Lord1_Dip_Grnskn_Greet_Pos_01	I will address the Orc creature, I hope I can understand its guttural tongue. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_VAMP_Lord1_Dip_Grnskn_Greet_Pos_02	Deliver your message, Greenskin, just maybe we can work together. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_VAMP_Lord1_Dip_Rejection_Negative_01	Never! You are to be dominated, not appeased! 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_VAMP_Lord1_Dip_Rejection_Negative_02	Foolish mortals, why would we treat with cattle?	false
diplomacy_strings_string_VAMP_Lord1_Dip_Rejection_Negative_03	No, prepare your armies, ready your defences - it will do no good! 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_VAMP_Lord1_Dip_Rejection_Neutral_01	No, why should I make pact when I can take what I need from you?	false
diplomacy_strings_string_VAMP_Lord1_Dip_Rejection_Neutral_02	No! You offer me baubles! I will take what is rightfully mine! 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_VAMP_Lord1_Dip_Rejection_Neutral_03	There is nothing as foolish as a mortal with a shred of power. I can show you true power! 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_VAMP_Lord1_Dip_Rejection_Positive_01	No… and thank your pathetic gods my attention is pulled elsewhere. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_VAMP_Lord1_Dip_Rejection_Positive_02	I think not! 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_VAMP_Lord1_Dip_Rejection_Positive_03	Not this time, but should you desire something more then call on me. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_VAMP_Lord1_Dip_Vamp_Greet_Neg_01	Dawn approaches and mongrel blood lines come to leech off me. What do you want, half-breed? 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_VAMP_Lord1_Dip_Vamp_Greet_Neg_02	Call yourself von Carstein? I have seen Strigoi more noble than you! Your offer then? 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_VAMP_Lord1_Dip_Vamp_Greet_Neu_01	Welcome, kin. You must want something, it better not be my head! 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_VAMP_Lord1_Dip_Vamp_Greet_Neu_02	It is always a pleasure - a dubious pleasure - to welcome a fellow Lord of the Night to my domain.  	false
diplomacy_strings_string_VAMP_Lord1_Dip_Vamp_Greet_Pos_01	Greetings, brothers, what does mine Blood Line require?	false
diplomacy_strings_string_VAMP_Lord1_Dip_Vamp_Greet_Pos_02	Very well, let us hold a conclave, my kin. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_VAMP_Lord1_Dip_Vampire_Acceptance_Negative_01	Very well, cur, but betray me and I'll take your head and gift it to Volkmar's minions. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_VAMP_Lord1_Dip_Vampire_Acceptance_Negative_02	Agreed then, parasite, for that is all you are!	false
diplomacy_strings_string_VAMP_Lord1_Dip_Vampire_Acceptance_Neutral_01	Yes, we will swell the von Carstein hosts, and the living shall fear us! 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_VAMP_Lord1_Dip_Vampire_Acceptance_Neutral_02	With Morrslieb so high in the sky, it makes sense for a union.	false
diplomacy_strings_string_VAMP_Lord1_Dip_Vampire_Acceptance_Positive_01	Yes, together we will feast on mortal flesh!	false
diplomacy_strings_string_VAMP_Lord1_Dip_Vampire_Acceptance_Positive_02	Agreed, kin, this will end mortal dominion. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_VAMP_Lord1_Dip_Vampire_Rejection_Negative_01	No, do not mistake us, we are not the same. You are a vessel of filthy blood, mine is pure and I shall wipe you out. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_VAMP_Lord1_Dip_Vampire_Rejection_Negative_02	Parasites are drawn to me like fleas on some mangy cur! Get thee from my sight or I'll end you! 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_VAMP_Lord1_Dip_Vampire_Rejection_Neutral_01	I don't think so. I do not need your shambling hordes, I have access to much better stock. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_VAMP_Lord1_Dip_Vampire_Rejection_Neutral_02	With callous respect, I reject your offer... it lacks bite. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_VAMP_Lord1_Dip_Vampire_Rejection_Positive_01	As the true master of this realm, I disagree. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_VAMP_Lord1_Dip_Vampire_Rejection_Positive_02	Please - challenge me, feel my power and realise you are outmatched. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_VAMP_Lord2_Dip_Bret_Greet_Neg_01	You come with Lady's tidings? What does that lake-hag want? 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_VAMP_Lord2_Dip_Bret_Greet_Neg_02	Before we can begin, I must slaughter all the low-born in your ranks. They are your gift, yess? 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_VAMP_Lord2_Dip_Bret_Greet_Neu_01	Impress me then, envoy. What favour does your impuissant king deign to ask?  	false
diplomacy_strings_string_VAMP_Lord2_Dip_Bret_Greet_Neu_02	Bretonnia must be in trouble to come here. Does Mousillon fare badly? 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_VAMP_Lord2_Dip_Bret_Greet_Pos_01	Bretonnians! Come then, let us eat and talk - once the meal is over I’ll decide if you shall live. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_VAMP_Lord2_Dip_Bret_Greet_Pos_02	What message from your king, Bretonnian? Do the living still delude themselves? 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_VAMP_Lord2_Dip_Chaos_Greet_Neg_01	Careful, Warrior, for you know not who you treat with. My power is death; my will absolute. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_VAMP_Lord2_Dip_Chaos_Greet_Neg_02	I have no more patience for the maggots of Chaos, they are nought but scavengers in my wake!	false
diplomacy_strings_string_VAMP_Lord2_Dip_Chaos_Greet_Neu_01	Spit your hate at me, Chaos creature, I care not for your Gods or their threats! 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_VAMP_Lord2_Dip_Chaos_Greet_Neu_02	Rage all you wish, minion, but know that I am no peon, I create them! 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_VAMP_Lord2_Dip_Chaos_Greet_Pos_01	What is your message, Chaos pawn? Mark that you do not address some quivering mortal!	false
diplomacy_strings_string_VAMP_Lord2_Dip_Chaos_Greet_Pos_02	Welcome, messenger of the Dark Gods, if your terms intrigue me, we could work together. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_VAMP_Lord2_Dip_Dwf_Greet_Neg_01	Why do the Dwarfs pester me so? I have had my fill of their stunted forms and baseless pride! 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_VAMP_Lord2_Dip_Dwf_Greet_Neg_02	The last time I killed a Dwarf, I sucked the marrow from his iron-flecked bones, but do go on… 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_VAMP_Lord2_Dip_Dwf_Greet_Neu_01	Dwarfs… Rarely can you get a clean bite of their neck, far too hairy, what do you want?	false
diplomacy_strings_string_VAMP_Lord2_Dip_Dwf_Greet_Neu_02	Tell me Dawi, why should I not leech you of life whence you stand? 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_VAMP_Lord2_Dip_Dwf_Greet_Pos_01	Why Dwarfs! How amusing of you to deign to talk to me. What do you wish? 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_VAMP_Lord2_Dip_Dwf_Greet_Pos_02	Here come the Dwarfs to sour my mood, what do the stone-gatherers want? 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_VAMP_Lord2_Dip_Emp_Greet_Neu_01	I wonder which one of your party is a Witch Hunter? He shall die first. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_VAMP_Lord2_Dip_Emp_Greet_Neu_02	So, Franz sends his sheep to bargain for their own lives. A pity it is harvest time. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_VAMP_Lord2_Dip_Emp_Greet_Pos_01	Welcome to the midnight realm, pray to your Man-God we come to an accommodation. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_VAMP_Lord2_Dip_Emp_Greet_Pos_02	Greetings, only noble blood should deign to negotiate and we are the noblest of all! 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_VAMP_Lord2_Dip_Empire_Greeting_Negative_01	You come in the name of 'Franz', a man born of dock whores, yet calls himself a 'prince' - what, mortals? 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_VAMP_Lord2_Dip_Empire_Greeting_Negative_02	The Empire is finished, you mortals just wont accept it. Speak then… 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_VAMP_Lord2_Dip_Greet_Neg_01	Morrslieb glows… I can tell, for you come thinking to bargain, but I have already won! 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_VAMP_Lord2_Dip_Greet_Neg_02	There is desperation in your pitiful eyes! That knowledge alone will be leveraged against you! 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_VAMP_Lord2_Dip_Greet_Neg_03	You reek of anguish, or hopelessness, haha! Yes, let's us parley! 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_VAMP_Lord2_Dip_Greet_Neu_01	Mannslieb wanes and Morrslieb waxes, of course I was expecting you. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_VAMP_Lord2_Dip_Greet_Neu_02	Ahh, you come here in desperation, yess? Good, I can deal with desperate mortals. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_VAMP_Lord2_Dip_Greet_Neu_03	To stand before me and ask, proves you are no craven… but cowards often live longer!	false
diplomacy_strings_string_VAMP_Lord2_Dip_Greet_Pos_01	Why, do come - what can we help you with this night? 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_VAMP_Lord2_Dip_Greet_Pos_02	Ahh! You seek out the von Carsteins, a bold action…  	false
diplomacy_strings_string_VAMP_Lord2_Dip_Greet_Pos_03	I'll have you speak now, pray to your gods I like what you say. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_VAMP_Lord2_Dip_Grnskn_Greet_Neg_01	What could you possibly offer me, Orc, I cannot even drink your abhorrent blood!	false
diplomacy_strings_string_VAMP_Lord2_Dip_Grnskn_Greet_Neg_02	Greenskin, I cannot tame you, so tell me, why I should not wipe you out? 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_VAMP_Lord2_Dip_Grnskn_Greet_Neu_01	How vile… what could you possibly offer me, Orc? 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_VAMP_Lord2_Dip_Grnskn_Greet_Neu_02	Greenskin, you are stood before me alive for a despise the taste of your fell blood, so speak. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_VAMP_Lord2_Dip_Grnskn_Greet_Pos_01	I will address the Orc creature, I hope I can understand its guttural tongue. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_VAMP_Lord2_Dip_Grnskn_Greet_Pos_02	Deliver your message, Greenskin, just maybe we can work together. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_VAMP_Lord2_Dip_Vamp_Greet_Neg_01	Dawn approaches and mongrel blood lines come to leech off me. What do you want, half-breed? 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_VAMP_Lord2_Dip_Vamp_Greet_Neg_02	Call yourself von Carstein? I have seen Strigoi more noble than you! Your offer then? 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_VAMP_Lord2_Dip_Vamp_Greet_Neu_01	Welcome, kin. You must want something, it better not be my head! 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_VAMP_Lord2_Dip_Vamp_Greet_Neu_02	It is always a pleasure - a dubious pleasure - to welcome a fellow Lord of the Night to my domain.  	false
diplomacy_strings_string_VAMP_Lord2_Dip_Vamp_Greet_Pos_01	Greetings, brothers, what does mine Blood Line require?	false
diplomacy_strings_string_VAMP_Lord2_Dip_Vamp_Greet_Pos_02	Very well, let us hold a conclave, my kin. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_VAMP_Mannfred_Dip_Acceptance_Negative_01	I will take thy word, but only a fool would renege on me. Are you a fool, mortal? 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_VAMP_Mannfred_Dip_Acceptance_Negative_02	Bind your soul to this commitment. It is forfeit if thou fail me! 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_VAMP_Mannfred_Dip_Acceptance_Negative_03	I accept those terms, but the reek of betrayal surrounds thou. I warn thee, do not succumb to it! 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_VAMP_Mannfred_Dip_Acceptance_Neutral_01	I accept these terms, we'll sign the contracts in blood… thy blood. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_VAMP_Mannfred_Dip_Acceptance_Neutral_02	We have agreement, mortal, keep thou side of the bargain and I may do mine.	false
diplomacy_strings_string_VAMP_Mannfred_Dip_Acceptance_Neutral_03	Very well, we have a pact. Do not disappoint me. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_VAMP_Mannfred_Dip_Acceptance_Positive_01	A fine choice, one I will savour! 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_VAMP_Mannfred_Dip_Acceptance_Positive_02	Thou hast chosen wisely, mortal. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_VAMP_Mannfred_Dip_Acceptance_Positive_03	This is the correct pact to make! 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_VAMP_Mannfred_Dip_Bret_Greet_Neg_01	Thou strivest to preserve that which is already lost, Bretonnian fool. Nevertheless, I will hear thine offer! 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_VAMP_Mannfred_Dip_Bret_Greet_Neg_02	I shall harken to thy king's words - but I can already tell thee, the answer shall not be to thine liking, mortal… 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_VAMP_Mannfred_Dip_Bret_Greet_Neu_01	Bretonnian, make thine offer. Only then shall I decide if thou join mine hordes or return to thy feckless lands. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_VAMP_Mannfred_Dip_Bret_Greet_Neu_02	I struggle to address the riddle in mine head - art thou brave or foolish for approaching me with this 'offer'? 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_VAMP_Mannfred_Dip_Bret_Greet_Pos_01	Hahaha - mortals of Bretonnia, welcome. Drink of this wine, I have some robust reds in my cellar… 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_VAMP_Mannfred_Dip_Bret_Greet_Pos_02	How fares thy kingdom? I hear of unrest in thy city of Mousillon, nothing too troubling I hope…	false
diplomacy_strings_string_VAMP_Mannfred_Dip_Bretonnia_Acceptance_Negative_01	A truce then - if such a thing is needed with such an insignificant nation of flesh bags. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_VAMP_Mannfred_Dip_Bretonnia_Acceptance_Negative_02	Scrawl thy name on this contract mortal, do it in blood so I can scent you out, when thy betray me! 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_VAMP_Mannfred_Dip_Bretonnia_Acceptance_Neutral_01	I accept, mine Knights and thous shall charge as one. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_VAMP_Mannfred_Dip_Bretonnia_Acceptance_Neutral_02	Very well - thy smallfolk shall not be feasted on until our alliance comes to an end. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_VAMP_Mannfred_Dip_Bretonnia_Acceptance_Positive_01	Yesss, why not… and should thy troops prove feckless in life I may have a use for them in death.	false
diplomacy_strings_string_VAMP_Mannfred_Dip_Bretonnia_Acceptance_Positive_02	We have a pact, thrall of the Breton. Do not fail me. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_VAMP_Mannfred_Dip_Bretonnia_Rejection_Negative_01	I have no time for such pathetic creatures - thy blood is thin, thou lands are riddled with disease. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_VAMP_Mannfred_Dip_Bretonnia_Rejection_Negative_02	Haha, you are some thrall, recently emerged from the Blood Kiss? My legions shall march on Bretonnia not ally with it! 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_VAMP_Mannfred_Dip_Bretonnia_Rejection_Neutral_01	Back to your dreary land, mortal - tell the wench you worship that I shall suck her people dry! 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_VAMP_Mannfred_Dip_Bretonnia_Rejection_Neutral_02	No… Now thy must face my legions... and they hunger… 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_VAMP_Mannfred_Dip_Bretonnia_Rejection_Positive_01	I think not. Take your offers back to thy wretched realm; tell thy nobles to expect me soon enough. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_VAMP_Mannfred_Dip_Bretonnia_Rejection_Positive_02	Such an alliance was always unlikely, mortals. Thy stock tend to make weak allies. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_VAMP_Mannfred_Dip_Chaos_Acceptance_Negative_01	So be it. I'll deign to work with the Chaos Gods, but take care not to let thy servants anger me, for there will be consequence.	false
diplomacy_strings_string_VAMP_Mannfred_Dip_Chaos_Acceptance_Negative_02	Yes, we shall work together to free the world of the living, but when thou think to betray, know that my vengeance will run deep. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_VAMP_Mannfred_Dip_Chaos_Acceptance_Neutral_01	This suits our purposes, tell thy master we have a pact.	false
diplomacy_strings_string_VAMP_Mannfred_Dip_Chaos_Acceptance_Neutral_02	Very well, but do not mistake this for acquiescence on all souls. The von Carsteins will have their share! 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_VAMP_Mannfred_Dip_Chaos_Acceptance_Positive_01	Agreed - the mortals will despair! 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_VAMP_Mannfred_Dip_Chaos_Acceptance_Positive_02	Yesss, a doom befalls the world. If I can't have it no one will!  	false
diplomacy_strings_string_VAMP_Mannfred_Dip_Chaos_Greet_Neg_01	The so-called Everchosen has no idea with whom he trifles! Bid him to step into thine court so that I may rip his throat out!	false
diplomacy_strings_string_VAMP_Mannfred_Dip_Chaos_Greet_Neg_02	Thine Chaos Gods are spectators to what happens here. I am the God of Inexhaustible Blood and I shall have my way! 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_VAMP_Mannfred_Dip_Chaos_Greet_Neu_01	Chaos, thy Gods mutate thee as reward, but I can give thee the ultimate gift… death. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_VAMP_Mannfred_Dip_Chaos_Greet_Neu_02	Speak then, Northman, but know I shall drink thy bestial blood if thou displeases me. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_VAMP_Mannfred_Dip_Chaos_Greet_Pos_01	Welcome, brothers of the darkness. What could mine blood line do for thee? 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_VAMP_Mannfred_Dip_Chaos_Greet_Pos_02	Ahh, the minions of Chaos, come to mine grave, looking for common cause no doubt? 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_VAMP_Mannfred_Dip_Chaos_Rejection_Negative_01	No, the mortals belong to me! Send thy champions in challenge and I will end them all. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_VAMP_Mannfred_Dip_Chaos_Rejection_Negative_02	I think not! Tell thy Lord Archaon, he is a greedy peon to weakling Gods and that will cost him dear!	false
diplomacy_strings_string_VAMP_Mannfred_Dip_Chaos_Rejection_Neutral_01	No, tainted ones, I would feast on your flesh if I knew thou blood was not infected so. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_VAMP_Mannfred_Dip_Chaos_Rejection_Neutral_02	I see no benefit here - Archaon is a fool, a charlatan who needs to be taught a lesson in manners. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_VAMP_Mannfred_Dip_Chaos_Rejection_Positive_01	Thou hast erred, Chaos thrall - we both wish death upon the world, but while thou take souls - I cull them! 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_VAMP_Mannfred_Dip_Chaos_Rejection_Positive_02	Impossible - the cattle are mine to reap, not yours to taint! 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_VAMP_Mannfred_Dip_Dwarf_Acceptance_Negative_01	An alliance with piteous stone-gatherers and grudge-mongers? Very well, mortals. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_VAMP_Mannfred_Dip_Dwarf_Acceptance_Negative_02	An alliance with such close-minded creatures… acceptable on this occasion. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_VAMP_Mannfred_Dip_Dwarf_Acceptance_Neutral_01	Why, yes, prepare thyselves, Dwarfs, for my stipend will be demanding. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_VAMP_Mannfred_Dip_Dwarf_Acceptance_Neutral_02	I see. Ally with us, and I'll overlook the perceived notions of unfairness recorded in thine little book. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_VAMP_Mannfred_Dip_Dwarf_Acceptance_Positive_01	I take your pledge, Dwarf, ensure it is kept as thy reputation states. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_VAMP_Mannfred_Dip_Dwarf_Acceptance_Positive_02	Yesss, let's seal it in blood, even the dusty blood of thy Dwarfs will do!	false
diplomacy_strings_string_VAMP_Mannfred_Dip_Dwarf_Rejection_Negative_01	I'll have no such thing! Thou are creatures of deformed height, and I will spare thou no mercy! 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_VAMP_Mannfred_Dip_Dwarf_Rejection_Negative_02	Prepare, Dwarfs, for when I come for you I shall shave the beards of thy Unliving corpses! 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_VAMP_Mannfred_Dip_Dwarf_Rejection_Neutral_01	Thy beards must be interfering with thy heads, we will not ally with stunted hole-dwellers! 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_VAMP_Mannfred_Dip_Dwarf_Rejection_Neutral_02	I am von Carstein! You think I need the help of an atrophying empire to further my destiny! 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_VAMP_Mannfred_Dip_Dwarf_Rejection_Positive_01	Ha! I think not, stone-gatherer. I've had my fill of Dwarf bile this night. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_VAMP_Mannfred_Dip_Dwarf_Rejection_Positive_02	No, I grow weary of Dwarfs. Their blood tastes as dour as their mood.	false
diplomacy_strings_string_VAMP_Mannfred_Dip_Dwf_Greet_Neg_01	Speak thy insults, stuntling – let me hear thy pleas, for it is music to mine ears.  	false
diplomacy_strings_string_VAMP_Mannfred_Dip_Dwf_Greet_Neg_02	Dwarfs! Would that Nagash had wiped thy sorry race out when he had the wherewithal to do so! Speak then!	false
diplomacy_strings_string_VAMP_Mannfred_Dip_Dwf_Greet_Neu_01	So, the bothersome stone-gatherers come from their mountain-holes to plead for mercy? 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_VAMP_Mannfred_Dip_Dwf_Greet_Neu_02	I have no time for stunted-folk, they hold no interest. Dwarf-creature, hast thine words import?	false
diplomacy_strings_string_VAMP_Mannfred_Dip_Dwf_Greet_Pos_01	Stunted folk, I greet thee but do not presume too much.	false
diplomacy_strings_string_VAMP_Mannfred_Dip_Dwf_Greet_Pos_02	Dwarfs! Thy lives are reckoned long, but the grave is eternal!	false
diplomacy_strings_string_VAMP_Mannfred_Dip_Emp_Greet_Neu_01	The Emperor! A false title! Be careful what you say, mortal, for I am the true Emperor!	false
diplomacy_strings_string_VAMP_Mannfred_Dip_Emp_Greet_Neu_02	So, the sheep come to debate with the Shepard! Very well, deliver thy message. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_VAMP_Mannfred_Dip_Emp_Greet_Pos_01	Men of the hammer - tell me thine tales of woe and a true count of the realm shall appease them!	false
diplomacy_strings_string_VAMP_Mannfred_Dip_Emp_Greet_Pos_02	So, Volkmar sends thou to barter in his stead... What a delicious proposition.	false
diplomacy_strings_string_VAMP_Mannfred_Dip_Empire_Acceptance_Negative_01	I do this for Sylvania. Make no mistake, mortal fools, this grants thy a reprieve and nothing more. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_VAMP_Mannfred_Dip_Empire_Acceptance_Negative_02	These terms will have to suffice, but I'll seek proper redress in due course, mortals - have no fear about that! 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_VAMP_Mannfred_Dip_Empire_Acceptance_Neutral_01	I see no reason, as the true Count of Stirland, to add my levy to Franz' army.   	false
diplomacy_strings_string_VAMP_Mannfred_Dip_Empire_Acceptance_Neutral_02	Fine. The Undead and the living shall work as one. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_VAMP_Mannfred_Dip_Empire_Acceptance_Positive_01	Yes, as Lords of this realm it is our duty to work as one for the good of our nation… 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_VAMP_Mannfred_Dip_Empire_Acceptance_Positive_02	An accord then, thy commonfolk shall step in unison with mine own sleepless warriors. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_VAMP_Mannfred_Dip_Empire_Greeting_Negative_01	Dost the Heldenhammer know what wretched creatures hath sired in his stead? 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_VAMP_Mannfred_Dip_Empire_Greeting_Negative_02	Does Franz not dare to come before me and kneel? A coward then, as the Princes of Altdorf have ever been!	false
diplomacy_strings_string_VAMP_Mannfred_Dip_Empire_Rejection_Negative_01	Why would I, the greatest of all von Carsteins, deign to ally with my food?  	false
diplomacy_strings_string_VAMP_Mannfred_Dip_Empire_Rejection_Negative_02	Your decrepit Empire is not worthy to form a pact with my sleepless legions! I will see you all dead before I share the glory with the living! 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_VAMP_Mannfred_Dip_Empire_Rejection_Neutral_01	Haha, why should the herder have to treat with his cattle when he can whip them into obedience! 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_VAMP_Mannfred_Dip_Empire_Rejection_Neutral_02	If Vlad would not deign to treat with mortals of the Empire what makes thou think I will… 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_VAMP_Mannfred_Dip_Empire_Rejection_Positive_01	Franz oversteps his bounds! He is self-declared emperor of the living. My legions do not recognise his authority. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_VAMP_Mannfred_Dip_Empire_Rejection_Positive_02	No, as you stubbornly refuse my right to rule mine own lands, I refuse your notions of alliance.	false
diplomacy_strings_string_VAMP_Mannfred_Dip_Greenskin_Acceptance_Negative_01	To end civilisation then, Greenskin filth, but do not forget who is the master and who is the dog! 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_VAMP_Mannfred_Dip_Greenskin_Acceptance_Negative_02	A horde is a horde whether made from my servants or Greenskin beasts. It's purpose will be the same. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_VAMP_Mannfred_Dip_Greenskin_Acceptance_Neutral_01	Together, beast, we will hunt our prey. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_VAMP_Mannfred_Dip_Greenskin_Acceptance_Neutral_02	Then let the Orcs run rampant! My servants will be ready to pick through the corpses in the aftermath! 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_VAMP_Mannfred_Dip_Greenskin_Acceptance_Positive_01	Fine! If the Orcs want nought but war and death… then I will find it for them. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_VAMP_Mannfred_Dip_Greenskin_Acceptance_Positive_02	We will work with these green beasts. Let them be the scythe of our harvest. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_VAMP_Mannfred_Dip_Greenskin_Rejection_Negative_01	Get from my presence, creature! Thou are nothing but Strigoi fodder - to even suggest an alliance with mine bloodline is grave insult! 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_VAMP_Mannfred_Dip_Greenskin_Rejection_Negative_02	I think not, my legions will slay thy green beasts - I haven't the time or inclination to tame thou!  	false
diplomacy_strings_string_VAMP_Mannfred_Dip_Greenskin_Rejection_Neutral_01	My bloodline is of the highest nobility; to even consider an alliance with base creatures like these is an impiety too far! 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_VAMP_Mannfred_Dip_Greenskin_Rejection_Neutral_02	Get thee from my realm, creature! I will not even taste your blood, that should be the greatest offence of all! 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_VAMP_Mannfred_Dip_Greenskin_Rejection_Positive_01	Haha - a laughable notion. They are dim-witted beasts, we are regal lords - there's no common cause.  	false
diplomacy_strings_string_VAMP_Mannfred_Dip_Greenskin_Rejection_Positive_02	I don't think so, Greenskin. But please, keep killing the humans, their corpses make fine troops. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_VAMP_Mannfred_Dip_Greet_Neg_01	Mortals… thou hast trespassed. Thy words had best hold prominence or death will visit thee! 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_VAMP_Mannfred_Dip_Greet_Neg_02	Speak thy words and pray to thine pitiful little gods that they ring true! 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_VAMP_Mannfred_Dip_Greet_Neg_03	Do not underestimate the danger thou art in, mortal, mine patience wears thin for thy parley.  	false
diplomacy_strings_string_VAMP_Mannfred_Dip_Greet_Neu_01	The night grows long. I shall hear thee mortal, but talk is cheap! 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_VAMP_Mannfred_Dip_Greet_Neu_02	Don't stand there like some startled sheep! Deliver thy message, lamb, so I may consider a response.  	false
diplomacy_strings_string_VAMP_Mannfred_Dip_Greet_Neu_03	Welcome to mine realm. Let no man say otherwise! For it is *mine* lands you tread upon. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_VAMP_Mannfred_Dip_Greet_Pos_01	Welcome to my realm, mortal. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_VAMP_Mannfred_Dip_Greet_Pos_02	Greetings, thou stand before the rightful Elector of Stirland! 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_VAMP_Mannfred_Dip_Greet_Pos_03	Sylvania greets thee, friend...	false
diplomacy_strings_string_VAMP_Mannfred_Dip_Grnskn_Greet_Neg_01	I shall not ignore the forms - talk, beast, then I shall kill thee. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_VAMP_Mannfred_Dip_Grnskn_Greet_Neg_02	Orcs! I shall hear it out, and then I shall feast upon its bones should its' words displease me. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_VAMP_Mannfred_Dip_Grnskn_Greet_Neu_01	What, Greenskin? I am immortal and yet I have little time for thy guttural tones. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_VAMP_Mannfred_Dip_Grnskn_Greet_Neu_02	I have no interest in these green beasts, their blood tastes foul and they refuse to be dominated. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_VAMP_Mannfred_Dip_Grnskn_Greet_Pos_01	Talk to me beast, spit out thy base demand. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_VAMP_Mannfred_Dip_Grnskn_Greet_Pos_02	Greenskins! I have witnessed thy kind many times before, what could thou possibly offer me? 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_VAMP_Mannfred_Dip_Rejection_Negative_01	You forget thyself, mortal. I am a von Carstein! THE von Carstein. Thou will learn to respect that name, as thrall to my will! 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_VAMP_Mannfred_Dip_Rejection_Negative_02	Thy words are as meaningless as thine miserable life! 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_VAMP_Mannfred_Dip_Rejection_Negative_03	So careless, so insignificant - that is what you are to me, mortal insect! I refuse thy insolent offer.  	false
diplomacy_strings_string_VAMP_Mannfred_Dip_Rejection_Neutral_01	Ha-ha-ha, you think me dense, perhaps? Do not underestimate me… others have and paid with their souls. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_VAMP_Mannfred_Dip_Rejection_Neutral_02	The curse of my kind - I talk and negotiate with my food! Would men bargain with cattle? I think not. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_VAMP_Mannfred_Dip_Rejection_Neutral_03	I have heard what you have to say. I reject it, as I do all wants and desires of the living. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_VAMP_Mannfred_Dip_Rejection_Positive_01	Alas, with the blood moon hanging so low in the night sky… I must refuse.	false
diplomacy_strings_string_VAMP_Mannfred_Dip_Rejection_Positive_02	You would do well to withdraw… 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_VAMP_Mannfred_Dip_Rejection_Positive_03	No, mortals are so impatient. Consider thyself chastised. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_VAMP_Mannfred_Dip_Vamp_Greet_Neg_01	Now is not the time, for petty politics, mine brothers, mine kin! Any who defy mine will shall be destroyed!	false
diplomacy_strings_string_VAMP_Mannfred_Dip_Vamp_Greet_Neg_02	Come, but do not assume that as we share a blood line thou shalt not be shackled to mine will!	false
diplomacy_strings_string_VAMP_Mannfred_Dip_Vamp_Greet_Neu_01	Greetings, kin, mine will dominates here, do not mistake this parley for anything else! 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_VAMP_Mannfred_Dip_Vamp_Greet_Neu_02	Thou wish'st to entwine hordes? As head of the dynasty it shall be mine to command. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_VAMP_Mannfred_Dip_Vamp_Greet_Pos_01	Fellow beatless hearts, let us discuss the destruction of the living, yes?	false
diplomacy_strings_string_VAMP_Mannfred_Dip_Vamp_Greet_Pos_02	My kin, I am pleased thou attend'st me.  	false
diplomacy_strings_string_VAMP_Mannfred_Dip_Vampire_Acceptance_Negative_01	I am Lord and master, thou acknowledge this with the sundering of thy minions to me! 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_VAMP_Mannfred_Dip_Vampire_Acceptance_Negative_02	Let us make a bond on this, but I warn thou, to defy me will be thy greatest mistake! 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_VAMP_Mannfred_Dip_Vampire_Acceptance_Neutral_01	We have agreement, but make no mistake who leads this host! 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_VAMP_Mannfred_Dip_Vampire_Acceptance_Neutral_02	All fall beneath my will, thou are simply ushering in the inevitable. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_VAMP_Mannfred_Dip_Vampire_Acceptance_Positive_01	Yes, together our tireless legions will ensure Sylvania's expansion. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_VAMP_Mannfred_Dip_Vampire_Acceptance_Positive_02	Good, we share the spoils - the wide-eyed cattle - between us. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_VAMP_Mannfred_Dip_Vampire_Rejection_Negative_01	I am Mannfred, the greatest to bear the name von Carstein, thy host is insignificant to me! 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_VAMP_Mannfred_Dip_Vampire_Rejection_Negative_02	From the afterlife, even Nagash trembles at my name - do not think thou can challenge me. The mortals are all mine!  	false
diplomacy_strings_string_VAMP_Mannfred_Dip_Vampire_Rejection_Neutral_01	I think not, the death-tally will be mine and no other kin or Necromancer can claim it! 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_VAMP_Mannfred_Dip_Vampire_Rejection_Neutral_02	Fools! You are mere dabblers in death, I am Mannfred von Carstein, Morr's realm is mine!	false
diplomacy_strings_string_VAMP_Mannfred_Dip_Vampire_Rejection_Positive_01	No - my stock is superior, I do not wish to taint it with inferior pawns.   	false
diplomacy_strings_string_VAMP_Mannfred_Dip_Vampire_Rejection_Positive_02	Our goals suffer. Go, but best not cross my path again. It would prove thine downfall. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_VAMP_MasNec1_Dip_Acceptance_Negative_01	Yes, we have a pact, but do not interfere in my affairs… 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_VAMP_MasNec1_Dip_Acceptance_Negative_02	Agreed, though there is an imprudent streak in you. Perhaps I shall have the Crypt Ghouls beat it out?	false
diplomacy_strings_string_VAMP_MasNec1_Dip_Acceptance_Negative_03	Yes, sign your precious parchments - as if it means anything to me! 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_VAMP_MasNec1_Dip_Acceptance_Neutral_01	I agree - now the delicate issue of remuneration… it won’t be something as crude as gold that I need. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_VAMP_MasNec1_Dip_Acceptance_Neutral_02	That is what we agreed. Now leave me to my works. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_VAMP_MasNec1_Dip_Acceptance_Neutral_03	We have a deal. Prepare the tombs, I require ingress. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_VAMP_MasNec1_Dip_Acceptance_Positive_01	Good-good, when do we begin? 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_VAMP_MasNec1_Dip_Acceptance_Positive_02	Very good, you will not regret this - you'll see! 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_VAMP_MasNec1_Dip_Acceptance_Positive_03	Yes, this is the right course of action - my servants will start preparations right away! 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_VAMP_MasNec1_Dip_Bret_Greet_Neg_01	What demands are you to make, envoy of a fettered king? 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_VAMP_MasNec1_Dip_Bret_Greet_Neg_02	Make your offer, then go and tell the Enchantress-hag her nation is dead!  	false
diplomacy_strings_string_VAMP_MasNec1_Dip_Bret_Greet_Neu_01	Come Bretonnians, tell me, what can you possibly offer this humble conjurer? 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_VAMP_MasNec1_Dip_Bret_Greet_Neu_02	I'll hear what you have to say, only when I'm ready Bretonnian!	false
diplomacy_strings_string_VAMP_MasNec1_Dip_Bret_Greet_Pos_01	So, Bretonnian, I am here, are you ready to make a pact. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_VAMP_MasNec1_Dip_Bret_Greet_Pos_02	I'm glad you are here, Knight, we can work together but my price is your low-born. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_VAMP_MasNec1_Dip_Bretonnia_Acceptance_Negative_01	Yes, your puppet-king will surrender to me! 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_VAMP_MasNec1_Dip_Bretonnia_Acceptance_Negative_02	The terms are signed, you cannot back out of it now - watch your country wither!  	false
diplomacy_strings_string_VAMP_MasNec1_Dip_Bretonnia_Acceptance_Neutral_01	Very good - once you have come round to my way of thinking, you'll realise that this is the right course.	false
diplomacy_strings_string_VAMP_MasNec1_Dip_Bretonnia_Acceptance_Neutral_02	Ha! Those pesky morals, eh? Yes discard them, or hide behind some greater 'chivalrous' notion! 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_VAMP_MasNec1_Dip_Bretonnia_Acceptance_Positive_01	Yes, Bretonnian, we shall work together. There are so many crypts, so many barrows in your lands! 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_VAMP_MasNec1_Dip_Bretonnia_Acceptance_Positive_02	Good, Morr is weak in your nation. We have agreement. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_VAMP_MasNec1_Dip_Bretonnia_Rejection_Negative_01	You have nothing, Bretonnian. What could I possibly want in your fetid mudhole of a country?	false
diplomacy_strings_string_VAMP_MasNec1_Dip_Bretonnia_Rejection_Negative_02	Fair Bretonnia is fair no more - tell the lake hags that I will take what I need! 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_VAMP_MasNec1_Dip_Bretonnia_Rejection_Neutral_01	No, Bretonnian, that water sprite you claim as a god takes against honest folk such as I. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_VAMP_MasNec1_Dip_Bretonnia_Rejection_Neutral_02	A kingdom of fools is soon separated from the lands to which it lays claim.	false
diplomacy_strings_string_VAMP_MasNec1_Dip_Bretonnia_Rejection_Positive_01	I don't think so. Your king doesn't appreciate my arts. Ask those in Mousillon. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_VAMP_MasNec1_Dip_Bretonnia_Rejection_Positive_02	No… I am busy elsewhere, Bretonnia holds nothing for me. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_VAMP_MasNec1_Dip_Chaos_Acceptance_Negative_01	Very well, tell your Everchosen we have a deal. If he betrays me, we'll see how chosen he truly is. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_VAMP_MasNec1_Dip_Chaos_Acceptance_Negative_02	So be it, Northman, but my rights to the dead are sacrosanct! 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_VAMP_MasNec1_Dip_Chaos_Acceptance_Neutral_01	I ascent to your demands, Chaos creature, but my soul is mine own to damn - you cannot claim it. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_VAMP_MasNec1_Dip_Chaos_Acceptance_Neutral_02	Good - my tireless hordes are at your disposal - you have my fee? 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_VAMP_MasNec1_Dip_Chaos_Acceptance_Positive_01	Yes, start your killing, Northman, but leave the bodies for me! 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_VAMP_MasNec1_Dip_Chaos_Acceptance_Positive_02	Good, the pact is signed. You may have my soul of course - not that it will ever leave this body! 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_VAMP_MasNec1_Dip_Chaos_Greet_Neg_01	Archaon 'the ever-fool', does that not sound a more accurate title? I'd agree if you wish to flatter me into an alliance? Yes?	false
diplomacy_strings_string_VAMP_MasNec1_Dip_Chaos_Greet_Neg_02	I will hear your grovelling pleas 'get of spawn' but you have no power over me! 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_VAMP_MasNec1_Dip_Chaos_Greet_Neu_01	So Chaos-minion, you come to parley with life-givers and dead-takers, you must need something? 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_VAMP_MasNec1_Dip_Chaos_Greet_Neu_02	Go on then, deliver your Gods' message - but remember, threats won't work against me.	false
diplomacy_strings_string_VAMP_MasNec1_Dip_Chaos_Greet_Pos_01	Chaos, I admire your Gods, although they are too focused on capturing souls when the vessels have far more use. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_VAMP_MasNec1_Dip_Chaos_Greet_Pos_02	Well, well - what could such powerful figures as yourselves want with me and my humble arts? 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_VAMP_MasNec1_Dip_Chaos_Rejection_Negative_01	I have no time, nor will I, to entertain Chaos scum. Go away! 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_VAMP_MasNec1_Dip_Chaos_Rejection_Negative_02	Be gone, Chaos spawn, or I will turn you to dust! 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_VAMP_MasNec1_Dip_Chaos_Rejection_Neutral_01	I think not, tell Archaon to find another pet Necromancer! 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_VAMP_MasNec1_Dip_Chaos_Rejection_Neutral_02	No, and your attempts at intimidation are laughable, really. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_VAMP_MasNec1_Dip_Chaos_Rejection_Positive_01	No, Chaos, I have masters feared more than yours could ever be.	false
diplomacy_strings_string_VAMP_MasNec1_Dip_Chaos_Rejection_Positive_02	No - I serve other, more powerful beings. Death holds no fear, I crave it! 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_VAMP_MasNec1_Dip_Dwarf_Acceptance_Negative_01	Well, well, so the Dwarfs do swallow their pride when they need to? What a delightfully bitter pill, yes?  	false
diplomacy_strings_string_VAMP_MasNec1_Dip_Dwarf_Acceptance_Negative_02	A Necromancer saving the Karaz Ankor. Ha, I bet this really sticks in your craw, Dwarfs.	false
diplomacy_strings_string_VAMP_MasNec1_Dip_Dwarf_Acceptance_Neutral_01	We have agreement - I take it you do not wish for the rest of the Karaz Ankor to know? 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_VAMP_MasNec1_Dip_Dwarf_Acceptance_Neutral_02	A fair exchange of goods, but do not threaten me again, Dwarf or I'll see you as a shambling lackey.	false
diplomacy_strings_string_VAMP_MasNec1_Dip_Dwarf_Acceptance_Positive_01	I accept, Dwarfs. I'll need access to your crypts, of course. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_VAMP_MasNec1_Dip_Dwarf_Acceptance_Positive_02	Good, then we can begin. I require Runelore. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_VAMP_MasNec1_Dip_Dwarf_Rejection_Negative_01	Stick me in your pitiful little grudge book, Dwarfs. See if I care! You'll pay the price either way! 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_VAMP_MasNec1_Dip_Dwarf_Rejection_Negative_02	No, Dwarfs, no - the only bargain to be made now is when you beg for the corpses of your kin!	false
diplomacy_strings_string_VAMP_MasNec1_Dip_Dwarf_Rejection_Neutral_01	I don't need your baubles or promises Dwarf. It will be all there to take in time. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_VAMP_MasNec1_Dip_Dwarf_Rejection_Neutral_02	Go and cower in your mountains, Dawi, my legions will come to your door soon enough. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_VAMP_MasNec1_Dip_Dwarf_Rejection_Positive_01	I think not, you Dwarfs have such a temper. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_VAMP_MasNec1_Dip_Dwarf_Rejection_Positive_02	No stunted creature, I have no interest in your… kind. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_VAMP_MasNec1_Dip_Dwf_Greet_Neg_01	What, Dwarfs? Should I animate your ancestors and have them hack off your beards?	false
diplomacy_strings_string_VAMP_MasNec1_Dip_Dwf_Greet_Neg_02	I find your persistence tiring, stone-gatherer, perhaps a display of my power will get the respect I deserve! 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_VAMP_MasNec1_Dip_Dwf_Greet_Neu_01	Ahh, bearded folk, are you not blind, do you not see your domains are surely doomed? 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_VAMP_MasNec1_Dip_Dwf_Greet_Neu_02	Hail Dwarf! Times must be desperate indeed for Grudgebearer and his ilk to send his peons my way!	false
diplomacy_strings_string_VAMP_MasNec1_Dip_Dwf_Greet_Pos_01	No need for Reikspiel, Dwarf, I speak perfect Khazalid, how else would I raise your kin back from the dead?	false
diplomacy_strings_string_VAMP_MasNec1_Dip_Dwf_Greet_Pos_02	Stunted folk, your race is thin on the ground of late, perhaps I could help? 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_VAMP_MasNec1_Dip_Emp_Greet_Neg_01	Do go on - threaten me with Helborg or Schwarzhelm's wrath if you must, it makes no difference. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_VAMP_MasNec1_Dip_Emp_Greet_Neg_02	Such insolence, do you think your pitiful lost god can save you? Utter your message and be quick!	false
diplomacy_strings_string_VAMP_MasNec1_Dip_Emp_Greet_Neu_01	Poor Sigmarite fools, I almost feel sorry for you, almost… 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_VAMP_MasNec1_Dip_Emp_Greet_Neu_02	Ha! You think making pacts with Daemon-spawn is dangerous, Reiklander, I have yet to state my terms… 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_VAMP_MasNec1_Dip_Emp_Greet_Pos_01	The Empire, bah! Such nuisances with your Witch Hunters and your Priests of Morr! 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_VAMP_MasNec1_Dip_Emp_Greet_Pos_02	Greetings, envoys of Ulric and Sigmar, I trust you haven't come to kill me - yet - then what do you want?	false
diplomacy_strings_string_VAMP_MasNec1_Dip_Empire_Acceptance_Negative_01	Fine, but I'll slay any of Morr's priests that I see skulking around my domain. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_VAMP_MasNec1_Dip_Empire_Acceptance_Negative_02	Good, you accept the inevitable, that is the first step in your nation's doom. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_VAMP_MasNec1_Dip_Empire_Acceptance_Neutral_01	Very well, but tell the Grand Theogonist to rein in his Witch Hunter dogs.	false
diplomacy_strings_string_VAMP_MasNec1_Dip_Empire_Acceptance_Neutral_02	Agreed, but I'll need assurances that some Sigmarite fool won't blunder in to ruin it!	false
diplomacy_strings_string_VAMP_MasNec1_Dip_Empire_Acceptance_Positive_01	Very well - you have my list of requirements, just don't tell the Witch Hunters.	false
diplomacy_strings_string_VAMP_MasNec1_Dip_Empire_Acceptance_Positive_02	We have a pact then, Sigmarite. Good, good. I assume that the Theogonist knows nothing? 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_VAMP_MasNec1_Dip_Empire_Rejection_Negative_01	No, the Empire will fall - Franz's corpse will be mine willing servant! 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_VAMP_MasNec1_Dip_Empire_Rejection_Negative_02	I think not! The Heldenhammer is tarnished, the reign of the dead begins! 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_VAMP_MasNec1_Dip_Empire_Rejection_Neutral_01	No, Empire fools, close your Gardens of Morr if you must, the tombs will still open for me!	false
diplomacy_strings_string_VAMP_MasNec1_Dip_Empire_Rejection_Neutral_02	Foolish mortals, do not trouble me with your earthly concerns! 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_VAMP_MasNec1_Dip_Empire_Rejection_Positive_01	No, I know your sort. You'll betray me to the Silver Hammer! 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_VAMP_MasNec1_Dip_Empire_Rejection_Positive_02	I think not, Reiklander. My arts are for my own gain and no-one else's! 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_VAMP_MasNec1_Dip_Greenskin_Acceptance_Negative_01	Come then, Orc, send your hordes and I will deign to bring you prey. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_VAMP_MasNec1_Dip_Greenskin_Acceptance_Negative_02	Yes, creature, but raise your crude blades to me and I'll see you wither before mine eyes! 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_VAMP_MasNec1_Dip_Greenskin_Acceptance_Neutral_01	Yes, it will be a challenge, but I can work with such crude materials I suppose. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_VAMP_MasNec1_Dip_Greenskin_Acceptance_Neutral_02	Accept the terms, Orc, then the reign of terror will begin! 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_VAMP_MasNec1_Dip_Greenskin_Acceptance_Positive_01	Yes, yes, we shall work together, I only ask that you don’t mutilate the bodies too much. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_VAMP_MasNec1_Dip_Greenskin_Acceptance_Positive_02	Agreed. Sign in blood, Orc, and we will begin. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_VAMP_MasNec1_Dip_Greenskin_Rejection_Negative_01	Leave me, creature, or you will be returned as Crypt Ghoul fodder. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_VAMP_MasNec1_Dip_Greenskin_Rejection_Negative_02	Gah! Get out of my sight, Orc, or your armies will be nothing but ashes in the foetid winds!	false
diplomacy_strings_string_VAMP_MasNec1_Dip_Greenskin_Rejection_Neutral_01	No, beast, you will not interfere with my plans. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_VAMP_MasNec1_Dip_Greenskin_Rejection_Neutral_02	What kind of sorcerer do you take me for? I have no use for your… offer, Greenskin! 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_VAMP_MasNec1_Dip_Greenskin_Rejection_Positive_01	No, your crude bodies hold no interest for me, Orc. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_VAMP_MasNec1_Dip_Greenskin_Rejection_Positive_02	I'm afraid not, beast, your kind offer no challenge. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_VAMP_MasNec1_Dip_Greet_Neg_01	What? Who dares disturb my great works!? 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_VAMP_MasNec1_Dip_Greet_Neg_02	It is a imbecilic thing to bother me - others who have, end up as my puppets!	false
diplomacy_strings_string_VAMP_MasNec1_Dip_Greet_Neg_03	Speak now, then go, or my Zombies will pull out your tongues! 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_VAMP_MasNec1_Dip_Greet_Neu_01	Is this what you truly want, mortal - my gift or my wrath?	false
diplomacy_strings_string_VAMP_MasNec1_Dip_Greet_Neu_02	Hmm, there are possibilities here, oh yes - but first we must negotiate. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_VAMP_MasNec1_Dip_Greet_Neu_03	Salutations! We have an issue don't we? Perhaps I can resolve it for a cost we can both agree on. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_VAMP_MasNec1_Dip_Greet_Pos_01	Greetings, let me rid you of those corpses that crowd your fields and cemeteries. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_VAMP_MasNec1_Dip_Greet_Pos_02	Oh dear, that smells like grave-rot - an unfortunate disease - perhaps I could supply a cure? 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_VAMP_MasNec1_Dip_Greet_Pos_03	No, I'm not dead, my heart still beats. But am I mortal? Well, that's a different question entirely! 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_VAMP_MasNec1_Dip_Grnskn_Greet_Neg_01	So, Orc, speak quickly! The grave-bound call to me, I have no time for you. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_VAMP_MasNec1_Dip_Grnskn_Greet_Neg_02	Make an offer but if I don't like it, I'll have your skin sloughed from your bones by Banshee screams. 	false

diplomacy_strings_string_VAMP_MasNec2_Dip_Bret_Greet_Pos_01	So, Bretonnian, I am here, are you ready to make a pact. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_VAMP_MasNec2_Dip_Bret_Greet_Pos_02	I'm glad you are here, Knight, we can work together but my price is your low-born. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_VAMP_MasNec2_Dip_Chaos_Greet_Neg_01	Archaon 'the ever-fool' does that not sound a more accurate title? I'd agree if you wish to flatter me into an alliance? Yes?	false
diplomacy_strings_string_VAMP_MasNec2_Dip_Chaos_Greet_Neg_02	I will hear your grovelling pleas 'get of spawn' but you have no power over me! 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_VAMP_MasNec2_Dip_Chaos_Greet_Neu_01	So Chaos-minion, you come to parley with life-givers and dead-takers, you must need something? 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_VAMP_MasNec2_Dip_Chaos_Greet_Neu_02	Go on then, deliver your Gods' message - but remember, threats won't work against me.	false
diplomacy_strings_string_VAMP_MasNec2_Dip_Chaos_Greet_Pos_01	Chaos, I admire your Gods, although they are too focused on capturing souls when the vessels have far more use. 	false

diplomacy_strings_string_VAMP_MasNec2_Dip_Dwf_Greet_Neg_01	What, Dwarfs? Should I animate your ancestors and have them hack off your beards?	false
diplomacy_strings_string_VAMP_MasNec2_Dip_Dwf_Greet_Neg_02	I find your persistence tiring, stone-gatherer, perhaps a display of my power will get the respect I deserve! 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_VAMP_MasNec2_Dip_Dwf_Greet_Neu_01	Ahh, bearded folk, are you not blind, do you not see your domains are surely doomed? 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_VAMP_MasNec2_Dip_Dwf_Greet_Neu_02	Hail Dwarf! Times must be desperate indeed for Grudgebearer and his ilk to send his peons my way!	false

diplomacy_strings_string_VAMP_MasNec2_Dip_Emp_Greet_Neg_01	Do go on - threaten me with Helborg or Schwarzhelm's wrath if you must, it makes no difference. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_VAMP_MasNec2_Dip_Emp_Greet_Neg_02	Such insolence, do you think your pitiful lost god can save you? Utter your message and be quick!	false

diplomacy_strings_string_VAMP_MasNec2_Dip_Greet_Neg_01	What? Who dares disturb my great works!? 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_VAMP_MasNec2_Dip_Greet_Neg_02	It is a imbecilic thing to bother me - others who have, end up as my puppets!	false
diplomacy_strings_string_VAMP_MasNec2_Dip_Greet_Neg_03	Speak now, then go, or my Zombies will pull out your tongues! 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_VAMP_MasNec2_Dip_Greet_Neu_01	Is this what you truly want, mortal - my gift or my wrath?	false

diplomacy_strings_string_wh_dlc07_BRET_Fey_Dip_Greenskin_Greeting_Neg_02	I will see that you pay for your wanton destruction!	false
diplomacy_strings_string_wh_dlc07_BRET_Fey_Dip_Greenskin_Greeting_Neu_01	If you wish me to hear your braying you had better kneel.	false
diplomacy_strings_string_wh_dlc07_BRET_Fey_Dip_Greenskin_Greeting_Neu_02	In that wizened shell you call a heart is nought but destruction. 	false
diplomacy_strings_string_wh_dlc07_BRET_Fey_Dip_Greenskin_Greeting_Pos_01	Grant me patience, my Lady, here come the Greenskins.	false

diplomacy_strings_string_wh_dlc07_BRET_Fey_Dip_Greenskin_Rejection_Positive_02	I will not take this accord; it does not meet the needs of Bretonnia.	false
diplomacy_strings_string_wh_dlc07_BRET_Fey_Dip_Greeting_Neg_01	Those who displease me do not live to tell of it…	false
diplomacy_strings_string_wh_dlc07_BRET_Fey_Dip_Greeting_Neg_02	No evildoer may receive the blessings of the Lady.	false
diplomacy_strings_string_wh_dlc07_BRET_Fey_Dip_Greeting_Neg_03	Dark are these times and dark my mood.	false
diplomacy_strings_string_wh_dlc07_BRET_Fey_Dip_Greeting_Neu_01	Past, present, future, 'tis but a thin veil that divides them.	false

diplomacy_strings_string_wh_dlc07_BRET_Fey_Dip_Vampire_Acceptance_Neutral_02	Bretonnia will take this deal, but your kind will never be welcome here.	false
diplomacy_strings_string_wh_dlc07_BRET_Fey_Dip_Vampire_Acceptance_Positive_01	This is an unusually good deal, yet I remain suspicious of you.	false
diplomacy_strings_string_wh_dlc07_BRET_Fey_Dip_Vampire_Acceptance_Positive_02	Though your kind is forever unwelcome, this deal is most acceptable.	false
diplomacy_strings_string_wh_dlc07_BRET_Fey_Dip_Vampire_Greeting_Neg_01	Spawn of darkness, I have no words for you!	false
diplomacy_strings_string_wh_dlc07_BRET_Fey_Dip_Vampire_Greeting_Neg_02	Your kind has wrought great suffering upon Bretonnia, I shall see you repaid.	false
diplomacy_strings_string_wh_dlc07_BRET_Fey_Dip_Vampire_Greeting_Neu_01	I may serve the Lady, but my will is still my own, Vampire.	false
diplomacy_strings_string_wh_dlc07_BRET_Fey_Dip_Vampire_Greeting_Neu_02	The Undead, how unpleasant…	false
diplomacy_strings_string_wh_dlc07_BRET_Fey_Dip_Vampire_Greeting_Pos_01	Oh joy, the von Carsteins seek my counsel...	false

diplomacy_strings_string_wh_dlc07_BRET_Fey_Dip_Vampire_Rejection_Negative_01	No, take your foulness and fly from this place; there shall be no deal.	false
diplomacy_strings_string_wh_dlc07_BRET_Fey_Dip_Vampire_Rejection_Negative_02	No amount of sweet words could convince me to align with your corruption.	false
diplomacy_strings_string_wh_dlc07_BRET_Fey_Dip_Vampire_Rejection_Neutral_01	The Lady is displeased, and so am I. The answer is no.	false
diplomacy_strings_string_wh_dlc07_BRET_Fey_Dip_Vampire_Rejection_Neutral_02	I decline your offer, and also you. It is time you were gone.	false
diplomacy_strings_string_wh_dlc07_BRET_Fey_Dip_Vampire_Rejection_Positive_01	You have tried admirable, but I cannot consider this a good deal for Bretonnia.	false
diplomacy_strings_string_wh_dlc07_BRET_Fey_Dip_Vampire_Rejection_Positive_02	No, Dark Lord; though you have been civil, this deal is not acceptable.	false
