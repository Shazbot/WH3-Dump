incidents_localised_description_wh2_dlc10_monster_hunt_8_stage_2	The Dark Elf merchant is suspiciously pleased to receive the Norse, venturing that he will be a willing buyer should they retrieve the corpse of the 'Mother of the Flame'. He points to the extinguished pinion that is sat upon a dais guarded by two Druchii warriors. He cautions that this will be no easy hunt. Legend has it, the Phoenix is a creature of Hekarti, existing between the mortal plane and in the Realm of Chaos. It only makes its appearance on the side of the mortal veil rarely, once a century at most. It is 'awoken' into this world through the heart of a burning volcano.\\n\\nAccording to the Dark Elf, that is the time to strike.

His bodyguards are quickly - painfully - put to the sword. Naturally, the Dark Elf wretch tells all you need to know; Vaul's Anvil is where the Mother of the Flame is due to be reborn. You don't even flinch at the wet crack as the Ice Wolf bites through his spinal cord.\\n\\nYour reputation with other Dark Elves will surely be damaged by such an aggressive act, but all you care about is the hunt!	false
incidents_localised_description_wh2_dlc10_monster_hunt_9_stage_2	While the slavers of the Point are some of the meanest and cruellest men upon Lustria's coast, even they pale to the  mighty Norse Chieftains. The merchants grovel at your feet, desperate to appease you and your retinue out of a pathetic fear of what will happen if they earn your displeasure. Gold is given as tribute.\\n\\nAt first they draw a blank on a willing guide - they are coast-huggers who rarely venture into the jungle interior. Then, one of the slave-masters dares make a suggestion. He leads you to a cage, in which a small reptile with a blue crest hisses defiantly.

Yet, as they had slowly replaced the living and brought her victory after victory, Saltspite grew less concerned. Now she struggled to remember when she had last spoken to someone with breath and not seawater in their lungs.\\n\\nWho needs friends when you have power? That is what her uncle had told her anyway… for, of late, Manann spoke to her less and less. But there was another who filled that void; this one spoke of storms and sharks, and glorified her as the ultimate predator. He would take care of his niece and together they would rule the waves.	false
incidents_localised_description_wh2_dlc11_incident_epilogue_cst_cylostra	All the world is a stage and Cylostra had given her ultimate performance. Her prize, the Merwyrm of the High Elves, Amanar. Good! They stole her life, so she took from them Lothern’s guardian. Yet now their precious Vortex quivers, Ulthuan shall sink and she will sing to the Phoenix King as he chokes on seawater!\\n\\nBathing in the adoration of her mindless, groaning crew, she was temporarily oblivious when a visitor appeared upon the deck of the Lamprey. It was a thing of rags, incorporeal and long-dead.\\n\\n"Enchantress," it whispered in greeting with an unearthly hiss. Cylostra flexed her flabellum to hide her face.\\n\\n"Who addresses Madame-Captain Direfin?" she asked in her most self-important voice. \\n\\n"I come at the behest of my master," said the ghostly emissary. "He asks if you desire a return to Bretonnia? Where he has been working against the living for some time and could use a spirit of such prodigious talent."\\n\\nThe Madame-Captain inspected her silvery form in the mirror as she considered a response.\\n\\n"A patron," she mused. "And who is it that shows such interest in moi?"\\n\\n"Like you, mistress, he is an Enchanter, and a great one no less. He has gone under many names over the centuries. At this time, he is only known as 'The Nameless'."	false
incidents_localised_description_wh2_dlc11_incident_epilogue_cst_harkon	It was done. The Merwyrm was slain by the empowered Star-metal Harpoon; a testament to the monster-killing lineage of the Wulfharts. Now the beast was resurrected and in thrall to Harkon, the Vampire Coast would expand and Luthor would be a force in the wider world once more.\\n\\nThis was no mere idle boast, for his mind had finally begun to align - the choir in his head would still bicker and rage on occasion, but were held in awe to a new voice, one that spoke with the wisdom of eons, as if it was older than Harkon even. It promised to guide Luthor and bring about an Undead empires to dwarf the current pretenders, especially the petty vassal-fiefdom of the von Carsteins. And when all that was achieved, the voice swore Harkon would be worthy of the greatest prize - to be at the right hand of a new Death-God… to be a Mortarch. \\n\\nLuthor Harkon will not be on the periphery when the End Times come!	false
incidents_localised_description_wh2_dlc11_incident_epilogue_cst_noctilus	Stood upon the deck of the Bloody Reaver, Count Noctilus looked out across the sea. If he were still living, he may have taken a deep breath, but those days of heartbeats and warm blood were long gone. Nevertheless, still cursed with a mortal’s desires, Noctilus could not hide his pleasure. Amanar was his; a gargantuan corpse enthused with Necromantic energy to wield against his foes.\\n\\nHe would continue to expand his network of coves and burgeoning empire outwards from the Galleon’s Graveyard, for there was still much power to be sought. Let the other fools battle for the Vortex, he would feed the skull-strewn Maelstrom with soul-power, and when it was ready, he would sail the Bloody Reaver into it. Then the Count could ply the seas of time, go anywhere or any-when; it was the ancestors of Jaego Roth who had the most to fear, for he would hunt them all down. History itself will not be safe from Nyklaus von Carstein!	false

incidents_localised_description_wh2_dlc13_wulfhart_hertwig_van_hal_stage_1_incident	While following a trail through the dense jungle canopy you stumbled upon a clearing strewn with dead bodies. They looked like seafarers, senior admiralty of some sort perhaps, but stranger still was the fact that each had a stake through the chest and was decapitated. On closer inspection you realised they were already dead before they met this gruesome fate – in fact, not dead, but Undead. Vampires...\\n\\nA few nights later, a mysterious man emerged from the jungle, introducing himself as Hertwig van Hal. His garb indicated he was a Witch Hunter of the Empire, but he revealed himself to be the healer you have been seeking. Explaining your cause to him, you asked him to join the expedition. He accepted, but on one condition – that you help him with his own mission in Lustria in return.	false
incidents_localised_description_wh2_dlc13_wulfhart_hertwig_van_hal_stage_2_incident	Hertwig returns to you in good spirits and renewed focus, explaining that he now has a solid lead in his search. The Vampire he seeks is one of the infamous Pirate King’s closest henchmen, who actively haunts the waters of the Vampire Coast to raise more potential recruits into his master's zombie crews. To find him, some raiding may be necessary...	false
incidents_localised_description_wh2_dlc13_wulfhart_hertwig_van_hal_stage_3_incident	You helped van Hal by plundering several of the Vampire Coast’s smuggling encampments and moored galleons along the coast, so the expedition quickly gained the attentions of the Pirate King’s senior henchmen. Alistair the Red still did not reveal himself, however. After interrogating, staking, and decapitating several of the Vampire Admirals sent against the expedition, Hertwig finally obtained the location of his target’s hiding place – The Awakening, an old coastal settlement of the dead rumoured to be home to the Pirate King himself.	false

incidents_localised_description_wh2_dlc13_wulfhart_jorek_grimm_stage_1_incident	Finally, contact was made with the Spine of Sotek Dwarfs. They are a strange lot, and it took quite some time for you to convince them your intentions were not belligerent. Once you described who you were seeking, the throng's leaders told you it sounded very much like the Master Engineer Jorek Grimm, a secretive Dwarf who has spent long periods of time outside their Hold. It was unclear to his kin what Jorek was doing on his forays, nor did they bother to ask.\\n\\nAfter being introduced to Jorek, he agreed to join your cause, but something tells you this eccentric Dwarf's services may cost you a little more than a mercenary’s reckoning.	false
incidents_localised_description_wh2_dlc13_wulfhart_jorek_grimm_stage_2_incident	To Jorek’s delight, you managed to fill a large crate with the materials he suggested, dropping it before him. He scurried away, dragging the crate behind him while rambling about the brilliance of his plans and how much he will accomplish. A few days later he emerges from his makeshift workshop, sweaty and beaming, proudly holding his latest invention.	false
incidents_localised_description_wh2_dlc13_wulfhart_jorek_grimm_stage_3_incident	The Master Engineer Jorek Grimm is a prolific inventor indeed!

incidents_localised_description_wh2_dlc13_wulfhart_jorek_grimm_stage_4_incident	After you secured the area containing the obsinite, Jorek immediately got to work.

incidents_localised_description_wh2_dlc13_wulfhart_kalara_stage_1_incident	Your activities in Lustria gained more than just the attention of angry locals. One day, as the expedition marched through the jungle following another successful offensive, you were suddenly threatened by a hooded figure standing in the trees above the jungle trail. After you introduced yourself as the Huntsmarshal – the Emperor’s Chief Scout – she descended and revealed herself to be a former Waystalker of Athel Loren, a Wood Elf huntress named Kalara. Around her neck hung a Bastiladon tooth, and it was clear from her appearance that she was a weathered warrior of the jungle.\\n\\nKalara asked you if you might help her track one particular beast she had been pursuing in Lustria. Not being one to turn down a hunt, you agreed – but only in return for lending her skills to your expedition.	false
incidents_localised_description_wh2_dlc13_wulfhart_kalara_stage_2_incident	Kalara has finally managed to pick up a trail. There have been a rash of slaughters that have seen entire regiments of men massacred deep in the jungle of late and she is convinced her target is responsible.\\n\\nKalara is eager for the expedition to investigate. Having fought alongside the expedition for an extended duration, she has also primed her skills for war and fashioned a new weapon for herself for use in the coming hunt.	false
incidents_localised_description_wh2_dlc13_wulfhart_kalara_stage_3_incident	The evidence you observed yourself at the ruins does make it seem plausible that the men were slaughtered by some sort of beast. Still, the use of weapons of war could also not be conclusively ruled out. Kalara’s resolve is strong, however, and you feel compelled to believe her. After all, the hunting senses of a Waystalker are not to be underestimated.	false
incidents_localised_description_wh2_dlc13_wulfhart_kalara_stage_4_incident	The beast was not found, but Kalara still refused to give up. By now you will have ascertained that there are several beasts in the jungles of these lands that appear cognisant when they shouldn’t, or larger than their normal counterparts. Privately, you know this is the reason that Kalara has been here for so long – there are just so many candidates that could feasibly contain the soul of her lover - it could be literally any of them.\\n\\nThough Kalara’s passion to slay an enormous beast has not wavered since you met her, you do not think you can continue without the truth laid clearly upon the table…	false
incidents_localised_description_wh2_dlc13_wulfhart_kalara_stage_5_incident	Once the area surrounding the Emerald Pools was secured, you helped Kalara construct her shrine to Isha right upon the banks of its glowing viridian waters. She then spent several days praying at the newly-built sanctum, beseeching the goddess to fulfil her promise to free Atherin’s soul from its eternal reincarnation.\\n\\nWhen Kalara finally emerged, it was clear that her prayers had been answered. Her usual sorrowful demeanour had vanished, for Isha had granted the lovers forgiveness and arranged for Atherin's soul to progress into the afterlife, thus freeing Kalara from her eternal hunt.\\n\\nKalara thanked you profoundly for your help and promised that as long as she was needed, she would continue fighting alongside the expedition.	false

incidents_localised_description_wh2_dlc13_wulfhart_rodrik_languille_stage_1_incident	Once you'd brought your forces to mists surrounding the temple-city of Xlanhuapec it did not take long for the Bretonnian swordsman to arrive at your camp. He revealed himself as being no mere soldier, but in fact a noble by the name of Rodrik L’Anguille who'd seen his entire retinue slaughtered whilst on an expedition into Lustria. With the massacre of his men, Rodrik was now without an army or indeed a purpose. With a vengeful tone in his voice, he told you he was willing to offer his knowledge of Xlanhuapec’s defences to enable a successful siege by your force, which of course you accepted.	false
incidents_localised_description_wh2_dlc13_wulfhart_rodrik_languille_stage_3_incident	Rodrik had already spent several moons with the expedition before coming to you with some dire news. His friends back home had managed to send word that those with grudges against him had become aware he was still alive in Lustria. One known as Lord Tudual not only wished for Rodrik not to return, but also that he be put to death. A small force has been sent to assassinate Rodrik!\\n\\nHowever, Rodrik has been tipped off about the location of where Lord Tudual’s force will be landing – Pox Marsh. He has beseeched you to move the expedition to intercept them immediately, to which you naturally agreed.	false

You have assumed the duke has given up – after all, Lustria is such a large and untamed land that it can easily drain the resources of any force sent against a single man, especially one who knows the land like Rodrik now does.

incidents_localised_description_wh2_dlc14_incident_brt_repanse_deserts_ruler	The dead have long laboured under the misapprehension that they are entitled to power and property.

That is why Bretonnia risked good men's lives to capture one of their snickering 'kings', and took the bone-fiend's head as its Unliving followers looked on.

incidents_localised_description_wh2_dlc16_incident_wef_avelorn_invaded	A messenger from Avelorn, court of the Everqueen Alarielle, has arrived with dire news. A mighty host of Chaos has invaded their kingdom and seeks to burn it to the ground. The Daemon-worshippers’ masters thirst for Asur souls, but more than that they seek to annihilate the heirs of Aenarion and destroy the Vortex that prevents their return. Alarielle has hastily opened up the Worldroots pathway to Avelorn and beseeches you for aid.	false
incidents_localised_description_wh2_dlc16_incident_wef_beastmen_threaten_kings_glade	Responding to the monstrous war cries of a bloodthirsty Beastlord, a braying horde of Beastmen has been spotted slowly amassing at the edge of the forest. There may be no rhyme or reason for them to congregate in such a manner, but their intentions are predictably destructive. It would be wise to bring them to battle before they reach full strength and start attacking the Glades.	false
incidents_localised_description_wh2_dlc16_incident_wef_drycha_bizzare_creatures	The eyes and ears of the forest whisper rumours of looming shadows lumbering through the woodland depths. The creatures that cast them are unseen as if invisible, but the evidence of their passage is clear for all to see with pathways of downtrodden trees and flattened undergrowth mysteriously appearing without explanation. It appears that whatever the creatures are, they never stop in one place for too long. We must be wary…	false
incidents_localised_description_wh2_dlc16_incident_wef_drycha_coeddils_wisdom	Driven by all the vengeful rage of the forest, the soldiers of the wargrove march forth as the woodlands’ fiercest sentinels. Your mission is unending, for there will always be those whose folly causes harm to the wilderness, whether inadvertently or otherwise. At times, the struggle can be all-consuming, and even one with your depthless thirst for retribution can suffer from weariness and fatigue. It is in those times, however, that Coeddil projects his consciousness to commune with you, his conviction spurring you forth to continue your ceaseless task.	false
incidents_localised_description_wh2_dlc16_incident_wef_drycha_horrific_monstrosity	A strange, monstrous creature was encountered in the forest! The Dryads of the wargrove barely managed to defeat it, and those that managed to survive the encounter said it was definitely a minion of the Beastmen. Worse still, it bore the unmistakable taint of Cyanathair the Corruptor, also known as Morghur. Upon its death, the creature left behind a foul, black ichor that is corrupting the ground upon which it fell. This creature could not be Morghur himself, for the Dryads are familiar with his appearance, but the taint left behind indicates it was likely one of his offspring.	false
incidents_localised_description_wh2_dlc16_incident_wef_drycha_intro_invasion	Your eyes and ears at the edge of the forest have alerted you to the presence of militiamen who are mustering in a nearby camp. You have dealt with the men of the Old World before; given your previous blood-soaked forays into their lands, they are right to fear your kind. It would be wise to attack first before they reach full strength – show them once again that the spirits of the forest are not to be trifled with!	false
incidents_localised_description_wh2_dlc16_incident_wef_drycha_potion_sacre	From the cracked font of Parravon's cathedral, a great prize trickles – water blessed by the so-called Lady of the Lake. Drycha, whose memory extends to a time long before Bretonnians walked these lands, knows of the Lady's power and her connection to Athel Loren – with these waters, she can imbue her creaking, hateful host with such puissant magical protection that even the ancient wards of the Wildwood will be unable to hold them back.	false
incidents_localised_description_wh2_dlc16_incident_wef_drycha_strange_humans	We have encountered a group of men of the cold north. Though we would usually be hostile to these lesser beings, we observed them exhibiting virtues that are to be respected. They have an unusual relationship with certain creatures of the wild, riding into war upon great bears that we would usually expect to see tearing them to pieces rather than behaving as their allies. There is certainly more to these men than meets the eye…	false
incidents_localised_description_wh2_dlc16_incident_wef_drycha_undead_trees	The wretched Vampires of the Old World perpetually corrupt the lands and soil around their settlements with their Undead taint. You would usually care little for such things, yet their Necromantic magic sucks the very life out of the trees themselves while barely keeping them alive. Such a torturous existence at the hands of these vampiric parasites is no existence at all for the trees. We must counter this defilement with the magic of the forest.	false
incidents_localised_description_wh2_dlc16_incident_wef_drycha_vengeance_rains_from_above	As you journey across the deep forest you happen across an ancient grove of rare ash trees. Woeful whispers fill the air between the canopies, whispers of past atrocities committed against the grove throughout its unimaginably long existence. The magic is strong here, too. This is most fortuitous – the ash trees’ enchanted wood can be used to produce magically lethal arrows, sturdy and superbly weighted to travel great distances and pierce the hearts of your foes!	false
incidents_localised_description_wh2_dlc16_incident_wef_dwarfs_threaten_waterfall_palace	A Dwarf throng has been spotted at the edge of the forest seemingly readying themselves for battle. It appears their age-old grudges against the fey shall never be abated, as they are likely seeking revenge for some ancient grievance you’ve long forgotten, such is the folly of the lesser races. Even now, more battalions march to join them – it would be prudent to confront these Dwarfs before they reach full strength and threaten the Glades.	false

incidents_localised_description_wh2_main_dilemma_treasure_hunt_hidden_tunnel_4_a	Nothing good can come from exploring these tunnels, except maybe a slow, painful death as the lunch of something deeply unpleasant. You collapse the tunnel entrance and walk away.	false
incidents_localised_description_wh2_main_dilemma_treasure_hunt_hidden_tunnel_4_b	Your retainers are a tad overzealous collapsing the tunnel, and some of your supplies are caught in the blast. Angered, you leave the idiots to their fate and leave the building.	false

incidents_localised_description_wh2_main_dilemma_treasure_hunt_rebel_army_4_b	Entering the barn, you challenge the survivors and a stand-off ensues. Enraged by your arrogance, they refuse to surrender. Rallying together, they defame you as a tyrant.	false
incidents_localised_description_wh2_main_dilemma_treasure_hunt_scavengers_1_a	The other party are not known to you, and they are carrying a variety of very sharp-looking weapons with them. Plunder is never worth losing your life over; you leave empty handed.	false

Our agents may have been responsible, but placing a few corpses belonging to {{CcoCampaignEventIncident:SecondTargetName}} of {{CcoCampaignEventIncident:SecondTargetFactionName}} should switch the blame to them.	false
incidents_localised_description_wh2_main_incident_intrigue_any_negative_2b	A generous gift has been received by {{CcoCampaignEventIncident:FirstTargetName}} of {{CcoCampaignEventIncident:FirstTargetFactionName}} from {{CcoCampaignEventIncident:SecondTargetName}} of {{CcoCampaignEventIncident:SecondTargetFactionName}}. Unbeknownst to both, the shipment was intercepted en route, the gifts replaced by inferior copies in much lower quantities than promised.	false
incidents_localised_description_wh2_main_incident_intrigue_any_negative_3a	{{CcoCampaignEventIncident:FirstTargetName}} of {{CcoCampaignEventIncident:FirstTargetFactionName}} has been specifically forbidden to act this way due to a pact signed by {{CcoCampaignEventIncident:SecondTargetName}} of {{CcoCampaignEventIncident:SecondTargetFactionName}}. They have done no such thing of course, but our agents will tell the signee otherwise.	false
incidents_localised_description_wh2_main_incident_intrigue_any_negative_3b	We offer our services as a neutral party to negotiate a trade agreement between {{CcoCampaignEventIncident:FirstTargetName}} of {{CcoCampaignEventIncident:FirstTargetFactionName}} and {{CcoCampaignEventIncident:SecondTargetName}} of {{CcoCampaignEventIncident:SecondTargetFactionName}}. While our factors smile and encourage, they will be briefing against the interests of both.	false
incidents_localised_description_wh2_main_incident_intrigue_any_positive_1a	A wagon full of high-quality blades and armour has been delivered to {{CcoCampaignEventIncident:FirstTargetName}} of {{CcoCampaignEventIncident:FirstTargetFactionName}}. It is mere child’s play to insinuate that this gift is from {{CcoCampaignEventIncident:SecondTargetName}} of {{CcoCampaignEventIncident:SecondTargetFactionName}} – they will be too stupid and flattered to deny it!	false
incidents_localised_description_wh2_main_incident_intrigue_any_positive_1b	There’s nothing clever or subtle here, simply our agent disguising themselves though mundane and arcane means into a factor of {{CcoCampaignEventIncident:FirstTargetName}} of {{CcoCampaignEventIncident:FirstTargetFactionName}} and giving a large gift of precious things to {{CcoCampaignEventIncident:SecondTargetName}} of {{CcoCampaignEventIncident:SecondTargetFactionName}}.	false
incidents_localised_description_wh2_main_incident_intrigue_any_positive_1c	Let the races believe the notion that we dwindle but that our reach is still vast, our power to adjudicate and even dictate trade relations remains unchallenged. Granting {{CcoCampaignEventIncident:FirstTargetName}} of {{CcoCampaignEventIncident:FirstTargetFactionName}} and {{CcoCampaignEventIncident:SecondTargetName}} of {{CcoCampaignEventIncident:SecondTargetFactionName}} favourable trade relations will strengthen relations between them, for our gain.	false
incidents_localised_description_wh2_main_incident_intrigue_any_positive_1d	While the younger races frolic and fight we take advantage for our gains. Let us advise {{CcoCampaignEventIncident:FirstTargetName}} of {{CcoCampaignEventIncident:FirstTargetFactionName}} to make overtures to {{CcoCampaignEventIncident:SecondTargetName}} of {{CcoCampaignEventIncident:SecondTargetFactionName}}. If they think it is their own idea, then more’s the better!	false
incidents_localised_description_wh2_main_incident_intrigue_any_positive_2a	Nothing fosters relations than the death of a common foe. So, sending hated corpses to both {{CcoCampaignEventIncident:FirstTargetName}} of {{CcoCampaignEventIncident:FirstTargetFactionName}}, and {{CcoCampaignEventIncident:SecondTargetName}} of {{CcoCampaignEventIncident:SecondTargetFactionName}}, each with missives attached to the bodies claiming credit, should fool these two factions into strengthening their bonds.	false
incidents_localised_description_wh2_main_incident_intrigue_any_positive_2b	Our embassies are often thought of as neutral ground to even the most hated of foes. Nothing could be further from the truth, obviously, but we control the environment and manipulate everything from ambience to the subject of conversation, ensuring that {{CcoCampaignEventIncident:FirstTargetName}} of {{CcoCampaignEventIncident:FirstTargetFactionName}} and {{CcoCampaignEventIncident:SecondTargetName}} of {{CcoCampaignEventIncident:SecondTargetFactionName}} are more predisposed to each other.	false
incidents_localised_description_wh2_main_incident_intrigue_any_positive_3a	Diverting an enemy into the ambush range of {{CcoCampaignEventIncident:FirstTargetName}} of {{CcoCampaignEventIncident:FirstTargetFactionName}} is the first part of the ploy; letting them keep the gold we planted on the convoy will lead them to a more favourable relationship with {{CcoCampaignEventIncident:SecondTargetName}} of {{CcoCampaignEventIncident:SecondTargetFactionName}}, whose sigil is stamped into the hoard.	false
incidents_localised_description_wh2_main_incident_intrigue_any_positive_3b	We have many relics in our archives, trinkets to us but sacred for others. A gift given to {{CcoCampaignEventIncident:FirstTargetName}} of {{CcoCampaignEventIncident:FirstTargetFactionName}}, will make them more receptive to our scheme of including {{CcoCampaignEventIncident:SecondTargetName}} of {{CcoCampaignEventIncident:SecondTargetFactionName}} in the next phase.	false
incidents_localised_description_wh2_main_incident_intrigue_def_negative_1a	One of your agents, posing as a Druchii, stirs the cauldron of hate.

incidents_localised_description_wh2_main_incident_intrigue_def_negative_1b	While frowned upon in Ulthuan, hiring a Khainite Assassin is common practice in Naggaroth, so let us put a contract on {{CcoCampaignEventIncident:FirstTargetFactionName}}; failure is irrelevant as long as {{CcoCampaignEventIncident:SecondTargetFactionName}} is implicated.	false
incidents_localised_description_wh2_main_incident_intrigue_def_negative_1c	Not all brave Asur are on the battlefields, some commit to a covert life hidden in Druchii society for the good of Ulthuan. This one has taken the role of paramour and can influence through bed sport, suggesting to {{CcoCampaignEventIncident:FirstTargetFactionName}} that {{CcoCampaignEventIncident:SecondTargetFactionName}} is not an ally but a foe.	false
incidents_localised_description_wh2_main_incident_intrigue_def_negative_2a	Manipulate a Dreadlord to believe that {{CcoCampaignEventIncident:SecondTargetFactionName}} is working hand-in-gauntlet with {{CcoCampaignEventIncident:FirstTargetFactionName}} at court, thus forcing them apart.	false
incidents_localised_description_wh2_main_incident_intrigue_def_negative_3a	The Druchii are keen users of poison, so we shall spike the food of {{CcoCampaignEventIncident:FirstTargetName}} of {{CcoCampaignEventIncident:FirstTargetFactionName}}. Not to kill, but to give a nasty ache. When suspicion falls upon the cook, let us ensure they are in {{CcoCampaignEventIncident:SecondTargetFactionName}}’s thrall.	false
incidents_localised_description_wh2_main_incident_intrigue_def_positive_1a	To flatter and bribe is to ensure favour… delivering a gift of slaves to {{CcoCampaignEventIncident:FirstTargetFactionName}} is regrettable for the captives, but if we frame this as {{CcoCampaignEventIncident:SecondTargetFactionName}}’s generosity it will strengthen the bond between these two factions, and be advantageous for us.	false
incidents_localised_description_wh2_main_incident_intrigue_def_positive_1b	Send {{CcoCampaignEventIncident:FirstTargetFactionName}} a corpse - but not one of our own. We shall send them back one of their own sleeper agents - not that they will know why they were killed. And on this corpse a message stressing the {{CcoCampaignEventIncident:SecondTargetFactionName}}’s predisposition to the Druchii.	false
incidents_localised_description_wh2_main_incident_intrigue_def_positive_1c	There are always enemies and annoyances for kings, queens and Dreadlords to overcome. Paying a contract to rid them of such a foe will leave {{CcoCampaignEventIncident:FirstTargetFactionName}} predisposed to {{CcoCampaignEventIncident:SecondTargetFactionName}}, especially if we let it be known they hired the assassin.	false
incidents_localised_description_wh2_main_incident_intrigue_def_positive_2a	Who knows more about the intrigues and secrets within the dread citadels? The advisors? The paramours? It is the torturers, of course, for they get the unvarnished truth. And if a certain torturer is in our employ they can report to {{CcoCampaignEventIncident:FirstTargetFactionName}} and encourage stronger ties with {{CcoCampaignEventIncident:SecondTargetFactionName}} using what they learnt during recent ‘extractions’.	false
incidents_localised_description_wh2_main_incident_intrigue_def_positive_3a	Sending {{CcoCampaignEventIncident:SecondTargetFactionName}} a list of their enemies and allies might be viewed with a certain suspicion, but if we make sure that {{CcoCampaignEventIncident:FirstTargetFactionName}} is in the allies’ column and add an enemy’s finger for verisimilitude, it might be believed.	false
incidents_localised_description_wh2_main_incident_intrigue_emp_negative_1	Wagons full of imperial goods frequently depart to foreign lands. A particularly large convoy disappeared, however. An investigation found the merchants and guards tied to trees and all the wagons plundered. The foreign lord denies any responsibility, but even a child knows that he is to blame for not keeping the roads clear.	false
incidents_localised_description_wh2_main_incident_intrigue_emp_negative_2	A noble has managed to get himself in an embarrassing position. While a foreign dignitary was visiting, rumours started circulating that the noble was ridiculing the foreign delegation behind their backs and even hired a few jesters to give a private performance to mock them. Of course the noble denied it, but a few days later, a letter addressed to his wife surfaced, in which he expressed his disdain for the foreign dignitary. The delegation departed at once and spread the stories of their mistreatment back home.	false
incidents_localised_description_wh2_main_incident_intrigue_emp_negative_3	The wife of a local baron went missing without a trace. Weeks pass and searches return nothing. At the next full moon however, she is found dead and mutilated, hanging above the city gate. A letter was stuffed into her throat, with another faction expressing their hatred for the baron and claiming responsibility.	false

incidents_localised_description_wh2_main_incident_intrigue_emp_positive_2	An exotic Caravan appears in mankind's realm, claiming to be from a foreign kingdom. Their goods are of high quality and their prices low. Intrigued by the opportunities of trade, merchants soon flock to the foreign territory in the hopes of securing a good deal.	false
incidents_localised_description_wh2_main_incident_intrigue_emp_positive_3	Seemingly random lords received an invitation of a tournament hosted near Nuln. Upon arrival, they discovered that the tournament grounds have been set up and a foreign delegation was already present. But the foreigners claim they received a similar invitation, and no-one knows who is the host, nor how the tournament grounds were erected. A crate with a massive golden trophy is soon discovered. Both sides agree to compete honourably, with the winning faction receiving the trophy. After the festivities end, both sides agree they had a great time together and the tournament should become an annual event.	false
incidents_localised_description_wh2_main_incident_intrigue_hef_negative_1a	While they can be blunt, the Asur tend to veil insults through the arts. In the name of {{CcoCampaignEventIncident:SecondTargetFactionName}}, commission a particularly stinging song about {{CcoCampaignEventIncident:FirstTargetFactionName}}. Don’t forget a catchy chorus to ensure it travels beyond court.	false
incidents_localised_description_wh2_main_incident_intrigue_hef_negative_1b	Have our servants talk to the serfs of {{CcoCampaignEventIncident:FirstTargetFactionName}}, let them spread vicious gossip about the plans of {{CcoCampaignEventIncident:SecondTargetFactionName}}.

incidents_localised_description_wh2_main_incident_intrigue_hef_negative_1c	{{CcoCampaignEventIncident:SecondTargetName}} of {{CcoCampaignEventIncident:SecondTargetFactionName}} has the manners of a drunk Dwarf!

Nevertheless, it reflects badly on the host, {{CcoCampaignEventIncident:FirstTargetFactionName}}.	false
incidents_localised_description_wh2_main_incident_intrigue_hef_negative_1d	The simplest ploys are often the most effective. Through the chatter of court, let it be known that {{CcoCampaignEventIncident:FirstTargetFactionName}} and {{CcoCampaignEventIncident:SecondTargetFactionName}} have been overheard defaming Finubar, wondering if he is up to the duties that come with the crown.	false
incidents_localised_description_wh2_main_incident_intrigue_hef_negative_2a	There is a constant fear that anyone in Ulthuan could be one of the Witch King’s agents in deep cover. It is almost too easy to lay a whispered suggestion that the life partner of {{CcoCampaignEventIncident:SecondTargetName}} of {{CcoCampaignEventIncident:SecondTargetFactionName}} takes orders from Naggarond. Just ensure they know the rumour came from {{CcoCampaignEventIncident:FirstTargetFactionName}}.	false
incidents_localised_description_wh2_main_incident_intrigue_hef_negative_2b	To accuse {{CcoCampaignEventIncident:FirstTargetFactionName}} of worshipping the gods of the underworld is a serious charge. Although not technically illegal, it is frowned upon, and the loss of standing in the Phoenix Court will be quick. So, proof is needed, which is why you have installed a statue of Atharti at the accused estate, with a note of appreciation from {{CcoCampaignEventIncident:SecondTargetFactionName}}.	false
incidents_localised_description_wh2_main_incident_intrigue_hef_negative_3a	The Cults of Pleasure are insidious. The gossip at court is that {{CcoCampaignEventIncident:FirstTargetName}} of {{CcoCampaignEventIncident:FirstTargetFactionName}} attended a party hosted by {{CcoCampaignEventIncident:SecondTargetFactionName}} and the excesses witnessed were scandalous. The talk is untrue, of course, but the more they deny, the faster the rumour spreads.	false
incidents_localised_description_wh2_main_incident_intrigue_hef_negative_3b	The most effective way to damage relationships is to insinuate rather than use a Dawi’s bluntness. A half-jape to a prince here, a missive sent to an outer kingdom that doesn’t give the full story there… soon there is suspicion between {{CcoCampaignEventIncident:FirstTargetFactionName}} and {{CcoCampaignEventIncident:SecondTargetFactionName}}. As we intended.	false
incidents_localised_description_wh2_main_incident_intrigue_hef_positive_1a	A careful discussion here, a subtle word over wine there, a smile that lingers, an eyebrow raised over a jest - all things men and Dwarfs would never pick up on.

incidents_localised_description_wh2_main_incident_intrigue_hef_positive_1b	Our kin take great store in words and verse.

incidents_localised_description_wh2_main_incident_intrigue_hef_positive_1c	The game of court has winners and losers; the fate of houses can be lost not just by invasion but by their Prince’s performance at court.

incidents_localised_description_wh2_main_incident_intrigue_hef_positive_1d	Business at the Phoenix Court rarely happens while the king attends and deals with matters of state. It is when the Princes and Nobles splinter off to the alcoves and form informal sub-committees that things get done and so, over a few cups of wine, the binding of {{CcoCampaignEventIncident:FirstTargetFactionName}} and {{CcoCampaignEventIncident:SecondTargetFactionName}} can begin.	false
incidents_localised_description_wh2_main_incident_intrigue_hef_positive_2a	Finubar’s war council is not an official organisation, more the Phoenix King’s close associates that guide and advise on matters of war. To be invited into the council is a great honour, so engineer {{CcoCampaignEventIncident:SecondTargetFactionName}}’s participation with {{CcoCampaignEventIncident:FirstTargetFactionName}} to improve their relations.	false
incidents_localised_description_wh2_main_incident_intrigue_hef_positive_2b	Taking on a ward or squire from another house is a good way of exerting soft power and strengthening lasting bonds between two houses or kingdoms.

incidents_localised_description_wh2_main_incident_intrigue_hef_positive_3a	The favour of Finubar will do wonders for any great Elven house.

incidents_localised_description_wh2_main_incident_intrigue_lzd_negative_1a	The lizard’s inability to tell apart some races - especially the Druchii and Asur - give us an advantage to sour relations. An ambush by our hand on {{CcoCampaignEventIncident:FirstTargetFactionName}} can be easily framed to make {{CcoCampaignEventIncident:SecondTargetFactionName}} look responsible.	false
incidents_localised_description_wh2_main_incident_intrigue_lzd_negative_1b	Some say it is impossible to deceive the Slann, that the great toads perceive all and the reason they do not stop our plots and mummery is that they believe it is all part of their Great Plan – let us test this notion and set {{CcoCampaignEventIncident:FirstTargetFactionName}} and {{CcoCampaignEventIncident:SecondTargetFactionName}} against each other.	false
incidents_localised_description_wh2_main_incident_intrigue_lzd_negative_2a	A rather brutish technique is to smash some plaques that the Lizardmen hold in high regard. The subtlety comes in selecting which of the reptiles’ sacred plaques to destroy, in turn leading them to conclude that relations between {{CcoCampaignEventIncident:FirstTargetFactionName}} and {{CcoCampaignEventIncident:SecondTargetFactionName}} should sour.	false
incidents_localised_description_wh2_main_incident_intrigue_lzd_negative_3a	A dark deed, one which Isha would not approve even if Ereth Khial does. A potion delivered into a spawning pool will sour the water and stunt Lizardmen growth. This will anger {{CcoCampaignEventIncident:FirstTargetFactionName}}; leave the phial close by, with the imprint of {{CcoCampaignEventIncident:SecondTargetFactionName}}.	false
incidents_localised_description_wh2_main_incident_intrigue_lzd_positive_1a	If we tell the gullible reptiles that an alliance between {{CcoCampaignEventIncident:FirstTargetFactionName}} and {{CcoCampaignEventIncident:SecondTargetFactionName}} is part of their Great Plan then they will action it. If they question the provenance of such a claim, then say it was on some ancient scroll or other.	false
incidents_localised_description_wh2_main_incident_intrigue_lzd_positive_1b	We need a more stable relationship between {{CcoCampaignEventIncident:FirstTargetFactionName}} and {{CcoCampaignEventIncident:SecondTargetFactionName}}. A few new hieroglyphs in these ‘ancient’ plaques should be enough of a catalyst.	false
incidents_localised_description_wh2_main_incident_intrigue_lzd_positive_1c	Send captured Skaven to the Slann as a sacrificial gift to the Old Ones, and their snake god in particular. This should please {{CcoCampaignEventIncident:SecondTargetFactionName}}; imply the sacrifices came from {{CcoCampaignEventIncident:FirstTargetFactionName}} to bolster their relations.	false
incidents_localised_description_wh2_main_incident_intrigue_lzd_positive_2a	Stolen from the Dark Elves, ancient Cold One eggs can be given to {{CcoCampaignEventIncident:FirstTargetFactionName}} as a gift from {{CcoCampaignEventIncident:SecondTargetFactionName}}. They are unlikely to dissuade the notion it was not due to their generosity.	false
incidents_localised_description_wh2_main_incident_intrigue_lzd_positive_3a	The reptiles’ reliance on prophecy and stellar arrangements make then susceptible for subtle manipulations. Using the Wind of Azyr we can slightly alter the skies and bring the Lizardmen to the conclusion that relations between {{CcoCampaignEventIncident:FirstTargetFactionName}} and {{CcoCampaignEventIncident:SecondTargetFactionName}} should be improved.	false
incidents_localised_description_wh2_main_incident_intrigue_skv_negative_1a	The easiest way to manipulate the Skaven is to kill an ally or vassal of {{CcoCampaignEventIncident:FirstTargetFactionName}} and then leave the blade in its back, ensuring the traitorous dagger is etched with the sigil of {{CcoCampaignEventIncident:SecondTargetFactionName}}.	false
incidents_localised_description_wh2_main_incident_intrigue_skv_negative_1b	Like igniting damp wood, spreading whispers of treachery throughout the Skaven clans is hard at first, especially for an Elf…but once the notion takes hold, once the wood begins to burn, it will spread like wildfire. Hence the rumours that {{CcoCampaignEventIncident:SecondTargetFactionName}} plans to betray {{CcoCampaignEventIncident:FirstTargetFactionName}} will quickly take hold.	false
incidents_localised_description_wh2_main_incident_intrigue_skv_negative_1c	The favour – or lack thereof – of the Lords of Decay can easily shatter alliances.

incidents_localised_description_wh2_main_incident_intrigue_skv_negative_2a	A more overt attack: strike with Shadow Warriors, kill the allies of {{CcoCampaignEventIncident:FirstTargetFactionName}} as they watch and then give {{CcoCampaignEventIncident:SecondTargetFactionName}} a friendly wave before disappearing back into the night. It will not be the dead that they focus on but the wave, which will bring down a cloud of suspicion and paranoia.	false
incidents_localised_description_wh2_main_incident_intrigue_skv_negative_3a	What do we have before us but a lump of purest green? Taking Warpstone from Skaven is one of the greatest crimes - killing their kin or allies is a minor annoyance but stealing their Warpstone will get a furious response. And so we shall purloin the green of {{CcoCampaignEventIncident:FirstTargetFactionName}}, leaving ‘evidence’ that {{CcoCampaignEventIncident:SecondTargetFactionName}} are the thieves.	false
incidents_localised_description_wh2_main_incident_intrigue_skv_positive_1a	The Skaven deal in fell Chaos rock, its presence fortunately extremely rare on Ulthuan.

incidents_localised_description_wh2_main_incident_intrigue_skv_positive_1b	Send a message of greeting and friendship… and a Warptoken bribe to {{CcoCampaignEventIncident:FirstTargetFactionName}}.

incidents_localised_description_wh2_main_incident_intrigue_skv_positive_2a	The Skaven hate us as much as we do them, so let us use this to our advantage.

incidents_localised_description_wh2_main_incident_intrigue_skv_positive_3a	Manipulating a minor ratmen clan is not hard; through various factors, often in disguise as Druchii, we can have the Skaven as our puppets, sending them as neutral ambassadors: first to {{CcoCampaignEventIncident:FirstTargetFactionName}} then to {{CcoCampaignEventIncident:SecondTargetFactionName}}. Once in our targets’ presence they will squeak and lavish many platitudes to appease their frail egos.	false

incidents_localised_description_wh2_main_incident_lzd_cold_one_recruitment_cost_down_campaign_movement_range_up	The last Cold One spawning yielded a rare strain, gifted with some notion of your venerable race's plight in their tiny brains. These beasts are so eager to fight for you that they barely need taming, and their urgency means that friendly infantry must trot to keep up. As a result, recruitment costs for Cold One cavalry units have fallen and army movement range has increased factionwide.  	false

incidents_localised_description_wh2_main_incident_lzd_growth_down	Fathoming the Great Plan is not the exact science it once was. In the misguided belief that their talents may be lent to astromancy, the Mage-Priests have been committing fewer Kroxigors to heavy construction duties, effectively slowing the rate of local growth.	false
incidents_localised_description_wh2_main_incident_lzd_melee_infantry_melee_defense_up	A rich vein of uncommonly dense obsinite has been unearthed at the edges of the Copper Desert. Properly worked, it produces a razor-sharp blade with incredible handling that can turn aside lesser weapons with ease. The Skink artisans have set to work forging it into new weapons for distribution among the armed forces. As a result, melee defence capabilities have risen factionwide.	false
incidents_localised_description_wh2_main_incident_lzd_monster_recruitment_cost_down	A battle-scarred Saurus Oldblood has come to your attention at the urging of the Mage-Priests. More feral than his brethren, he has a natural empathy with the great beasts of Lustria, who rally to him as one of their own. With much fasting and meditation, others are learning to commune in this fashion. As a result, recruitment costs for monstrous creatures have fallen factionwide.  	false
incidents_localised_description_wh2_main_incident_lzd_morale_down_recruitment_cost_up	It is whispered that elements of this army once visited Quetza, the defiled city, and were irrevocably changed by what they saw.

incidents_localised_description_wh2_main_incident_lzd_morale_up_public_order_up	Fragments of an ancient tablet have been unearthed, chronicling matters from the age of the Old Ones. This is a cause for great celebration – both leadership and control have risen here! 	false
incidents_localised_description_wh2_main_incident_lzd_public_order_down	While honing his channelling skills, a local Mage-Priest became distracted by some deep rumination. Instead of remotely unleashing a magic missile from the nearby Skink Priest, the Winds of Magic reached critical mass within it, causing the creature's skull to loudly – and very publicly – detonate. The local inhabitants have taken this as a dire omen, and control has fallen in this province as a result!	false
incidents_localised_description_wh2_main_incident_lzd_public_order_up_temple_guard_recruitment_cost_down	A new decree has been passed, venerating the ever-vigilant Temple Guard.

incidents_localised_description_wh2_main_incident_lzd_recruitment_cost_up_starting_exp_up	There are many veterans in your empire, employing the skills they learned through armed service in the civic sphere.

Recruitment costs and starting experience have both increased factionwide as a result. 	false
incidents_localised_description_wh2_main_incident_lzd_recruitment_morale_up_against_def_skv	One may fear the unknown, but as the true shape of a thing is ascertained - as its strengths and weaknesses are appraised - fear gives way to an understanding of its limitations. Through a recent educational program, your troops are coming to understand their enemies better and thus fear them less. As a result, leadership when fighting Skaven and Dark Elves has now increased factionwide.	false

The Clanrats appear more hench and jittery than usual; whiskers twitch to unfelt breezes, and ears tremble at the call of distant voices.

Unsurprisingly, your research rate has increased factionwide!	false

incidents_localised_description_wh2_twa03_incident_rakarth_battle_harpies	The stench of death pervades the air, rising from the bloody corpses littering the battlefield as far as the eye can see. It isn't long before the Harpies descend.

They will make for fine additions to your menagerie of monsters.	false

Lured to the surface by the clashing of battle and churning of the waves, a brutish Kharibdyss is now bound to your control.\\n\\nHow delicious the terror of your foes will be, as they flee from the writhing mass of tentacles that seek to crush their bones and deliver them whole into the creature's gaping maw.	false
incidents_localised_description_wh2_twa03_incident_rakarth_battle_spiders	A slew of bodies litter the Underway, strewn at odd angles amidst a sea of blood and viscera. Every corpse exudes the rank scent of death, drawing in the creatures that call these underground tunnels home.\\n\\nGiant Spiders soon skitter into view, ready to feast in the aftermath of battle. Breaking them shall prove a simple task. Once they succumb to your control, they will have more than enough corpses to sink their fangs into.	false
incidents_localised_description_wh2_twa03_incident_rakarth_battle_squigs	In the looming dark of the Underway, the Squigs make their home, hopping aimlessly from meal to meal. Such simple creatures are easily broken.\\n\\nDrawn in by the sounds of battle echoing through their caves, they now make their new home among your impressive array of broken creatures. Vicious and brimming with violent hunger, these cave-dwelling monstrosities are obedient to your every word, and feast on the flesh of your enemies.	false
incidents_localised_description_wh2_twa03_incident_rakarth_dilemma_beast_darklands_common	The long-absent Beastmasters stagger unannounced from your audience. Scratches and bite-marks beriddle them – a few, you're sure, are curiously absent.\\n\\nThey hail from the Mountains of Mourn, heartland of the Ogre Kingdoms.

incidents_localised_description_wh2_twa03_incident_rakarth_dilemma_beast_darklands_rare	Your surprise is visible when the novice Beastmasters you'd sent to the Darklands – second-class tamers whom, you were sure, could scarcely wrangle a Squig – arrive at your capital with a Wyvern in tow.\\n\\nWith little invitation, the Beastmasters recount their story. Stopping for supplies at Pigbarter, they'd encountered a Gnoblar caravan with the Wyvern for sale – an extortionate price, you're told. It was then that one of the more unskilled Beastmasters had the bright idea to simply slaughter the caravan and take the beast.\\n\\nHardly impressive Beastmastery, but a rare find nonetheless.	false
incidents_localised_description_wh2_twa03_incident_rakarth_dilemma_beast_market_common	Upon returning from the beast markets of Naggaroth, the Beastmaster aspirants revealed that they successfully haggled to obtain one Feral Manticore and two flocks of bloodthirsty Harpies for your Monster Pens.

incidents_localised_description_wh2_twa03_incident_rakarth_dilemma_beast_market_rare	The Beastmasters have returned from the beast markets of Naggaroth, half in number but with an extremely impressive haul – a titanic War Hydra that had devoured an unfortunate portion of the novices en route, but is now amongst the most potent weapons in your Monster Pens.\\n\\nYour Beastmasters’ heavy-handed approach with the merchants and the mention of the Beastlord’s name have also spread fear throughout the marketplaces in the Land of Chill, temporarily driving down prices – but only for you, of course.	false
incidents_localised_description_wh2_twa03_incident_rakarth_dilemma_lustria_common	The Beastmasters have returned from their Lustrian expedition alive with a very decent catch of Feral Cold Ones and a Feral Stegadon for the Monster Pens.\\n\\nThe aspirants have more than proven their considerable wrangling skills, for Lustrian game is notoriously hard to tame.

incidents_localised_description_wh2_twa03_incident_rakarth_dilemma_old_world_common	The Beastmasters returned from the Old World with a haul of Exploding Squigs and Giant Spiders for the Monster Pens – a decent return, but no more than what you expected from the home of the world’s more tameable beasts.\\n\\nBy not returning empty-handed, the aspirants have at least shown basic aptitude in beast control, sparing them the disgrace of being exiled from your retinue.	false

They shall make fine slaves indeed!	false

incidents_localised_description_wh2_twa03_incident_rakarth_raid_bears	A great trail of bloody hoofprints winds through the woods. You stalk it for days to secure the kill, only to find the cloven creature’s corpse already set upon by a sleuth of Bears. These hulking hunters must have brought down the colossus by themselves, through sheer might – impressive, you must admit.\\n\\nNo matter. The bears cease their gorging at the crack of your lash – they’ll soon have plenty more to eat.	false
incidents_localised_description_wh2_twa03_incident_rakarth_raid_cold_ones	Through ruthless leadership and unparalleled skill, your raid has borne the most precious fruit. A number of violent and savage Cold Ones have been captured prowling the region, ripe for the breaking. Soon they will be bent to your every whim.\\n\\nHunting in packs, these feral, reptilian predators will track down your prey, tearing them limb from bloody limb. These cold-blooded hunters make for a worthy addition to your beastly collection.	false
incidents_localised_description_wh2_twa03_incident_rakarth_raid_harpies	Nestled amidst treacherous mountain peaks lie the salt-stained caves of the Harpies, where an entire flock of the winged beasts have been caught and chained by your raiding party.\\n\\nTheir will is no match for that of such an illustrious Beastmaster. Under your sway, they will attack and harass your enemies, descending on them with ravenous fury. Soaring high above the battlefield, they will heed your call, and devour the enemy in a swarm of sharp teeth and vicious claws.	false
incidents_localised_description_wh2_twa03_incident_rakarth_raid_hydra	Your raid has uncovered a most rare and coveted prize. Lured from its bone-strewn mountain lair, a tamed Hydra makes for an awe-striking trophy of your mastery and skill.\\n\\nA gargantuan, many-headed monster, the Hydra is capable of decimating scores of enemies, its voracious appetite never sated. All will look on you with fear and reverence, for the binding of such a magnificent creature is a feat to be envied by all.	false
incidents_localised_description_wh2_twa03_incident_rakarth_raid_ice_bears	A blizzard envelops the icy wastes, putting a stop to your scavenging and forcing you to take shelter in a frozen cave. You strike a torch, only to find yourself encircled by a dozen hungry Ice Bears – their lumbering frames quickly staggering between you and the exit.\\n\\nThough the Bears emanate a chilling ferocity, you need only best the largest to earn their fear. When the winds subside, these beasts will serve you in battle.	false
incidents_localised_description_wh2_twa03_incident_rakarth_raid_manticore	To witness the power and ferocity of the Manticore is to witness an incarnation of Khaine himself. An instrument of carnage and murder, the Manticore your raiders have captured is a creature of Chaos and corruption, mutated into a horrifying form.\\n\\nThe hulking, leonine beast soars into battle on dark, leathery wings. A boon for any Beastmaster to have tamed, for few who come face to face with these feral creatures live to tell the tale.	false
incidents_localised_description_wh2_twa03_incident_rakarth_raid_sabretusks	Foraging for firewood among the endless crags, your forces are ambushed by Sabretusks. These vicious, feline creatures – perhaps escapees of a nearby Ogre tribe – must have stalked you for some time, given their evident voracity.\\n\\nBut the element of surprise is no match for a Beastmaster of Karond Kar. Freshly captured, this pack will serve your conquests in short order.	false
incidents_localised_description_wh2_twa03_incident_rakarth_raid_spiders	Far from the forest trail, you weave between towering trees, and a maze of silken strands holding the bones of those who walked this path before you. Large, black shadows creep along the edge of your vision, drawing you ever deeper into their web.\\n\\nYou soon find yourself in a Giant Spiders' lair, where countless eyes stare back at you from the darkness. They don't attack. Instead, they wait, ready to obey your first command.	false
incidents_localised_description_wh2_twa03_incident_rakarth_raid_squigs	Your venture through the perilous Wasteland has proven profitable indeed. Not long into your journey, your raiding party comes across a ravenous band of Exploding Squigs, as volatile as they are unintelligent.\\n\\nBinding them to your will proves no real challenge, yet their pointed teeth and gaping maws will surely be a boon in battle. With a single command, they will descend on your enemies, attacking with explosive intent.	false
incidents_localised_description_wh2_twa03_incident_rakarth_raid_stegadon	Raiding the vast, dense jungles of Lustria proves prosperous indeed with the capture of a mighty Stegadon. Shielded by scales and spikes of bone, the great, horned beast is a nigh-on unstoppable force when charging, striking fear into the hearts of even the hardiest warrior.\\n\\nBroken and tamed, it will defend your territories aggressively, and give any attacker sufficient cause for fleeing. When called upon, the bulky frame of the Stegadon will brush aside anything in your way.	false
incidents_localised_description_wh2_twa03_incident_rakarth_raid_wolves	Prowling the wild forests of this region, wolf packs descend upon the unwary in search of their next meal. Thus, it was but a matter of time before your raids into their territory resulted in a confrontation. Though wild, vicious and resourceful, the whole pack is soon cornered and ensnared by your men.\\n\\nBrought before you, it seems they recognise the ice in your veins, and the cruelty of your gaze. It would seem that this pack has found a new leader.	false
incidents_localised_description_wh2_twa03_incident_rakarth_raid_wyvern	Charred bones and scorched earth mark a trail across the desert, leading you on a hunt of the greatest peril. A Wyvern awaits you in its lair, monstrous in size, and as savage as the landscape it calls home.\\n\\nWhen the beast bears its teeth, you crack your whip in response. The battle of wills that commences feels like it lasts an age, until finally the dust settles, and the Wyvern bows its mighty head.	false
incidents_localised_description_wh2_twa03_incident_rakarth_settlement_chaos_manticore	On leathery wings and powerful leonine legs, the Manticore prowls amidst the ruined camp. How kind of the Northmen to leave such a prize behind!\\n\\nThe creature roars with an unabated, primal fury, yet something shifts once its menacing gaze meets your own.

incidents_localised_description_wh2_twa03_incident_rakarth_settlement_dark_elf_medusae	Your conquest has uncovered a most promising find – a Medusae, hideous and vengeful, writhes against the chafing grip of her chains. Her face is masked, to hide her deadly gaze, for one look into her haunted eyes would send the blood spilling from your every pore.\\n\\nThese tortured creatures are no match for the Beastlord of Karond Kar, however. They will make for a fine addition to your menagerie of monsters; you need only take hold of their chains.	false
incidents_localised_description_wh2_twa03_incident_rakarth_settlement_greenskins_squigs	The battle is done, and territory is not all you claim in your victory. The ravenous Squigs that once roamed aimlessly among these filth-ridden, Greenskin hovels have been rounded up and brought before you. A fine gift!\\n\\nThough pitifully simple and unintelligent as they are, their razor-sharp teeth and ravenous hunger will make them a worthwhile addition to your monstrous collection, once broken. And breaking them will prove enjoyable indeed.	false
incidents_localised_description_wh2_twa03_incident_rakarth_settlement_greenskins_wyvern	Though they were no match for your might, these pitiful Greenskin louts did at least one thing right. A majestic Wyvern roars in its pen, no doubt hatched and raised by the same unfortunate fools that lie dead at its feet.\\n\\nAs wild as the creature appears, it soon bends to your will. Such a menacing beast will serve you well, for the shadow it casts on your enemies will be terrifying indeed.	false
incidents_localised_description_wh2_twa03_incident_rakarth_settlement_high_elf_dragon	The haughty looks and condescension of the your Elf cousins count for nothing in the face of your might, and in their defeat you gain the most precious of prizes. To think, the glorious strength and power of a Dragon lies in such a comparatively small egg!\\n\\nYour men whet their lips with ambition; to consume the egg is to consume the Dragon's power. Yet your ambitions are altogether more practical. A Dragon hatchling is no small boon for a Beastmaster, after all.	false

How could you resist but to steal some for your monstrous collection? Such powerful beasts belong amidst the throngs of fearsome creatures under your thrall.\\n\\nTheir roar is truly deafening, yet they submit to the crack of your whip like any other.

incidents_localised_description_wh2_twa03_incident_rakarth_settlement_kislev_ice_bears	A pack of ferocious Ice Bears are the spoils of your latest conquest, once owned by the human kingdom of ice and snow. To break the will of such a beast is a feat of legend among the Kislevites, but surely a small task for a Beastmaster such as yourself.\\n\\nWith gnashing teeth, the bravest of them powers towards you, before the crack of your whip sends it stumbling to a stop. Soon, each bear buckles under the weight of your compulsion; a legendary feat indeed. 	false
incidents_localised_description_wh2_twa03_incident_rakarth_settlement_lizardmen_carnosaur	The spoils of victory often come in all manner of shapes and sizes. On this day, your reward is in the capture of the titanic, bestial mount of the Lizardmen — the apex predator among the jungles of Lustria.\\n\\nThe Carnosaur fears nothing and no-one, yet even as terrifying a creature as this can be broken. With the right pressure and pain, this ferocious hunter is little more than another valuable tool in your impressive menagerie of beasts. 	false
incidents_localised_description_wh2_twa03_incident_rakarth_settlement_lizardmen_stegadon	As the pitiful Lizardmen settlement falls under your control, so too does their prized possession.

The Norscans have raised from infancy a gargantuan Mammoth, brimming with the energies and mutations of Chaos.\\n\\nA huge, hulking monstrosity of raw power and strength, the Mammoth is a rare sight but for those tamed by the Norscans. Now this beast — whose tusks are longer than most men are tall — will reside among your company of monsters, as both a powerful weapon and a testament to your glory.	false
incidents_localised_description_wh2_twa03_incident_rakarth_settlement_norsca_wolves	The hardy Norscans fight with rage and fury, yet cannot stand against your might. Their snowy settlement falls to your forces and everything within it is now yours by right, including their ferocious canine pets.\\n\\nThese wolves are vicious, but no longer feral after being bred and tamed by the Norscans. All the easier for you to bend them to your will, and add them to the already expansive collection of beasts under your control. 	false
incidents_localised_description_wh2_twa03_incident_rakarth_settlement_ogres_sabretusks	The spoils of victory are eternally sweet! Penned away deep within the Ogre encampment, a pack of Sabretusks growl at your intrusion, bearing their monstrous fangs.\\n\\nTheir will is no match for your own, of course. It takes no time at all to break the beasts and bind them to your command. Their ghastly fangs shall soon be tearing into your foes, ripping them limb from bloody limb.	false

Azazel simply preens. As if such an outcome was ever in doubt? Truly, his victory was all but assured, for who could ever hope to match his greatness?\\n\\nNow leaving the Arena of Battle behind as its final champion, Azazel can bask eternally in the gratification of his victory. Moreover, the favour he has earned in Slaanesh's eyes will surely draw countless followers to his cause.

He will lead His agents of decadence in dominating the mortal plane, and ensure all who once pledged themselves to Order succumb to the allure of ecstasy.	false

incidents_localised_description_wh3_dlc23_chd_ancestor_relic_of_gazul_reward_a	The so-called Lord of Underearth holds no power in the Dark Lands! The Brazier of Gazul holds energy, however. That much cannot be denied. Bound to Daemonic powers and channelled into the Great Drill, your progress toward the Dark God's fiery realm will surely increase tenfold, bringing you ever closer to the Blood of Hashut!	false
incidents_localised_description_wh3_dlc23_chd_ancestor_relic_of_gazul_reward_b	Nothing puts the lie to the Ancestors' power like parading their relics through the beating heart of Zharr-Naggrund. Such a display of superiority is sure to impress the Conclave of Evil. They no doubt watch from the Temple of Hashut, as this relic of Gazul is marched through the streets and all gather to revel in your conquest.	false
incidents_localised_description_wh3_dlc23_chd_ancestor_relic_of_grimnir_reward_a	Your Daemonsmiths toil over wretched Grimnir's relic, binding the artefact to a Daemon and despoiling its energies with the potent corruption of Chaos. The Dawi's 'fearless warrior-god' will now serve to power the Great Drill, churning reality until Hashut's realm is finally within reach!	false
incidents_localised_description_wh3_dlc23_chd_ancestor_relic_of_grimnir_reward_b	The Dawi's pathetic warrior-god was nowhere to be seen when your forces crushed theirs, and nor did Grimnir strike the Dawi-Zharr down as they claimed his relic for Zharr-Naggrund. This puny Ancestor is clearly worth nothing! As proof, let his tarnished Golden Bands be paraded through the acrid smoke of your homeland, a trophy to the slaughter of your long-abandoned kin.	false
incidents_localised_description_wh3_dlc23_chd_ancestor_relic_of_grungni_reward_a	Bound with Daemonic energy, the Ever-Burning Helmet of Grungni now simmers with corruption. It seems fitting that the false God of Mining and Stonemasonry will power the Great Drill, fuelling its violent churning of the earth. Soon Hashut's molten realm shall be revealed, and the Ruinous magma that flows there will ensure the supremacy of the Uzkul-Dhrath-Zharr!	false
incidents_localised_description_wh3_dlc23_chd_ancestor_relic_of_grungni_reward_b	The Ever-Burning Helmet is paraded before the masses of Zharr-Naggrund, a shining symbol of your victory over the Dawi and the failure of their revered Ancestors. The Conclave of Evil cannot fail to recognise your strength, now that this token of Grungni's power has been thoroughly mocked and degraded by the Children of Hashut!	false
incidents_localised_description_wh3_dlc23_chd_ancestor_relic_of_morgrim_reward_a	The ancient Focal Lens of Morgrim has been bound to Daemonic powers, corrupted beyond recognition by the most talented Daemonsmiths of Zharr-Naggrund to siphon its magic. The Great Drill of Hashut is a machine even Morgrim himself could only have dreamed of creating, proving the artificers of the Dawi-Zharr are superior even to the Ancestors themselves!	false
incidents_localised_description_wh3_dlc23_chd_ancestor_relic_of_morgrim_reward_b	Why waste such an ancient and powerful relic when the Dawi-Zharr could wield its power instead? The Focal Lens of Morgrim will prove a boon to the engineers of our infernal empire, spurring them to produce the greatest war machines  known to any realm.\\n\\nNo wonder the crowds cheer as the relic is flaunted through the streets! One can only imagine the bloody carnage such dark engines will wreak...	false
incidents_localised_description_wh3_dlc23_chd_ancestor_relic_of_skavor_reward_a	Despoiled and disfigured by Daemonic binding, your Daemonsmiths have rendered the Runic Bracers of Skavor to be no more than mere fragments of Chaos. Through the efforts of sorcery and hellish science, they have been made one with the Great Drill of Hashut for eternity.\\n\\nMay their power fuel our drill, as it carves a path to the magma our Sorcerers desperately crave!	false
incidents_localised_description_wh3_dlc23_chd_ancestor_relic_of_skavor_reward_b	None can doubt your power when such a beacon of might and superiority is worn so proudly before the masses! Plucked from amongst the broken bodies of your foes, the Runic Bracers of Skavor will serve as a stark reminder of Dawi-Zharr dominance. Your enemies would surely weep... were they still alive to see it!	false
incidents_localised_description_wh3_dlc23_chd_ancestor_relic_of_smednir_reward_a	Daemon, hammer and drill are bound as one by the expert hands of the Hell-Workers. Whatever power this relic of the false-god Smednir once possessed, it has no doubt been multiplied by the endless energies of Chaos. Once the drilling commences, reality itself will be warped by its power, and core of the earth shall finally open to us!	false
incidents_localised_description_wh3_dlc23_chd_ancestor_relic_of_smednir_reward_b	The Conclave of Evil are no doubt impressed by your victory. How could they deny it, when the Hammer of Smednir is now wielded by the Dawi-Zharr? It is a testament to the strength and glory of the infernal empire, and a signal to all other races: the Children of Hashut care not for the whims of lesser gods, for fire and Chaos reign supreme!	false
incidents_localised_description_wh3_dlc23_chd_ancestor_relic_of_thungni_reward_a	The blazing core of the world awaits! With the Runic Tablet of Thungni powering the Great Drill, the Dawi-Zharr are one step closer to breaking through the planes of reality and into the heart of mighty Hashut's abode. Your Sorcerer-Prophets are beside themselves at the thought all the magma they may find, and the arcane evils that will no doubt ensue!	false
incidents_localised_description_wh3_dlc23_chd_ancestor_relic_of_thungni_reward_b	The Great Drill can wait! More important is the image of superiority you'll project when this long-lost talisman of the Dawi is on display before your peers. This is proof of your military domination! The upper echelons of the empire will have to take note, now your decimation of those weak-willed enemies of Chaos is clear to all. Moreover, our Daemonsmiths will surely find a way to put this tablet to good use.	false
incidents_localised_description_wh3_dlc23_chd_ancestor_relic_of_valaya_reward_a	There is a certain satisfaction to having the Healing Salve of Valaya so utterly tainted by Daemonic corruption. Imbued with the forces of Chaos and attached to the Great Drill, its power is undeniable. Soon it will reach down into molten rock and bring back the potent Blood of Hashut!	false
incidents_localised_description_wh3_dlc23_chd_ancestor_relic_of_valaya_reward_b	The enchanted Healing Salve is greeted by baying crowds and malevolent laughter in Zharr-Naggrund. Ripping such an ancient and esteemed relic from the hands of those weak-willed Dawi is surely a feat worth celebrating – particularly, a relic tied to their revered Valaya. They didn't have the strength to stop us, and now their precious artefact is on display – a symbol of their abject failure!	false

incidents_localised_description_wh3_dlc23_chd_convoy_convoy_spotted	A string of Caravans have been spotted brazenly making their way through our lands. Though their origin is yet undetermined, one thing is clear; this Convoy does not belong to the Dawi-Zharr. Whoever they are, they certainly have a lot of nerve!	false
incidents_localised_description_wh3_dlc23_chd_convoy_new_contracts	A shift in supply and demand for industrial commodities in the world has resulted in new Convoy contracts arising.\\n\\nIncoming and Outgoing options for Convoy destinations have now changed and will do so every 10 turns.	false
incidents_localised_description_wh3_dlc23_chd_convoy_ogres_strike_back	How fickle the Ogres are! Once offering their protection, the same group of Ogre mercenaries now ravage your Convoy in retaliation for your refusal; it seems they do not take rejection well. Clearly, there is only one way to put a stop to this indignity!	false
incidents_localised_description_wh3_dlc23_chd_convoy_portals_part_3_b	The battle is done, but it seems the cargo is not yet free for the taking. Another Daemon seems to have taken issue with you slaughtering his kin. A very large, very angry Daemon… One can only hope this cargo is worth it!	false
incidents_localised_description_wh3_dlc23_chd_convoy_unique_completed	Your Convoy returns bearing a worthy bounty, exchanged for the sweat of your empire's brow and the valuable products of its toil. One particular artefact catches the eye; perhaps it could be useful in the pursuit of your malevolent cause?	false
incidents_localised_description_wh3_dlc23_chd_convoy_unique_completed_bay_of_blades	Your Convoy has returned from the perilous Bay of Blades, where the Norscan tribes of Skaeling and Sarl settle their grievances in blood. No blood was spilled this time, however, and your trading party did not return empty-handed!	false
incidents_localised_description_wh3_dlc23_chd_convoy_unique_completed_black_crag	Your Convoy’s assignees relished the march to "Karak Drazh", the city once lost by the western Dwarfs’ craven antecedents. Now a symbol of Dwari-Thagi weakness, Black Crag provides an added delight with your returning Convoy's cargo; an arcane token of goodwill.	false
incidents_localised_description_wh3_dlc23_chd_convoy_unique_completed_castle_drakenhof	The imposing halls of Castle Drakenhof are well known for hiding all manner of sorcerous relics and items of the occult. Your Convoy has returned from its towering peaks with one such intriguing artefact, destined for use in Zharr-Naggrund.	false
incidents_localised_description_wh3_dlc23_chd_convoy_unique_completed_great_hall_of_greasus	The most lucrative trade route this side of Cathay offers great profit for those strong enough to endure its dangers. Your Convoy Master has not only proven himself up to the task, but also returns with a powerful item from the mercenaries of the Ivory Road.	false
incidents_localised_description_wh3_dlc23_chd_convoy_unique_completed_grung_zint	Traversing the Northern Grey Mountains is no easy feat, yet the hardy traders of your Convoy never faltered. Having successfully completed their dealings in Grung Zint, they return to our lands with a reward more than worthy of their treacherous journey.	false
incidents_localised_description_wh3_dlc23_chd_convoy_unique_completed_karond_kar	Your Convoy’s trip to Karond Kar’s vast Labourer markets on the other side of the world has elevated your status as an industrial superpower, but also provides an arcane boon. Amongst your returning Convoy’s goods is a magical artefact steeped in the powers of the Land of Chill.	false
incidents_localised_description_wh3_dlc23_chd_convoy_unique_completed_the_crystal_spires	The visit to the Crystal Spires has brought a most promising bounty! From the great and terrible Realm of Chaos, your Convoy has returned bearing a powerful object, steeped in the glorious energies of corruption.	false
incidents_localised_description_wh3_dlc23_chd_convoy_unique_completed_the_haunted_forest	The Haunted Forest holds no horrors for the Dawi-Zharr! Instead, the products of our empire's tireless labour have bought a unique prize from among those whispering trees. Perhaps it will be of benefit to Zharr-Naggrund, or perhaps, of benefit to you alone…	false
incidents_localised_description_wh3_dlc23_chd_convoy_unique_completed_the_palace_of_ruin	On their return from the Palace of Ruin in the desolate plains of the Chaos Wastes, your Convoy has brought a particular item of note to your attention. Returning with such an item is proof, they say, of their expedition's worth to the Dark Lands.	false
incidents_localised_description_wh3_dlc23_chd_convoy_unique_completed_the_silvered_tower_of_sorcerers	Your Convoy has returned from the Chaos Wastes with an impressive haul to show for their troubles. The Silvered Tower of Sorcerers had much to barter with, including a particularly powerful artefact your Overseer is certain you'll put to good use.	false
incidents_localised_description_wh3_dlc23_chd_convoy_unique_completed_the_volary	After their journey through the Eastern Steppes, your trading Convoys have finally returned, greeted by the smoke and noxious fumes of Zharr-Naggrund. They bring with them the offerings of the Volary, including one specific relic that was declared to be quite the rarity.	false
incidents_localised_description_wh3_dlc23_chd_convoy_unique_completed_titans_notch	Your Convoy has returned from Titan's Notch, bringing before you an item of particular splendour. It's valuable, if your Overseer is to be believed, and possibly the key to fuelling the expansion of our dark, industrious empire! Of course, he has been known to exaggerate.	false
incidents_localised_description_wh3_dlc23_chd_convoy_unique_completed_troll_fjord	Descending from the perilous Vanaheim Mountains, your Convoy carries a trove of wealth for their efforts. Your Overseer declares one particular commodity quite priceless; a boon to all Uzkul-Dhrath-Zharr. The visit to the Troll Fjord may have proven worthwhile indeed!	false
incidents_localised_description_wh3_dlc23_chd_convoy_unique_completed_wizard_caliphs_palace	It is said that there is little about the art of sorcery that the one known as the Wizard Caliph does not know. Avoiding the curses of his palace, your Convoy returns from Araby unscathed and successful in its dealings, with a treasure of the Caliph among its goods.	false
incidents_localised_description_wh3_dlc23_chd_convoy_unlocked	Convoy routes out of the Dark Lands are now available for use in the [[col:yellow]]Military Convoys[[/col]] panel. Such enterprise may help fuel your industry, but opportunity does not come without risk. 	false
incidents_localised_description_wh3_dlc23_chd_incident_a_strange_creature	The network of watchtowers that encircle Zharr-Naggrund report a small humanoid approaching from the west. Thinking it one of our cousins, we scramble to meet it, only to find that the curious creature has no beard and speaks a crude dialect that we Dawi-Zharr barely understand! Deciphering enough to get the gist of the matter, it would seem that the visitor is offering a bewildering array of food the likes of which are seldom seen here in the Dark Lands. Merrily, it continues on its way...	false
incidents_localised_description_wh3_dlc23_chd_incident_alchemical_progress	Hashut's work is surely done! After a long, hot night spent pouring over the grimoires and white-hot forges in the lava fields – and, naturally, the necessary (and exceedingly bloody) execution of more than one Greenskin Labourer – one of our Daemonsmiths has discovered a new blend of gunpowder to improve our ammunition... make everything go with a bang, you might say! Well, mainly just the enemy, if all goes to plan...	false
incidents_localised_description_wh3_dlc23_chd_incident_favour_of_hashut	It is clear now to all that our actions have pleased our dark master, the Bull-God Hashut, the Father of Darkness to whom all Dawi-Zharr pledge their every waking breath to serve. All within the Conclave of Evil know this to be the truth, and dare not challenge the signs, so our faction has gained significant influence within the echelons of power that rule over these grim Dark Lands.	false
incidents_localised_description_wh3_dlc23_chd_incident_frenzied_aggresssion	Although absolutely a good thing and far from being a matter of concern, reports from our commanders in the field tell us that Chaos Dwarf forces are showing even greater levels of aggression and heartless cruelty than even they can usually manage, desiring nothing more than to come face to face with the enemy at every opportunity, in an explosion of bloody violence! Hashut be praised – his blood shall flow across the Dark Lands, slaughtering the foe in sacrifice to the Father of Darkness!	false
incidents_localised_description_wh3_dlc23_chd_incident_labour_breakout	You'd never have thought it – a Goblin Labourer with enough brains and gumption to attempt insurrection? In a rare display of true cunning, a despicable, treacherous Goblin has led his hapless Greenskin companions in a minor revolt against their rightful masters. Naturally, it will have to be put down with extreme prejudice, followed by the obligatory gory public executions, of course, but who would want it any other way?	false
incidents_localised_description_wh3_dlc23_chd_incident_labour_surplus	One of our mines has recently run dry of Hashut's Blood, but we currently lack the capacity to transfer the pathetic Greenskin Labourers who worked the seam elsewhere. Clearly, there is nothing to be done but send them to the front, to die in battle against those who stand against the Chaos Dwarfs. Though I do not doubt that the regulars will complain, stentorian yelling and harsh punishments should ensure harmony is restored by the time the Greenskins are led onto the battlefield to face the foe – and most probably their own gory deaths!	false
incidents_localised_description_wh3_dlc23_chd_incident_mass_production	In service of Hashut, Father of Darkness, and in his bloody name, the Daemonsmiths have long been the progenitors of sorcerous and mechanical innovation within Dawi-Zharr society. Due to a recent breakthrough when applying the Lore of Hashut to their work, significant advances have now been made, for the good of all. This, in turn, has lead to a dramatic increase in productivity, making it possible for us to equip our warriors at a record pace!	false
incidents_localised_description_wh3_dlc23_chd_incident_pyroclastic_flow	During the endless search for the Blood of Hashut, on the instructions of the Conclave, our mining drills have been driven even further into the ground than ever before, cracking the earth and breaking through to a rich seam of molten lava – the very Blood of Hashut! Now, the blazing torrent of molten lava spills onto the surface like a glorious river of gold. Praise be to the Father of Darkness – hallowed be his unholy name!	false
incidents_localised_description_wh3_dlc23_chd_incident_shapeshifters	On nine separate occasions, sentries from every corner of our great Dawi-Zharr empire have reported seeing a powerful Sorcerer who told them that inescapable change is coming. While the troops in question all give wildly different physical descriptions of the mysterious magic-user, their reports of his words are near identical. Something is coming... and we must be ready to exploit the situation immediately, and to our best advantage!	false
incidents_localised_description_wh3_dlc23_chd_incident_sulfurous_smoke	A particularly efficacious type of coal has been burned in the furnaces of late. Usefully, the smoke this has produced burns the flesh of any who walk through it, which has got the cruel, cunning brains of the Dawi-Zharr working even faster than is usual. Though we Chaos Dwarfs are naturally unfazed by such things, due to being of the hardiest Dwarfen stock of all, our foes will not be so fortunate, which shall be a pleasure to behold!	false
incidents_localised_description_wh3_dlc23_chd_incident_the_long_march	The naturally superior road and rail systems of the Chaos Dwarf Empire are unparalleled anywhere in the Old World – better even than the technical advances achieved by those soft, weak Empire men to the west, so it would appear. Preeminent Dawi organisational skills will of course mean we can use the network to move our armies and Labour Convoys faster and further around our territory, to the continual advancement of Hashut's blessed children!	false

incidents_localised_description_wh3_dlc25_incident_machinations_emp_negative_1	Wagons full of imperial goods frequently depart to foreign lands. A particularly large convoy disappeared, however. An investigation found the merchants and guards tied to trees and all the wagons plundered. The foreign lord denies any responsibility, but even a child knows that he is to blame for not keeping the roads clear.	false
incidents_localised_description_wh3_dlc25_incident_machinations_emp_negative_2	A noble has managed to get himself in an embarrassing position. While a foreign dignitary was visiting, rumours started circulating that the noble was ridiculing the foreign delegation behind their backs and even hired a few jesters to give a private performance to mock them. Of course the noble denied it, but a few days later, a letter addressed to his wife surfaced, in which he expressed his disdain for the foreign dignitary. The delegation departed at once and spread the stories of their mistreatment back home.	false
incidents_localised_description_wh3_dlc25_incident_machinations_emp_negative_3	The wife of a local baron went missing without a trace. Weeks pass and searches return nothing. At the next full moon however, she is found dead and mutilated, hanging above the city gate. A letter was stuffed into her throat, with another faction expressing their hatred for the baron and claiming responsibility.	false

incidents_localised_description_wh3_dlc25_incident_machinations_emp_positive_2	An exotic Caravan appears in mankind's realm, claiming to be from a foreign kingdom. Their goods are of high quality and their prices low. Intrigued by the opportunities of trade, merchants soon flock to the foreign territory in the hopes of securing a good deal.	false
incidents_localised_description_wh3_dlc25_incident_machinations_emp_positive_3	Seemingly random lords received an invitation of a tournament hosted near Nuln. Upon arrival, they discovered that the tournament grounds have been set up and a foreign delegation was already present. But the foreigners claim they received a similar invitation, and no-one knows who is the host, nor how the tournament grounds were erected. A crate with a massive golden trophy is soon discovered. Both sides agree to compete honourably, with the winning faction receiving the trophy. After the festivities end, both sides agree they had a great time together and the tournament should become an annual event.	false
incidents_localised_description_wh3_dlc25_incident_machinations_hef_negative_1a	While they can be blunt, the Asur tend to veil insults through the arts.

incidents_localised_description_wh3_dlc25_incident_machinations_hef_negative_2a	There is a constant fear that anyone in Ulthuan could be one of the Witch King’s agents in deep cover. It is almost too easy to lay a whispered suggestion that the life partner of {{CcoCampaignEventIncident:SecondTargetName}} of {{CcoCampaignEventIncident:SecondTargetFactionName}} takes orders from Naggarond.

incidents_localised_description_wh3_dlc25_incident_machinations_hef_negative_2b	To accuse {{CcoCampaignEventIncident:FirstTargetFactionName}} of worshipping the gods of the underworld is a serious charge. Although not technically illegal, it is frowned upon, and the loss of standing in the Phoenix Court will be quick.

incidents_localised_description_wh3_dlc25_incident_machinations_hef_negative_3a	The Cults of Pleasure are insidious.

The talk is untrue, of course, but the more they deny, the faster the rumour spreads.	false
incidents_localised_description_wh3_dlc25_incident_machinations_hef_negative_3b	The most effective way to damage relationships is to insinuate rather than use a Dawi’s bluntness.

As we intended.	false
incidents_localised_description_wh3_dlc25_incident_machinations_hef_positive_1a	A careful discussion here, a subtle word over wine there, a smile that lingers, an eyebrow raised over a jest - all things men and Dwarfs would never pick up on.

incidents_localised_description_wh3_dlc25_incident_machinations_hef_positive_1d	Business at the Phoenix Court rarely happens while the king attends and deals with matters of state. It is when the Princes and Nobles splinter off to the alcoves and form informal sub-committees that things get done and so, over a few cups of wine, the binding of {{CcoCampaignEventIncident:FirstTargetFactionName}} and {{CcoCampaignEventIncident:SecondTargetFactionName}} can begin.	false
incidents_localised_description_wh3_dlc25_incident_machinations_hef_positive_2a	Finubar’s war council is not an official organisation, more the Phoenix King’s close associates that guide and advise on matters of war.

His painstaking effort in explaining the contract, however, lets him preserve a measure of dignity.[[/i]]\\n\\n{{tr:ui_text_replacements_localised_text_mercenary_contracts_view_panel}}	false
incidents_localised_description_wh3_dlc26_incident_merc_contract_new_wh2_main_lzd_lizardmen_1	[[i]]The Lizardmen envoy has been achingly particular as to when the contract should be delivered, whom he should give it to and whether it should be received in the right hand or the left. Nothing less would do in the name of the Great Plan. The Mercenaries are nonplussed: could it just be the Good-Enough Plan? Those have always worked well in the past, after all...[[/i]]\\n\\n{{tr:ui_text_replacements_localised_text_mercenary_contracts_view_panel}}	false
incidents_localised_description_wh3_dlc26_incident_merc_contract_new_wh2_main_lzd_lizardmen_2	[[i]]The Scar-Veteran leading the Lizardmen emissaries is capable of meeting an Ogre's gaze at eye level, which Ogres usually consider a challenge. Before they can issue one, however, he shifts his body slightly, whereupon the rest of the Lizardmen warriors rearrange themselves in a manner vaguely threatening enough for the Mercenaries to remember that, in fact, they have met to come to an agreement, not blows.[[/i]]\\n\\n{{tr:ui_text_replacements_localised_text_mercenary_contracts_view_panel}}	false
incidents_localised_description_wh3_dlc26_incident_merc_contract_new_wh2_main_skv_skaven_1	[[i]]The absence of Skaven on the morning after the company's feast is even more conspicuous than usual. They certainly were there before, but they are even more certainly not here now. Yet, there are scratch-marks on the cauldron. Is this… writing? A contract?[[/i]]\\n\\n{{tr:ui_text_replacements_localised_text_mercenary_contracts_view_panel}}	false
incidents_localised_description_wh3_dlc26_incident_merc_contract_new_wh2_main_skv_skaven_2	[[i]]The Skaven who have come to present the terms of the client have, unsurprisingly, been denied access to the cauldron's contents; instead, a few Gnoblars have been persuaded to entertain the envoys by taking part in some pigback jousting upon the visitors' backs, whereupon they are quickly whisked off into the night, screaming in confusion.[[/i]]\\n\\n{{tr:ui_text_replacements_localised_text_mercenary_contracts_view_panel}}	false
incidents_localised_description_wh3_dlc26_incident_merc_contract_new_wh3_dlc23_chd_chaos_dwarfs_1	[[i]]From the outside, any Dwarf impinging on an Ogre's stomping grounds might seem like an invitation to a literal stomping, but Chaos Dwarfs are well-known to Ogre Mercenaries for both their toughness and their willingness to provide contract work. Their wealth is supremely tempting, their miserly demeanour supremely frustrating. The promise of riches usually prevails.[[/i]]\\n\\n{{tr:ui_text_replacements_localised_text_mercenary_contracts_view_panel}}	false
incidents_localised_description_wh3_dlc26_incident_merc_contract_new_wh3_dlc23_chd_chaos_dwarfs_2	[[i]]The foul runes carved on the obsidian plate of the contract makes one's eyes bleed, but the terms inscribed on it makes one's eyes weep with avaricious joy also. The rewards are handily etched as images underneath the writing, whose pain-inducing properties might simply be what the Chaos Dwarfs consider the receipt of transaction.[[/i]]\\n\\n{{tr:ui_text_replacements_localised_text_mercenary_contracts_view_panel}}	false
incidents_localised_description_wh3_dlc26_incident_merc_contract_new_wh3_main_cth_cathay_1	[[i]]Grand Cathay's missive is accompanied by an immaculate line of warriors in finely-lacquered armour, their faces just as impassive. They make no move, waiting for the company's representative to come to them instead. The stalemate continues well into the night, until a Gnoblar drenched in fear-sweat takes the contract and brings it back to the camp.[[/i]]\\n\\n{{tr:ui_text_replacements_localised_text_mercenary_contracts_view_panel}}	false
incidents_localised_description_wh3_dlc26_incident_merc_contract_new_wh3_main_cth_cathay_2	[[i]]A sudden explosion at dawn has sent the company into an uproar. On the outskirts of the camp, at the bottom of a crater, they find a small jade casket with a contract inside. The Ogres squint at the clear sky in vain. Nevertheless, the shrewder among them feel they're being watched.[[/i]]\\n\\n{{tr:ui_text_replacements_localised_text_mercenary_contracts_view_panel}}	false
incidents_localised_description_wh3_dlc26_incident_merc_contract_new_wh3_main_ksl_kislev_1	[[i]]A company of grizzled Kislevite veterans has delivered an offer from their masters. The Mercenaries are intrigued by the Kislevites' scars and missing limbs. The chief perpetrator seems to be frostbite – but also, too many desperate battles for these leather-skinned men to count on their slightly fingerless hands.[[/i]]\\n\\n{{tr:ui_text_replacements_localised_text_mercenary_contracts_view_panel}}	false
incidents_localised_description_wh3_dlc26_incident_merc_contract_new_wh3_main_ksl_kislev_2	[[i]]The Mercenaries are disappointed to see no Bears of any sort among the Kislevite messengers. The messengers themselves know they could not risk instigating an Ogre-Bear brawl where the only ones seriously hurt would be themselves. Some, however, are tempted to send a delegation consisting solely of Bears next time, for they consider their revered animals at least as strong as an Ogre, and definitely smarter.[[/i]]\\n\\n{{tr:ui_text_replacements_localised_text_mercenary_contracts_view_panel}}	false
incidents_localised_description_wh3_dlc26_incident_merc_contract_new_wh3_main_ogr_ogre_kingdoms_1	[[i]]Disagreements over meat and gold owed are to be expected when Ogre Mercenaries negotiate with… anyone, really, but only when the client is another Ogre tribe does the back-and-forth take on the savoury tang of murderous camaraderie that promises (or threatens) to conclude negotiations without even having spoken of the enemy.[[/i]]\\n\\n{{tr:ui_text_replacements_localised_text_mercenary_contracts_view_panel}}	false
incidents_localised_description_wh3_dlc26_incident_merc_contract_new_wh3_main_ogr_ogre_kingdoms_2	[[i]]While most clients offer Ogre Mercenaries contracts to redress a grievance, be it real or imagined, other Ogres do this as a challenge. They take care to list all the ways in which they have made their puny enemy suffer, something the Mercenaries could not possibly achieve. As reward, they would even stake some of their hard-earned meat and battle prizes. Needless to say, most such contracts are word-of-mouth, and are sealed with a handful of broken teeth.[[/i]]\\n\\n{{tr:ui_text_replacements_localised_text_mercenary_contracts_view_panel}}	false
incidents_localised_description_wh3_dlc26_incident_merc_contract_new_wh_dlc05_wef_wood_elves_1	[[i]]The Wood Elves who deliver the contract are confusingly stoic, to the point where the Mercenaries start wondering whether their masters would miss them if they were to become dinner. Before the troop can make up its mind, a horn rings out in the distance and the strangers are gone as quickly as they'd appeared.[[/i]]\\n\\n{{tr:ui_text_replacements_localised_text_mercenary_contracts_view_panel}}	false
incidents_localised_description_wh3_dlc26_incident_merc_contract_new_wh_dlc05_wef_wood_elves_2	[[i]]The Wood Elves seem annoyed by their mission, idly going over the specifics as quickly as possible, clearly disgusted at being in the presence of Ogres. A few of the Maneaters aren’t appreciating this veiled rudeness but are also aware that the forest is watching them, and one unsavoury move could result in a shower of arrows. Better to just accept the contract and let the bony morsels leave in one piece, this time…[[/i]]\\n\\n{{tr:ui_text_replacements_localised_text_mercenary_contracts_view_panel}}	false
incidents_localised_description_wh3_dlc26_incident_merc_contract_new_wh_dlc08_nor_norsca_1	[[i]]The Norscan envoys are nowhere to be seen. The Mercenaries find themselves in the middle of a fresh battlefield, nameless corpses heaped haphazardly at one end. The contract is written in blood and entrails on the ground. Some of it the Ogres have already started cooking, but there is enough left to understand the gist.[[/i]]\\n\\n{{tr:ui_text_replacements_localised_text_mercenary_contracts_view_panel}}	false
incidents_localised_description_wh3_dlc26_incident_merc_contract_new_wh_dlc08_nor_norsca_2	[[i]]As soon as the Ogres reach the meeting place, battle is joined. The Norscans scream out their client's demands in between strikes. The Mercenaries are put through its paces but are relieved to find it less of a challenge than if they had to *read* the blasted thing.[[/i]]\\n\\n{{tr:ui_text_replacements_localised_text_mercenary_contracts_view_panel}}	false
incidents_localised_description_wh3_dlc26_incident_merc_contract_new_wh_main_brt_bretonnia_1	[[i]]The Bretonnians delivering the contract are met with an elaborate tale, by way of greeting, of an Ogre who managed to devour an entire Knight Errant, horse, lance and armour included. The envoys' expressions at hearing this would sour even Grail water. And no, even if their rewards include Knightly equipment, they never include the Knight.[[/i]]\\n\\n{{tr:ui_text_replacements_localised_text_mercenary_contracts_view_panel}}	false
incidents_localised_description_wh3_dlc26_incident_merc_contract_new_wh_main_brt_bretonnia_2	[[i]]A complement of glowering Knights watches from the shadows as a single Grail Damsel presents Bretonnia's offer to the company around the campfire. Afterwards, she ventures a tale, as she has heard it is customary among Ogres. Some are loudly impressed, whereas others become inexplicably silent. All rise as she takes her leave.[[/i]]\\n\\n{{tr:ui_text_replacements_localised_text_mercenary_contracts_view_panel}}	false
incidents_localised_description_wh3_dlc26_incident_merc_contract_new_wh_main_dwf_dwarfs_1	[[i]]A contingent of Dwarf Slayers has delivered a contract from their Lord. Do they know what's in it? No. Do they care? No. Would they themselves enforce the terms should the Ogres fall short? Probably not – Ogre Mercenaries are not nearly worthy enough to fight Slayers, and a Dragon has been spied some miles hence…[[/i]]\\n\\n{{tr:ui_text_replacements_localised_text_mercenary_contracts_view_panel}}	false
incidents_localised_description_wh3_dlc26_incident_merc_contract_new_wh_main_dwf_dwarfs_2	[[i]]The terms are simple and concise: A contract fulfilled would provide ample remuneration (within reasonable bounds).

incidents_localised_description_wh3_dlc26_incident_merc_contract_new_wh_main_emp_empire_1	[[i]]As they meet the Imperial delegation, the members of the company are confused as to why one of their number is part of it. Later, it turns out it is not an Ogre Mercenary dressed in scavenged human clothing, but an actual denizen of the Empire. It is unclear whether his presence would predispose them towards or against the offer they are about to receive.[[/i]]\\n\\n{{tr:ui_text_replacements_localised_text_mercenary_contracts_view_panel}}	false
incidents_localised_description_wh3_dlc26_incident_merc_contract_new_wh_main_emp_empire_2	[[i]]The Gold Wizard accompanying the Imperial envoys is almost certainly meant to convey the wealth at the client's disposal, but does everything in his power to express his displeasure at the task, to the collective annoyance of both the Ogre Mercenaries and the Imperials with him. The Burgher in the delegation concludes the negotiations before the Wizard has the chance to transmute the Ogres' cauldron into some prancing, meat-spewing monstrosity.[[/i]]\\n\\n{{tr:ui_text_replacements_localised_text_mercenary_contracts_view_panel}}	false
incidents_localised_description_wh3_dlc26_incident_merc_contract_new_wh_main_grn_greenskins_1	[[i]]The company finds the Greenskin emissaries bickering amongst themselves some distance outside the camp. Their shouts, their garish paint and their smell constitute a perfectly coordinated assault on the senses. Luckily, Ogres are well-known for possessing the perfect countermeasures to all that, both in scarcity of mind and surfeit of body. The negotiations proceed surprisingly smoothly.[[/i]]\\n\\n{{tr:ui_text_replacements_localised_text_mercenary_contracts_view_panel}}	false
incidents_localised_description_wh3_dlc26_incident_merc_contract_new_wh_main_grn_greenskins_2	[[i]]The Greenskins' contract is conveyed by a raving Goblin Shaman whose words defy the Mercenaries' collective knowledge of foreign tongues. Upon deciding that what they hear is more akin to the sounds of a dying Squig than it is to speech, they take the piece of parchment from his hand and leave him to his confabulation with the nearby rocks and roots.[[/i]]\\n\\n{{tr:ui_text_replacements_localised_text_mercenary_contracts_view_panel}}	false
incidents_localised_description_wh3_dlc26_incident_merc_contract_new_wh_main_vmp_vampire_counts_1	[[i]]Relentless hunger and the rule of the strongest are two things that Mercenary Ogres and the Vampire Counts have in common. However, the two hungers are not nearly alike, and neither is their understanding of strength. When they meet, they discover the third, and crucial, thing that binds them: their skill for turning misery into profit.[[/i]]\\n\\n{{tr:ui_text_replacements_localised_text_mercenary_contracts_view_panel}}	false
incidents_localised_description_wh3_dlc26_incident_merc_contract_new_wh_main_vmp_vampire_counts_2	[[i]]A huge pile of meat lies before the company, yet fires will not start. Instead of the now-useless firewood, the Ogres stare at a stone cairn where a Wight King stands and delivers its client's terms, weapons drawn. Although hunger churns in their guts, the Mercenaries do not move. Then, as the creature begins its speech anew, they turn their backs and sullenly start munching on the raw meat. The Wight King continues speaking until early morning when it departs, disappearing mid-sentence.[[/i]]\\n\\n{{tr:ui_text_replacements_localised_text_mercenary_contracts_view_panel}}	false

It emits a distant but constant scream.	false
incidents_localised_description_wh3_main_incident_kho_copycat_killers	A Norscan Shaman reports a vision of a far-off kingdom razed to ash, its every inhabitant slaughtered, of nothing left but a mountain of skulls.

incidents_localised_description_wh3_main_incident_kho_unbreakable	Khorne's legion is waylaid upon a mountainside by Dwarfs.

incidents_localised_description_wh3_main_incident_ksl_mother_earth	Many believe that the Motherland is alive, and loves her people as they love her. When disease claims the lives of every man, woman and child in five stanitsas, the icy wind takes on a new timbre, one that sounds like a sorrowful howl. The land will surely make amends.	false
incidents_localised_description_wh3_main_incident_ksl_one_motherland	Though Kislev stands as one in the eyes of the world, in truth the Motherland is riddled with sedition.

incidents_localised_description_wh3_main_incident_ksl_state_scholarship	Officially, the Ice Court only accepts young women of noble lineage, for only they deserve its timeless wisdom.

incidents_localised_description_wh3_main_incident_nur_bird_flu	Your plague-scientists have been busy. From their squalid laboratories they birth a brand new contagion, one they proudly dub 'Raven Rot'. Remorselessly, the pox ravages eldritch feathers and chews at ectoplasmic flesh.

incidents_localised_description_wh3_main_incident_nur_the_circle_of_life	Many equate Nurgle with death, but this is to misunderstand His intent. He desires rebirth, so that more death may follow. So it is that He raises the bones of the long-dead, and from them sprouts bilious flesh. Nurgle's newest children strike up their buzzing drone, and the cycle begins anew.	false
incidents_localised_description_wh3_main_incident_nur_the_fly_lord	The earth of every town, every village, every field and every forest simultaneously sprouts a single Nurgling.

incidents_localised_description_wh3_main_incident_ogr_ruinous_rumours	Though Gnoblars are highly irritating creatures, the larger ones have occasional moments of brilliance.

incidents_localised_description_wh3_main_incident_sla_pay_the_piper	One of your Daemonettes exudes an irresistible new scent.

incidents_localised_description_wh3_main_minor_cult_crimson_plague_2	Disaster strikes. In their impudence, the Covenant has unleashed a mephitic plague across your lands, trailing suffering in its wake. Pox-ridden acolytes allege that their stores of bloated carcasses were merely part of a grandiose gift that only the controlled presence of carrion could bestow. Surely, the source of this pestilence must be scoured from the earth!	false
incidents_localised_description_wh3_main_minor_cult_crimson_plague_3	The Covenant has succeeded. Their hidden agenda is brought to sickly light as missives flood in from lands near and far: a catastrophic scourge has been unleashed through their profane organisation. Its horrifying hallmark is now seen in every land: a mound of plague-ridden corpses undergoing a horrific amalgamation, its bulk suffused into a writhing mantle of flesh and the fleeting impressions of a grimace, equal parts pain and reverence. Now and then, the surface morphs into grotesque ridges and hollows, and a face slowly emerges near the top; its jaw distended, forever split into an eerie, drooling moan toward the uncaring heavens.\\n\\nChillingly, every report ends the same: "This is the tenth such flesh-heap we have seen today."	false
incidents_localised_description_wh3_main_minor_cult_intro	An unusual site has been discovered near one of your settlements, warranting an investigation to determine its potential benefit.

incidents_localised_description_wh3_main_minor_cult_myrmidia	When demolishing the old Myrmidian Monastery, your workers discover a small cavity in the foundations of the building, with a locked chest buried deep within. Inside is a bundles of dusty old scrolls. The language written on them is far too complex to immediately decipher, so their purpose remains unknown. However, your scholars will persevere and uncover its meaning. In the meantime, they postulate that those who went to such great lengths to conceal this item may now be lost to time, along with their secrets, and it may take many lifetimes for this writing to finally be understood.\\t	false
incidents_localised_description_wh3_main_minor_cult_purple_hand_cult_complete	Staring at the mesmerising pattern on the walls of the Purple Hand's now hollowed-out coven, you recall how language strained under their undulating voices into a near-foreign dissonance. Veiled in such cacophony, their assurances were hard to trust – or indeed, to discern as promises at all.\\n\\nAssenting to their hypnotic practices and curious enough to dabble, you have wrested a maddeningly simple cypher from the fluorescent vortex of their conversations. It alone was able to reveal the contents of the irregularly cut piece of vellum resting on the sermon dais.\\n\\nThe elegant, shifting script is unnervingly direct: "Your assistance was instrumental. Our Grand Design unfolds. We shall see you again... very shortly."	false

incidents_localised_description_wh3_main_minor_cult_sartosan_vault	From beneath a sea-bitten tricorn nested in a matted snarl of hair, the shifty gaze of this hirsute vagabond probes for any sign of gullibility as he spins his captivating yarn.\\n\\nHis proposition, when it comes, is a simple one. He has heard of your 'vault' and requires a discreet place to store his recent acquisitions. He gestures to the gem-studded casing of his ill-got gains, offering a hefty sum for your trouble. But as he speaks, you cannot help but wonder: is the true price the gold he offers, or the inevitable wrath of whomever owned this treasure first?	false
incidents_localised_description_wh3_main_minor_cult_skaven	The Cult of the Yellow Fang has sent a messenger from their sewer hideout. He hands over a chest to a guard firmly clutching his sword, who stops short of drawing it and instead peers inside. Amongst the items inside is a scroll. Once unravelled, a message can just about be made out, scribbled in poorly-formed sentences... "With thanks from your local Yellow Fang friend and ally... Please accept this gift as a token of my appreciation for all efforts relating to 'you know what'...". Unfortunately there's no explanation of exactly which efforts he is referring to. However, the message does appear to be genuine, and what's more, what is inside the chest is quite a strange gift!	false
incidents_localised_description_wh3_main_minor_cult_wine	While passing through your lands, your forces are approached by a wine merchant, a middle-aged lady calling herself Marlene. Although she appears somewhat aged, it is clear that there's a youthful vigour about her, perhaps beyond what might be expected. In fact, such curiosity is soon confirmed as she offers to sell some of what she calls her "Dreamwine" for a very reasonable price, explaining that drinking it brings good health, long life and a youthful appearance. A small amount of coin is exchanged for the dark, syrupy vintage and she soon leaves, heading in the direction of the nearby vineyard...\\t	false

I have used the lore of the Tome to hasten our route.	false

incidents_localised_description_wh3_main_story_panel_ascension_coming	The Tome of Fates flares. It sends me a grave warning that we must act soon. Using the Daemonic machinery within the Forge of Souls fuelled by the remnants of Ursun, Be'lakor feasts! Where one God dies another shall be born. The Chaos God of Shadows…\\n\\nBe'lakor cannot be allowed to ascend for all will fear his wrath, whether Daemon or mortal!	false
incidents_localised_description_wh3_main_story_panel_ascension_imminent	We have but moments before Be'lakor becomes a God and dooms us all. The Tome is adamant: there is no other fate unless we move to stop him at the Forge of Souls… This is my last warning. Act now.	false
incidents_localised_description_wh3_main_story_panel_failure	Your trial within the Realm of Chaos has ended in failure. The Tome of Fates hungers yet we have no Daemon Prince soul to feed it. Yet its pages show me that your rivals have managed to harvest a soul for themselves.\\n\\nWithout the souls, Be'lakor will remain out of reach. We must return to the Realm of Chaos at the next opportunity...	false

Four domains ruled by their cruel masters: Nurgle, the Master of Plagues; Slaanesh, the Lord of Excess; Tzeentch, the Changer of Ways; and Khorne, the Blood God.\\n\\nWe must visit each realm and steal a soul from a Daemon Prince.

We must act with haste.	false
incidents_localised_description_wh3_main_story_panel_the_first_soul	The Tome of Fates is sated. We have our first Daemon Prince soul. There is little time to revel in the glory of what we have achieved, for we require three more souls if we are to illuminate the Bridge of Shadows and reach the Dark Master in his lair at the Forge of Souls.	false
incidents_localised_description_wh3_main_story_panel_the_fourth_soul	We have the final soul required to illuminate the path of the Forge. Yet events overtake us, great one. The God-Bear is dead – he will roar no more and reality itself can no longer be contained. Rifts tear through the veil and Daemons flood the mortal world.\\n\\nThis was always part of Be'lakor's plan. He ascends to Godhood... there is no place for us in his grand vision. He must be stopped.	false
incidents_localised_description_wh3_main_story_panel_the_lost_soul	We look upon the mortal lands once again having ventured into the Realm of Chaos.\\n\\nBut we return empty-handed. The Tome of Fates requires the twisted souls of Daemon Princes if we are to illuminate the hidden path to the Forge, where Be'lakor lurks.\\n\\nWe are not the only ones who seek the dying God. They employ their own methods to cross the veil into the Realm of Chaos. We must act with haste.	false
incidents_localised_description_wh3_main_story_panel_the_second_soul	Good! Another soul is ours, contained within the Tome of Fates.\\n\\nIt would be much easier if we could collect the essence of any Daemon, but a true soul only comes from those with mortal origins. That is why we must slay Daemon Princes, for their soul-stuff – no matter how wretched – comes from a creature that was once mortal.\\n\\nSo, to complete this great task, we must hunt down two more Daemonic Princelings.	false
incidents_localised_description_wh3_main_story_panel_the_third_soul	A third soul is now lies fettered in the pages of my book. Yet Be'lakor, previously consumed by his own machinations, now strikes out at the threats arrayed against him!\\n\\nGears turn in the Forge of Souls once more, and the Dark Master sends forth armies of Soul Grinders under his command.

Now, I truly earn my fee!\\n\\nAnd yet, a gateway opens both ways…\\n\\nWhile we may traverse the rifts to enter the Realm of Chaos, or even be transported to far flung areas of this world... we must close the gateways not required or the Daemontide that flows forth will lay your lands in Ruin!	false
incidents_localised_description_wh3_main_story_panel_ursuns_roar_imminent_1	Ah, the Tome flickers to life; fates will clash, Ursun will roar again!\\n\\nThe power it shall unleash will see more rifts open.

incidents_localised_description_wh_dlc02_incident_all_charge_carnage	Many conflicts are won or lost on the strength of the first, vicious charge. Men are sent flying from the battlefield, often in pieces, even before the savagery of melee begins. A well-timed charge shatters enemy morale, as well as bodies. Blood and sweat may coat the victors, but victory is always painted in colours such as these. Those at the head of the charge seek ever greater thrills, ever more bloodshed. As the battles become bigger, the body count grows higher and the trickles of blood become ever-flowing rivers of red.	false
incidents_localised_description_wh_dlc02_incident_all_magic_carnage	The world yields to those who master the Winds of Magic. Great bolts from the heavens scour souls from bodies, whilst raging torrents of fire rend the very flesh from bone. Magic can rip enemies into a dozen pieces or leave nothing but an ugly bloodstain where once they stood. The power granted by the cataclysm, many eons ago, can be harnessed now to bring ruin and destruction upon our enemies. All those who feel the pull of Magic feel it grow as the world festers under Chaos’ Ruinous gaze; their need to ravage grows stronger and stronger by the hour.	false
incidents_localised_description_wh_dlc02_incident_all_weapon_carnage	Battle is a blood-soaked affair. Limbs severed, bones exposed; men left for dead in the cruor-soaked fields amongst scores of fallen friends and enemies. Strong weapons, forged with time, sweat and expertise, mark the difference between victory and defeat. A good sword cuts clean through bone, severing heads and limbs, where lesser weapons will merely maim. As instability grows across the world, so too does man’s bloodlust and his desire for war and carnage on an ever-grander scale.	false

In its wake come the beasts - reptiles, mewling cats, frenzied cattle, boars and others driven mad by something they have witnessed deep in the forest. The Famine-fiend stalks the land, emerging from the woods to leaving nothing but barren wastes and withered crops in his wake - for that is Slugtongue's curse.	false

The Gods will be pleased, for their children have done well, but what now for the Cloven Ones? There is still much to do. While mankind’s sovereigns have been slaughtered and their champion’s corpses tossed on a raging pyre, the remnants of this pitiful race still live.

Music and dancing earlier in the evening would give way to darker and carnal pursuits later on.\\n\\nVlad hosts another masqued ball, the first for centuries, where Vampires and willing mortal nobles will receive a smidgen of power in return for their eternal servitude.

incidents_localised_description_wh_dlc05_incident_wef_from_good_stock	The forest provides for those who do it great service.

The information contained therein will help shape the future of all Asrai...	false
incidents_localised_description_wh_dlc05_incident_wef_official_masque_business	The Eternal Realms of Athel Loren are led by great Lords and Ladies, who in turn feel a responsibility for their Elven subjects.

Of course, such ventures are never, ever cheap...	false
incidents_localised_description_wh_dlc05_incident_wef_only_one	The greatest shock for the Asrai was the discovery that they were not alone in the forests - the Beastmen hordes had made squalid dens amongst the trees. For centuries the two have fought for ownership of the woods. Long have they fought, with not even the climactic Battle of Anguish enough to cease the conflict...	false
incidents_localised_description_wh_dlc05_incident_wef_the_dreamer_of_dreams	The Dreaming Woods, Athel Caiellin, is a forbidden place ruled by the worshippers of Slaanesh.

This one has walked through the fires of insanity, and found an ethereal strength on the other side...	false
incidents_localised_description_wh_dlc05_incident_wef_the_forge_of_starlight	There is one domain of Athel Loren regarded as the home of the smiths; the Forge of Starlight.

incidents_localised_description_wh_dlc05_incident_wef_the_wild_heath	At the height of the season of growth, the forests of Athel Loren push rebelliously past the Waystone fence and into the tracts of heath and scrub that border the mystical woods. Such boundless enthusiasm is admirable, but equilibrium must be maintained. All Asrai are predisposed in the management of the forest; things may move a little slower until Athel Loren is... curtailed.	false
incidents_localised_description_wh_dlc05_incident_wef_vengeance_of_the_asrai	Against the boundaries of the Waystone fence, interlopers have come with their weapons of war.

incidents_localised_description_wh_dlc06_dwf_belegar_ironhammer_shield_of_defiance_stage_1.2	With Belegar's forces in control of the area, an extensive search is carried out. Urk trails are quickly found that lead to previously hidden entrances to the Underway. Such portals are new, and far beyond the skills of the Greenskins to create, but are undoubtedly in use by their sworn enemies. Belegar doesn't like this deduction at all - it suggests coercion or, at the worst, even treason. Either fate is a great sin in the eyes of the Ancestors.	false

incidents_localised_description_wh_dlc07_incident_greenskin_rebelions	Your people live in fear, for evil stalks fair Bretonnia. The Greenskins that infest the mountains and forests harass and raid the surrounding villages with ever-greater violence. Now they mass in the hills the people fear a greater incursion – control is decreasing across the land as a result. Hold out, if you think the kingdom robust enough – in the hope that they tire and skulk back to their hideouts – or lead a force to destroy their settlements, end their attacks and wipe them out for good.	false

Fresh meat brings new strength to your warhird!    	false

incidents_localised_description_wh_dlc08_qb_nor_monster_hunt_0_stage_3b	The elite of your Marauder Hunters were sent out into the mountains to search for the Chaos Frost Dragon, but none returned! Maybe the weather was just too unforgiving, even for hardened warriors like them. Or perhaps they found the target – or it found them, rather – and fell victim to it. Still, the hunt must be seen through.

The Goblins were about to make stew out of him, but your Hero was able to cause a distraction and rescue him, snatching the naked prisoner right out of the large man-sized cauldron they had placed him in to be boiled alive. Your opportunistic servant also managed to grab some of the Goblins’ loot on his way out, making the mission more than worthwhile.	false

Having heard of one very belligerent Giant called Blorgar the Mad Titan terrorising the Grey Mountains, you set out to slay the leviathan for a great sacrifice, for what can be more impressive than bringing down a legendary descendant of the long-forgotten Sky-Titans?\\n\\nOnce you’d arrived in the Grey Mountains, however, Blorgar was nowhere to be seen. The only chance of gaining any useful information of the Giant’s whereabouts lay with a Bretonnian herb collector who’d allegedly stumbled upon an underground lair while spelunking nearby. Unfortunately this Bretonnian had been taken hostage by some nasty Goblins on a recent raid. The importance of the information known to him is crucial to complete the hunt, so a Hero was sent into the gobbos' camp to steal him back.\\n\\nYour servant dumps the hog-tied Bretonnian herb collector at your feet, along with some loot he managed to steal on his way out.	false

incidents_localised_description_wh_main_incident_grn_dung_pile_explosion	The one thing your kind loves as much as war is poo. You pile it high, building your huts or fashioning it into idols of Gork or Mork. Trouble is, that stuff gets hot when there's a large mound of it, creating a stinky gas which can explode… and has!	false
incidents_localised_description_wh_main_incident_grn_dwarf_expeditionary_throng	A small Dwarfen throng, or 'mob of stunty gitz', in your parlance is attacking a stronghold. They hope to reclaim it for the Karaz Ankor. Fools!	false

Occasionally, they forget their place and think to usurp the true masters of Undeath - the Vampires. This Necromancer thinks he is better than us…	false
incidents_localised_description_wh_main_incident_vmp_blood_dragons	Vampire Knights from the Blood Dragon order pass through our lands. Despite our entreatments, they will not fight for us - some foolish notion of honour prevents it. However, they have left us a gift - a blessing of Abhorash on our own cavalry.	false

incidents_localised_description_wh_main_incident_vmp_influence_of_nagash	Despite the Vampires' hatred of Nagash, his influence is inextricably linked to all creatures of Undeath.
