advice_levels_onscreen_text_2139667295	Good! The enemy will no doubt have picked up your movements. They will be frantically barricading their hovels in preparation for your arrival.	false

advice_levels_onscreen_text_2139669498	Be sure to advance with all your warriors at once, my lord! You risk becoming overwhelmed if you engage piecemeal.	false
advice_levels_onscreen_text_2139669502	The Elves of Athel Loren are a rare sight. These mysterious beings keep their own company and seldom emerge from their forests. Whilst they are not great in number, cross them at your peril.	false
advice_levels_onscreen_text_2139669506	The Druchii intend to give battle, Prince Tyrion. Send your Elven warriors in to attack! Show the enemy no mercy!	false
advice_levels_onscreen_text_2139669509	You, the Asrai of Athel Loren, live in harmony with the great forest you call home. Yet there are those abroad who would endanger this paradise. Wield the sublime fury of nature against your foes and protect this woodland against all that may threaten it.	false
advice_levels_onscreen_text_2139669516	The foolish rats dare to resist your advance, sire. Attack! Slaughter them, and take the pitiful survivors as slaves!	false
advice_levels_onscreen_text_2139669526	Your actions have not gone unnoticed, my lord. Dark forces are now massed all around us - they come to destroy the Oak of Ages! Protect it at all costs, for it is the essence of life within Athel Loren.	false
advice_levels_onscreen_text_2139669534	Ancient and mighty Durthu, you are roused from slumber. Athel Loren lies in ruin and is in need of your strength.	false
advice_levels_onscreen_text_2139669536	Be sure to keep watch on your warriors in battle, my lord! Their very lives may depend upon it!	false
advice_levels_onscreen_text_2139669537	The forest is afflicted with an unknown sickness, weakening all those who dwell beneath its canopies.	false
advice_levels_onscreen_text_2139669538	Haha! The enemy lose the will to fight! See how they run from the battle! Press your advantage!	false
advice_levels_onscreen_text_2139669541	Many great halls have fallen to darkness, and the once-mighty Oak of Ages is now a bleak shadow of its former glory.	false
advice_levels_onscreen_text_2139669542	See to the forest's wounds, and do what the Asrai cannot do themselves, keep the Deepwood safe!	false
advice_levels_onscreen_text_2139669546	Your forces have been defeated in detail, my lord. They run from the battle! Let us retreat and regroup!	false
advice_levels_onscreen_text_2139669548	The forest rejuvenates, thanks to you. Yet the source of the sickness remains unknown - who is responsible?	false
advice_levels_onscreen_text_2139669552	The Druchii re-enter the field, and in great numbers! Your Asur are brave but this shall be a stern test.	false
advice_levels_onscreen_text_2139669554	Perhaps the ignorant Bretonnian interlopers, or the verminous mountain Goblins? Whoever the culprit, we must march on their lands and seize them as penance. 	false
advice_levels_onscreen_text_2139669556	The Skaven send more forces to contest the battlefield, your majesty. The situation is grave; they advance in great numbers!	false
advice_levels_onscreen_text_2139669558	Beastmen have arrived to terrorise the forest! The Deepwood once more faces peril from these braying, snorting herds.	false
advice_levels_onscreen_text_2139669560	Look, Lord Mazdamundi! More Norse invaders advance against you. They come forward in great numbers!	false
advice_levels_onscreen_text_2139669562	They seem to march without a leader, but their dark desires unify them all the same.	false
advice_levels_onscreen_text_2139669565	The forest is with you, Durthu. The ever-increasing threat of the Beastmen must be defeated immediately!	false
advice_levels_onscreen_text_2139669566	Morghur! The vile, twisted Beastlord of corruption and mutation emerges from the shadows to rain his destruction upon Athel Loren. We cannot allow him to exact his desires upon us, Durthu!	false
advice_levels_onscreen_text_2139669568	The 'Elf-things' send more forces to contest the battle, Lord Queek! They pour forward in great numbers!	false
advice_levels_onscreen_text_2139669570	He makes for the Oak of Ages, with all his hordes at his back; we cannot allow him to exact his desires upon us, Durthu!	false
advice_levels_onscreen_text_2139669574	Move quickly to defend this ridge, my lord. The trees will grant your warriors cover, while the slope will provide them an advantage in combat.	false
advice_levels_onscreen_text_2139669579	Morghur is struck from this world, nothing more than a stain upon the battlefield! A great victory has been won this day.	false
advice_levels_onscreen_text_2139669580	Allied forces approach, Tyrion! See that some amongst their number carry bows; they will be able to rain arrows upon the Druchii from behind your front lines.	false
advice_levels_onscreen_text_2139669584	You should look now to remove the miasma of corruption that Morghur and his vile ways have left behind, and rejuvenate the Oak of Ages.	false
advice_levels_onscreen_text_2139669587	Allies come into view, sire! Press them into your service at once. Some amongst their number carry crossbows; they will be able to fire on the ratmen from behind your frontlines.	false
advice_levels_onscreen_text_2139669591	My lord! It is … it is Morghur! He is returned! I did not believe the Asrai tales to be any more than stories, but his spirit is indeed reborn to this world!	false
advice_levels_onscreen_text_2139669595	A party of Skinks, my lord! Press these allies into your service. Some amongst their number carry javelins to throw; these will prove most useful against the enemy.	false
advice_levels_onscreen_text_2139669596	His immortal soul is anchored to our world through foul magic beyond understanding. His defeat has slighted him, now he moves for the mountains intent on poisoning the water that flows from the Silver Spire.	false
advice_levels_onscreen_text_2139669600	Morghur's forces will not relent until you are defeated. You must keep them at bay whilst strengthening the Oak of Ages, for only the Oak's power can hope to break Morghur's hold on immortality. Hurry, there's not much time!	false
advice_levels_onscreen_text_2139669602	The reinforcements now fall under your control, my lord. Move the infantry into your frontline; the extra bodies are sorely needed.	false
advice_levels_onscreen_text_2139669605	You are imbued with the Oak's power now, Durthu, the forest is your strength. Such a power can destroy Morghur once and for all - go now, march to him, stop his plans. Destroy him forever!	false
advice_levels_onscreen_text_2139669609	Does rage still beat in your heart, Durthu? Even now, with Morghur consigned to oblivion and the world returned from the brink? Does war still drive your mind?	false
advice_levels_onscreen_text_2139669610	Be sure to arrange your infantry in a line for the coming battle, my lord. Each unit should cover the flank of the next. Do not let the enemy attack the sides of your formation, or break through to the rear!	false
advice_levels_onscreen_text_2139669613	Your dreams are disturbed by voices that speak of your failures, but mark this amongst your successes. There can be no greater victory.	false
advice_levels_onscreen_text_2139669614	Mounted reinforcements, my lord! Hurry them into battle, for they are sorely needed!	false
advice_levels_onscreen_text_2139669620	You were roused from slumber to achieve this; to defeat the evil that threatened the Deepwood. Perhaps now you can rest again?	false
advice_levels_onscreen_text_2139669623	Your sorrow is boundless and anger all-consuming. Sleep now in the forest's arms, ancient Durthu, let fitful and restless sleep torment you until you are woken again…	false
advice_levels_onscreen_text_2139669624	Hurry your troops, my lord! Those in the fight are beginning to tire!	false
advice_levels_onscreen_text_2139669627	Greetings Orion, King in the Woods - you awake to a world sorely in need of you. Athel Loren lies broken and in ruin.	false
advice_levels_onscreen_text_2139669633	A sickness lies upon the forest, sapping its strength.	false
advice_levels_onscreen_text_2139669634	The enemy waver, my lord, their troops begin to flee! Victory beckons!	false
advice_levels_onscreen_text_2139669640	Your warriors begin to flee, my lord! Their courage fails them!	false

advice_levels_onscreen_text_2139669644	Though you are born into fleeting life, Orion, through your strength the forest will heal. This is the time of rebirth - for Ariel, for Kurnous, and for Athel Loren!	false
advice_levels_onscreen_text_2139669645	The Druchii are driven from the field, my prince! The war to secure Ulthuan continues, but this day belongs to the Asur! Victory!	false
advice_levels_onscreen_text_2139669648	The Skaven abandon the field, as is typical of their cowardly race! I almost pity the wounded they leave behind. Victory is yours!	false
advice_levels_onscreen_text_2139669649	The courage of the Norse trespassers has failed them - they flee for their lives! Victory is yours, eternal lord!	false
advice_levels_onscreen_text_2139669653	The enemy flee the field, Warlord Queek! The Clanrats chitter your triumph. The head of the Elf-thing leader is yours to take. Victory!	false
advice_levels_onscreen_text_2139669654	Your halls are secure once more, Orion, but the larger question still remains; who is to blame for the damage done?	false
advice_levels_onscreen_text_2139669655	The last of your forces flee, my lord! This battle is lost; let us retreat and regroup!	false
advice_levels_onscreen_text_2139669657	Mayhap our neighbours, the Bretonnians? Or the ever-festering Orcs from the mountains? Whoever is responsible, we must push forth from the forests to seize their lands in retribution.	false
advice_levels_onscreen_text_2139669667	Riotous Beastmen have been spotted near our borders, my lord, doubtless intent on spreading their Chaotic brutality. They are surely responsible for defiling our halls; it is what they live for.	false
advice_levels_onscreen_text_2139669670	They appear now leaderless, but still single-mindedly bent on a vision of pure destruction.	false
advice_levels_onscreen_text_2139669671	Assign individual targets for each of your units when attacking, my lord. Keep a wide formation; do not let your forces be surrounded!	false
advice_levels_onscreen_text_2139669672	The threat they pose is ever-increasing. Do not underestimate them; they are the enemy of all civilisation. You must confront these ravenous beasts and put them to rout.	false
advice_levels_onscreen_text_2139669673	Morghur! The vile, twisted Beastlord of corruption and mutation emerges from the shadows to rain his destruction upon our realm. 	false
advice_levels_onscreen_text_2139669680	He makes for the Oak of Ages, with all his hordes at his back; we cannot allow him to exact his desires upon us, Orion!	false
advice_levels_onscreen_text_2139669681	Your Druchii soldiers are ready for battle, Malekith, my king. Each one of them yearns to spill the blood of the enemy in your name.	false
advice_levels_onscreen_text_2139669682	Morghur falls! Take heart, for the Asrai prevail against this tide of corruption. A great victory has been won this day.	false
advice_levels_onscreen_text_2139669685	Your fearsome cohorts line up ready for battle, revered lord. They await only your command to advance.	false
advice_levels_onscreen_text_2139669690	You should look now to remove the miasma of corruption that Morghur and his vile ways have left behind, and rejuvenate the Oak of Ages.	false
advice_levels_onscreen_text_2139669694	The Clanrats are ready for battle, mightiest of Warlords. Each one stands ready to fight, eager to gain your favour.	false
advice_levels_onscreen_text_2139669695	My lord! It is Morghur! He has returned! I did not believe the Asrai tales to be any more than stories, but his spirit is indeed reborn to this world!	false
advice_levels_onscreen_text_2139669705	His immortal soul is tethered to our plane through weird and heretical means. Slighted by defeat, he lusts now for ultimate revenge. Even now, he marches for the mountains, intent on poisoning the water that flows from the Silver Spire.	false
advice_levels_onscreen_text_2139669706	The time has come to advance your warriors, my lord. Select your whole army, so that the order may be given to all.	false
advice_levels_onscreen_text_2139669710	Morghur's forces will not relent until you are defeated. Push them back, Orion, and strengthen the Oak of Ages, for only the Oak's power can hope to break Morghur's hold on immortality. Hurry; there is not much time!	false
advice_levels_onscreen_text_2139669714	Good! Now, order your army forward, my lord. Let us crest this ridge and find where the enemy lies.	false
advice_levels_onscreen_text_2139669716	The power of the forest flows through you now, Orion - you have the strength to stop Morghur. Go now; his victory is within his reach. March on him, stop the carnage! Stop Morghur!	false
advice_levels_onscreen_text_2139669718	Excellent! Your place is amongst your warriors, mighty lord. Your very presence encourages them to fight harder.	false
advice_levels_onscreen_text_2139669723	Victory! Morghur is relegated to oblivion, Orion, along with his feculent ilk! 	false
advice_levels_onscreen_text_2139669725	You have held Athel Loren against the beastly hordes and averted absolute catastrophe from befalling the entire world.	false
advice_levels_onscreen_text_2139669733	Now, winter is approaching; we all feel the icy chill upon the air. The time has come for you to return to the Oak of Ages; Ariel is calling.	false
advice_levels_onscreen_text_2139669734	Advance upon the ridge without delay, my lord! That position offers you the best chance of victory against such a number. Order your forces forward, quickly!	false
advice_levels_onscreen_text_2139669738	Step into Athel Loren's leafy embrace and begin the cycle of renewal once again. This is one end, Orion, but every end is a new beginning…	false
advice_levels_onscreen_text_2139669741	Excellent, my lord! The ridge is yours. Move your infantry out to block the pass and await the enemy's arrival. Do not be tempted out of position!	false
advice_levels_onscreen_text_2139669756	Your presence on the field inspires the Elves you command, Prince Tyrion. Under your leadership, your warriors will advance with great confidence into battle. Wield your influence wisely!	false
advice_levels_onscreen_text_2139669757	Place your fresh missile troops behind your army. They will fire automatically if the enemy come into range.	false
advice_levels_onscreen_text_2139669761	Greetings to you, Morghur, eternal agent of change. You are reborn from Chaos once again that you may hasten the mutation of this world, and bring Ruin to its people.	false
advice_levels_onscreen_text_2139669770	Man has ever been the true enemy of the Beastmen, Morghur, and none more so than the hated Empire. Descend upon their lands and bring down a fury that will shake the foundations of the earth!	false
advice_levels_onscreen_text_2139669778	Yet there are others who would oppose you. The Wood Elves, hidden behind their sanctuary trees, have long stood in opposition to your goals. Twist their gnarled roots into unknowable agony; let them know defeat!	false
advice_levels_onscreen_text_2139669788	To the north, more men stand against you. They who call themselves 'Bretonnians' should be utterly crushed - their glittering spires and dreams of chivalry brought to nought but rubble!	false
advice_levels_onscreen_text_2139669790	You are Morghur, the Shadowgave, the Master of Skulls. Your time is now. Visit upon this world such horrors that generations yet unborn will scream in torment!	false
advice_levels_onscreen_text_2139669800	My lord! His immortal soul is tethered to our plane through weird and heretical means. Only the Oak's power can hope to break Morghur's hold on immortality. 	false
advice_levels_onscreen_text_2139669804	Be ever vigilant, my eternal lord. I come to render my assistance to the forest, for this is a time of great peril for Athel Loren; potential enemies are at every turn.	false
advice_levels_onscreen_text_2139669812	To the north, the Bretonnians lie in wait. We must tread carefully, for their expansionist desires are well known, yet they could be firm allies against other foes.	false
advice_levels_onscreen_text_2139669819	Furthermore, Greenskin incursions are increasing - they defile the sanctity of the forests with their filth. The only answer is war – move against their mountain hovels and end their sorry sorties.	false
advice_levels_onscreen_text_2139669827	To the west, the Beastmen herds are massing. These cloven beasts will desecrate everything, including your sacred woodlands, unless stopped by force of arms. You must turn the tables, take the hunt to them – the taint of Chaos must not despoil the King's Glade!	false
advice_levels_onscreen_text_2139669834	Though the men of the lowlands know the price of intrusion, they still trespass upon your hallowed groves. No more. Drive them from the forest's edge!	false
advice_levels_onscreen_text_2139669835	The Oak of Ages is threatened, Lord Orion, and it is time to unite in their defence. The Asrai of Athel Loren shall be ascendant – to war!	false

advice_levels_onscreen_text_2139669864	Age has made you twisted and furious, Father of the Forest, but this rage makes you mighty. Go now – smite the unworthy! Defend Athel Loren!	false
advice_levels_onscreen_text_2139669868	The Oak of Ages stands strong in the face of adversity.	false
advice_levels_onscreen_text_2139669878	You have the strength to stop Morghur.	false
advice_levels_onscreen_text_2139669879	Battle has been joined, my lord. Order your forces forward to envelop the enemy where possible. Do not leave troops idle!	false
advice_levels_onscreen_text_2139669880	Let the Horn of Kurnous blast one last time in triumph, and rid the world of these foul creatures forever!	false
advice_levels_onscreen_text_2139669887	I humbly beg of your attention, Prince Tyrion. I come with blessings from the Loremasters of Saphery. Though I am but a short-lived man, my advice may be of use in this black hour.	false
advice_levels_onscreen_text_2139669891	Protect the Oak of Ages, my lord! Should it fall, the sacred forest will surely wilt away with it!	false
advice_levels_onscreen_text_2139669892	The Dark Elves, or Druchii as they are called by your kind, have yoked the malevolent energies unleashed by the comet's appearance. With them, they have found a route through the Shifting Isles to the southern shores of your homeland, Ulthuan.	false
advice_levels_onscreen_text_2139669894	I regret to inform that in your absence their dreaded forces have run rampant across Ulthuan. While your capital, Lothern, remains uncompromised, several smaller cities have fallen.	false
advice_levels_onscreen_text_2139669897	The Oak of Ages stands strong in the face of adversity. Make sure it remains so, my lord.	false
advice_levels_onscreen_text_2139669899	The city-port of Lothern, your capital, is the seat of the Phoenix King. A garrison defends the city but it is gravely threatened.	false
advice_levels_onscreen_text_2139669901	Druchii raiders sack the surrounding countryside, probing the city's defences. The Phoenix Throne cannot be allowed to fall; the Dark Elves must be engaged and driven from Ulthuan!	false
advice_levels_onscreen_text_2139669904	Lightning strikes by the enemy have gained them control of the Tower of Lysean, Lord Tyrion. Its capture means they now command the straits of Lothern at both ends.	false
advice_levels_onscreen_text_2139669912	Furthermore, scouts report that the Dark Elves have struck at Angerrial and overrun the defences there. Digging them out of this fortified city will not be easy, my prince. The Druchii must not be left to despoil the inner kingdoms of Ulthuan!	false
advice_levels_onscreen_text_2139669913	Hail to you, o cold and beautiful Isabella! Mannfred dwells in Castle Drakenhof, your rightful home! So whilst you should be rightfully proud of what you have achieved so far, there is clearly still much to be done.	false
advice_levels_onscreen_text_2139669917	Your host enters the theatre of war, Prince Tyrion. Wield your forces wisely; they are your best hope for averting Lothern's destruction.	false
advice_levels_onscreen_text_2139669923	The Templehof brood control the lands to the north, as far as the River Stir. They cannot be suffered to endure, lest they threaten your strength. Raise your forces, march on the foe, and show them true terror!	false
advice_levels_onscreen_text_2139669926	Prince Tyrion, now is the perfect time to attack. Select your army first.	false
advice_levels_onscreen_text_2139669932	The high mountains to the south are infested with Dwarfs. Our lands will never be safe with such an enemy so close. Make plans to drive out their stunted kind in time.	false
advice_levels_onscreen_text_2139669938	You are the power behind the mightiest of the von Carstein bloodline. Cruel and wicked mistress – the world shudders at what ruin you might make.	false
advice_levels_onscreen_text_2139669939	Battle is upon you, Prince Tyrion! Have your host sharpen their swords, fasten their armour, and prepare for bloodshed!	false
advice_levels_onscreen_text_2139669941	The Phoenix King sends his congratulations, Prince Tyrion, for the Druchii invaders have been driven from the field! The fate of those taken captive from the battle is yours to decide.	false
advice_levels_onscreen_text_2139669943	So set forth, Isabella, wife and warrior, beauty, and horror. The fury in your eyes will bring this world to its knees!	false
advice_levels_onscreen_text_2139669951	Your forces are weary from battle, yet they still retain some strength to march on. See for yourself.	false
advice_levels_onscreen_text_2139669952	The distance your army can still move is shown around it, my lord. Plan your movements wisely, for your armies cannot defend the realm if they are not present to fight.	false
advice_levels_onscreen_text_2139669959	The enemy still threaten your capital, Prince Tyrion. Move now to block the route from the south and close off the possibility of attack.	false
advice_levels_onscreen_text_2139669967	War has brought us to these unforgiving wastes, where the Ruinous Powers lie in wait to ensnare us. But Bretonnian Knights are formidable warriors and driven by the most noble of purposes! The kingdom is relying on you, my lord, you must drive the filth back into the mire!	false
advice_levels_onscreen_text_2139669968	The Badlands teem with Greenskins, my lord; this truly is the belly of the beast! Orcs and Goblins move to trap your forces. You must endure the green tide, fight hard to overcome it, and smite this evil, in the Lady’s blessed name!	false
advice_levels_onscreen_text_2139669969	Good! Your army now blocks the approach to your capital. Any attack by the enemy will need to get by you first. See for yourself how your forces control the area around them.	false
advice_levels_onscreen_text_2139669973	A blessing has been bestowed upon these men. The Lady will protect them for their heroism.	false
advice_levels_onscreen_text_2139669976	More Asur stand ready to take up arms in the name of the Phoenix King. Recruit them now, and they will be ready to fight in the battles to come.	false
advice_levels_onscreen_text_2139669979	Excellent choices, my lord. Be aware that the recruits will take time to train, and that your army must remain stationary while they do so.	false
advice_levels_onscreen_text_2139669981	The Lady blesses these men and grants them protection for their actions.	false
advice_levels_onscreen_text_2139669982	Let us review what destruction the Druchii have wrought on your territory, my prince. Select Lothern to inspect your province.	false
advice_levels_onscreen_text_2139669985	Here we may see the state of the province that surrounds your capital. The enemy raids have caused considerable unrest; public order is suffering as you can see, my lord. The agitators will need calming in time, but matters of defence are more pressing.	false
advice_levels_onscreen_text_2139669987	Cities within the local province are shown here, my lord, along with any facilities they contain.	false
advice_levels_onscreen_text_2139669989	These men will resist the enemies of Bretonnia, with the Lady now protecting them.	false
advice_levels_onscreen_text_2139669991	Your capital, and the buildings it contains are shown here, my lord. Work needs to be done to improve its readiness for war.	false
advice_levels_onscreen_text_2139669994	The Lady no longer favours these men, for they retreat from battle.	false
advice_levels_onscreen_text_2139670001	Your cities are the backbone of your state, my lord. Taxes are raised through them, and they provide the infrastructure necessary to support your armies. I humbly suggest you commission upgrades to your capital as soon as possible.	false
advice_levels_onscreen_text_2139670003	A display of noble action and good intent, my lord. Good things will come to those that possess these virtues.	false
advice_levels_onscreen_text_2139670004	Good! Construction will begin immediately, but will take some time to complete.	false
advice_levels_onscreen_text_2139670005	Seek ways to further even the vast knowledge of the Druchii, sire. Put the finest minds to work on improving your methods of war.	false
advice_levels_onscreen_text_2139670008	Good! In time, the knowledge they gain will surely aide your cause.	false
advice_levels_onscreen_text_2139670010	These are troubled times indeed when such unchivalrous actions are deemed just. Let us turn a blind eye to them for now.	false
advice_levels_onscreen_text_2139670012	Your current actions are quite unchivalrous, my lord. You do not display the virtues you once did.	false

advice_levels_onscreen_text_2139670036	Many unscrupulous actions have taken you down a dark and unchivalrous path, my lord. You will no doubt  feel the Lady's wrath for this.	false

advice_levels_onscreen_text_2139670062	Advance against the foolish Elves, Lord Queek! Let them learn why you are called 'Headtaker'!	false
advice_levels_onscreen_text_2139670063	Our lands prosper under your chivalrous rule, yet evil still breeds in every corner. Many look to destroy Bretonnia, and their power grows as quickly as our own. Stave off their advances and unite the banners of Bretonnia through your chivalric actions!	false
advice_levels_onscreen_text_2139670065	Allied Skaven, my lord! Conscript them into your service at once. Some amongst them bear slings and missiles; such weapons will be of great use against the foe.	false
advice_levels_onscreen_text_2139670072	Bretonnia stands strong as the protector of honour and chivalry. Yet one last challenge must still be met, in the wastes of the Old World. Our king prepares for battle on the grandest of scales and calls forth an Errantry War. I ask you now to bestow your great virtues upon us and lead the Knightly Orders to their final victory over our enemy!	false
advice_levels_onscreen_text_2139670081	Bretonnia flowers in true splendour – tales shall be told of your chivalric deeds for years to come! As our borders expand so our code of chivalry spreads with it. Do not relent, for Bretonnia will be the beacon of light in this ever crumbling world.	false

advice_levels_onscreen_text_2139670109	Alas the Green Knight fades with the mist as quickly as he emerged. Perhaps he will appear again when the need is great?	false
advice_levels_onscreen_text_2139670114	The peasants of Bretonnia are the workforce of our farms and mills. Enlisting too many to bolster your forces will come at a cost to your farming income.	false
advice_levels_onscreen_text_2139670115	Our fields and orchards are short of workers and with it our income dwindles. See that manpower is improved to reap the benefits of the land.	false
advice_levels_onscreen_text_2139670116	Good! Your troops are now hidden from enemy sight, as you can see.	false
advice_levels_onscreen_text_2139670118	Pay attention to your unit cards, my lord, for they indicate the status of your troops. Be mindful of your army; success on the battlefield depends upon it.	false
advice_levels_onscreen_text_2139670119	This ridge will afford your troops an edge in the coming battle, my lord. Place the rest of your troops close by and claim its forward slopes once battle begins.	false
advice_levels_onscreen_text_2139670125	Workers return to the fields. Crops now grow with abundance and our coffers are full with gold once more.	false

advice_levels_onscreen_text_2139670130	To arms, then! The enemy enter the field. Advance and claim the hilltop, my lord. Its slopes will serve your forces well. Keep your cavalry hidden!	false
advice_levels_onscreen_text_2139670132	Hail, Alberic, Duke of Bordeleaux! The salty sea air is a bracing reprieve from the cloying, inland darkness that now threatens the coast.	false
advice_levels_onscreen_text_2139670139	Directly North, the damned city of Mousillon spits out dark forces that you must deal with. Bretonnia may ignore this blight, but you cannot. 	false
advice_levels_onscreen_text_2139670144	King Leoncoeur resides at Couronne, but is beset by the Greenskin threat from the nearby mountains. You are expected to aid the crown, but ultimately it is your choice alone.	false
advice_levels_onscreen_text_2139670153	The merchant princes of Marienburg have no love for Bretonnia, they are more concerned with the accumulation of wealth. Gluttons, yes, but perhaps useful…	false
advice_levels_onscreen_text_2139670156	The mountains teem with Greenskins and Dwarfs, constantly warring with one another. Should they descend from their peaks into Bretonnia, conflict will surely follow.	false
advice_levels_onscreen_text_2139670166	A storm is brewing above Bretonnia, my lord, with a ferocity that Bordeleaux cannot avoid. You may not be king, Alberic, but Manann watches over you. Use his thalassic strength to defend Bordeleaux and wash your enemies away!	false
advice_levels_onscreen_text_2139670174	Blessings on you and your lands, wise and Fay Enchantress. Your kingdom is in peril and has need of your strength – dark clouds are brewing abroad.	false
advice_levels_onscreen_text_2139670184	The Elves of Athel Loren grow bold of late. Their expansionist desires see them encroaching beyond the limits of the forest. Hold your own against their ilk.	false
advice_levels_onscreen_text_2139670186	The nearby mountains are infested with Greenskins – as ever they battle the stubborn Dwarfs. Be vigilant, lest their filthy scourge infects Bretonnian lands…	false
advice_levels_onscreen_text_2139670191	Along the coast, the mercenaries of Tilea sell their swords to the highest bidder. You can be sure they value coin over loyalty. Be wary of them.	false
advice_levels_onscreen_text_2139670199	The savage Beastlord, Khazrak, dwells nearby. He is set upon a path of war that will invariably bring him into contact with you. You must defeat this Ruinous threat!	false
advice_levels_onscreen_text_2139670202	Ever-blessed by the Lady of the Lake, Bretonnian lands serve the goddess completely. Show no fear; march forth and in her name restore the virtue of your realm!	false
advice_levels_onscreen_text_2139670211	Greetings to you, benevolent royarch. Blessed is your rule over Bretonnia, yet darkness spreads from abroad and threatens your kingdom. The threat is real; it must be faced.	false
advice_levels_onscreen_text_2139670216	To the east, the greedy merchant princes of Marienburg conspire to consolidate their riches. Observe that much wealth flows into Marienburg, but very little emerges.	false
advice_levels_onscreen_text_2139670226	Further South, in the Grey Mountains, Greenskins and Dwarfs vie for control of the peaks. Whoever wins may yet cause trouble for you, my lord…	false
advice_levels_onscreen_text_2139670235	Beyond, the Wood Elves in their mysterious forest protect their homes. Whilst at the coast, the Duke of Bordeleaux is as unpredictable as the roiling sea and as secretive as the watery depths.	false
advice_levels_onscreen_text_2139670240	Elsewhere, the Unliving lords of Mousillon wage war against mortal men. The bickering dukedoms ignore the looming threat, and so it falls to you to act, my liege.	false
advice_levels_onscreen_text_2139670243	Only a united Bretonnia can face these growing perils. Raise your banner, King Leoncoeur, and drive this evil from the world in the Lady's blessed name!	false
advice_levels_onscreen_text_2142105739	Finally, you have found the dwelling of the colossus known as Blorgar the Mad Titan, my lord! 	false

advice_levels_onscreen_text_2146375571	Here is your first prey, a mortal army wishing to catch the gaze of the Blood God. Instead they draw your attention!	false
advice_levels_onscreen_text_2146401758	You have travelled far, Oxyotl, but you are no stranger to great and perilous journeys. The Norscan tribe you have been pursuing has managed to push past the Dark Elf towers and threatens to move further south.	false
advice_levels_onscreen_text_2146752275	Flying beasts! Of course the forces of Chaos do not fight fair. Order your warriors to bring them down, brother!	false
advice_levels_onscreen_text_217009818	A puzzle of the Old Ones, ancient beings the reptiles still claim to serve. Solving this will bestow many great riches upon you. Perhaps the answer has something to do with the rotation of these curious dice? 	false
advice_levels_onscreen_text_217161212	Yet other clans have done the same. Though together you may do great work, they are not to be trusted. Only Clan Pestilens should prosper here – do what you must to survive.	false
advice_levels_onscreen_text_219220603	Wulfrik, you are the Eternal Challenger and your Gods have blessed you with the Gift of Tongues. Embody their cold ruthless nature and set sail aboard Seafang for wrath and Ruin!	false
advice_levels_onscreen_text_219432942	Runes of Chaos. Kurnz branded them with dark prayers.	false
advice_levels_onscreen_text_21981236	Your warriors rampage, mighty lord! They no longer respond to orders!	false
advice_levels_onscreen_text_220410835	You count amongst your Asur kin some of the finest minds in all creation. Put them to work on improving your methods of warfare, my lord. For this task they will need even grander edifices.	false
advice_levels_onscreen_text_220524798	My lord, there are still many Scrolls of Hekarti remaining to be found throughout these lands. Gather more and strengthen our cause.	false

advice_levels_onscreen_text_22629515	I swear to seek the Grail. May the Lady grant me the strength!	false
advice_levels_onscreen_text_228338098	Perhaps the Estalians could be your first test subjects? They may well be harbouring a wealth of Warpstone, and will surely offer little resistance to a carefully-aimed Doomrocket.	false
advice_levels_onscreen_text_229090424	Allegiance, my lord! The scales of the Serpent crush with the power of violent seas – all shall fear what slithers from the depths of Norsca!	false
advice_levels_onscreen_text_229611827	Reptile-things should not be here! Why have they resettled old-festering ruins? What are they up to, mmm? Attack soon - claim this place for Clan Pestilens!	false
advice_levels_onscreen_text_230235706	The threat of Clan Eshin cannot be allowed to follow us back to Naggaroth. We must deal with them at once.	false
advice_levels_onscreen_text_231042798	You approach the Brass Citadel to face the Blood God's favoured Daemon Prince. But battle awaits you there, for this is Khorne's palace. Survive against waves of His thirstiest Daemons and slay the Gatekeeper – only then can its soul be captured.	false
advice_levels_onscreen_text_231926725	For the Wanderer roams Lustria once more. The spirit of the jungle made manifest. A reckoning has come.	false
advice_levels_onscreen_text_232289841	None shall stand between hunter and prey!	false
advice_levels_onscreen_text_23327334	The colonists yearn not just to survive, but to thrive. To give them a solid foundation, this entire territory must be made defensible. In time, the beasts will learn not to cross our borders. 	false

advice_levels_onscreen_text_236097860	Co-operation is a benefit of any martial alliance. Send word to your allies, and you may co-ordinate strikes against your common enemies.	false
advice_levels_onscreen_text_237385338	The cannons rain death. They must be destroyed!	false
advice_levels_onscreen_text_237420318	There is dark, ancient power to be found in the south. Though you may think twice before meddling here, it may be necessary, for in the distant ocean a formidable Black Ark of the Druchii has been spotted, its business unknown.	false
advice_levels_onscreen_text_239287583	My lord, you have enough offerings to make a sacrifice to Sotek. May his blessings bring you the greatest of rewards.	false
advice_levels_onscreen_text_239911511	An attack on Ghrond should not be undertaken lightly, but is surely necessary to secure its power for your cause.	false

advice_levels_onscreen_text_242843113	To the south are the lands of the Lizardmen littered with cities built in honour of their gods, sworn enemies of the Ruinous Masters. Trample them to dust, raise Herdstones, and make Blood-grounds to sate your savage desires.	false
advice_levels_onscreen_text_243249577	The Black Tower shall become the new centre of influence!	false
advice_levels_onscreen_text_244590687	Your kind have often had cause to discipline the Skeggi raiders that dwell on the edge of the jungle, but never have they marched against you in such numbers. It would seem that Sotek’s comet has incited the lesser races into acts of madness!	false
advice_levels_onscreen_text_244700737	We sanctify these grounds. 	false
advice_levels_onscreen_text_244882158	Few relics are left, for Dark Magic once took hold of this place. Furthermore, the Dwarfs have committed sacrilege in seeking the Dragons’ treasures, wantonly despoiling their remains.	false
advice_levels_onscreen_text_245172381	I love the murk, but this time I require clarity… infected you'll be, if you do not allow me to see!	false
advice_levels_onscreen_text_245177013	And across the Sea of Claws lies even fatter prey. The Empire is within reach. But beyond that fractured nation… the so-called Motherland. Kislev. The nation which abandoned you, whose god you had no choice but to slay…  	false

advice_levels_onscreen_text_251160832	Glorious acts that honour the various Gods of Chaos will surely gain their favour. Seek ways to exalt the Ruinous Powers, for through their blessings may great prizes be gained.	false
advice_levels_onscreen_text_251327290	How disappointing. The crone sends her puppets to find lore she is unable to learn - her twisted soul could never attain such knowledge naturally. We must stop them obtaining the Scrolls of Hekarti.	false
advice_levels_onscreen_text_253695909	What hides in this Daemon lair?	false
advice_levels_onscreen_text_253789698	At the desert's edge lies the magnificent Charnel Valley, mighty tombs and the resting place of kings from ancient dynasties. The wealth within attracts many still-breathing raiders.	false
