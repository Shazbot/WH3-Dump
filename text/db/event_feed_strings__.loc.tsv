event_feed_strings_text_wh2_dlc09_event_feed_string_scripted_event_black_pyramid_flying_secondary_detail	The Black Pyramid, Nagash's greatest legacy, is a construction of pure, malevolent power, and now almost unbelievably it is floating above the desert. The power of the books of Nagash, now gathered and harnessed, has streamed into the pyramid, detaching it from its foundations and lifting it up from the sand dunes below. Surely it is clear for all to see that this is the grand design of the fabled Necromancer who’s name this massive structure bears, and perhaps through unparalleled foresight or through coincidence alone the power emanating from every crevice and block of stone acts as a beacon to all across Nehekhara. Undoubtedly any king or queen with the ability to affect the outcome of this plight will muster their forces and head towards this monument suspended in the sky… only time will tell if this is indeed Nagash’s will manifesting itself.	false

event_feed_strings_text_wh2_dlc11_event_feed_string_scripted_pirate_ship_secondary_detail_1	Houghhoff was a renowned admiral in the imperial navy and his tale is one of bewilderment. The story tells that he kept a bright yellow parrot as a pet that sat upon his shoulder, never leaving his master’s side for a moment. Houghhoff, famous for having never lost a battle at sea, somewhat oddly put the credit for every victory solely with the parrot! Supposedly, during the heat of battle, the parrot squawked key tactical advice, which the admiral would use to soundly beat his opponents.\\n\\nWhether Houghhoff’s parrot was simply uttering madness-induced ramblings or not, his crew could not deny the Reik-Admiral’s resultant mastery of naval combat. So, when one morning Houghhoff exited his cabin and announced to his crew that they were to leave the service of the Empire immediately and become pirates – upon the suggestion of the parrot – everyone aboard simply... agreed.	false
event_feed_strings_text_wh2_dlc11_event_feed_string_scripted_pirate_ship_secondary_detail_2	As a High Elf prince, Fhiron Wavemaker had lived a life of luxury, but – as is the case with many who want for nothing, materially-speaking – eventually began to feel empty and yearned for something more. One afternoon, along the coast of Saphery, he set sail into the mist of the Sea of Dreams in a small sailing boat with no other soul aboard. Upon returning many hours later, Fhiron rushed to the harbour of Port Elistor and had a large vessel commissioned – a weapon of war he would name Wavebreaker.\\n\\nMany months later, with the mighty warship Wavebreaker completed, Prince Fhiron set sail through the Straits of Lothern with a crew made up of the most loyal from his court. Nobody knows exactly what caused him to give up everything and choose a life at sea, but whatever happened that one fateful afternoon in the mist is undoubtedly where it all began…	false
event_feed_strings_text_wh2_dlc11_event_feed_string_scripted_pirate_ship_secondary_detail_3	A once-famous vintner from Bretonnia, Heastie was aboard his trade ship en route to deliver goods to the New World. Near to reaching their destination the ship was beset by an Undead vessel commanded by the legendary pirate Rozov von Drak. As the Unliving stormed Heastie’s ship, sparing not one of his crew, he made his last stand at the helm. Surrounded, and with swords to his throat, his enemy made an offer: join him as a Vampire in Undeath and serve as his first mate. Heastie, without much choice, all things considered, accepted Drak’s offer and so came to serve the Vampire for many years aboard his ship, learning not only the ways of piracy, but also those of Dark Magic.\\n\\nHeastie always harboured his own grand plans for greatness, however. One night, as he stood with von Drak at the helm, Heastie drew his blade and lopped off his master’s head. He stood there as the Skeleton crew crumbled to piles of bones, before raising the lifeless husks once more to serve him. Now as captain of the ship, and with a crew of Undead, he began a reign of terror all his own!	false

Captain Saltspite unleashed a rare laugh as the Swordfysh effortlessly glided through the waves. She was more than a mere pirate now, but a governess of many ports and richer than most Tilean princes. Maybe she should have shunned the living long ago?\\n\\nIt’s true that at first she had abhorred the Vampires and their zombie thralls on her ship, and only tolerated it due to the Seafather’s commandment. Yet, as they had slowly replaced the living and brought her victory after victory, Saltspite grew less concerned. Now she struggled to remember when she had last spoken to someone with breath and not seawater in their lungs.\\n\\nWho needs friends when you have power? That is what her uncle had told her anyway… for, of late, Manann spoke to her less and less. But there was another who filled that void; this one spoke of storms and sharks, and glorified her as the ultimate predator.

Yet now their precious Vortex quivers, Ulthuan shall sink and she will sing to the Phoenix King as he chokes on seawater!\\n\\nBathing in the adoration of her mindless, groaning crew, she was temporarily oblivious when a visitor appeared upon the deck of the Lamprey. It was a thing of rags, incorporeal and long-dead.\\n\\n"Enchantress," it whispered in greeting with an unearthly hiss. Cylostra flexed her flabellum to hide her face.\\n\\n"Who addresses Madame-Captain Direfin?" she asked in her most self-important voice. \\n\\n"I come at the behest of my master," said the ghostly emissary. "He asks if you desire a return to Bretonnia? Where he has been working against the living for some time and could use a spirit of such prodigious talent."\\n\\nThe Madame-Captain inspected her silvery form in the mirror as she considered a response.\\n\\n"A patron," she mused. "And who is it that shows such interest in moi?"\\n\\n"Like you, mistress, he is an Enchanter, and a great one no less. He has gone under many names over the centuries. At this time, he is only known as 'The Nameless'."	false
event_feed_strings_text_wh2_event_feed_string_scripted_event_epilogue_secondary_detail_cst_harkon	It was done. The Merwyrm was slain by the empowered Star-metal Harpoon; a testament to the monster-killing lineage of the Wulfharts. Now the beast was resurrected and in thrall to Harkon, the Vampire Coast would expand and Luthor would be a force in the wider world once more.\\n\\nThis was no mere idle boast, for his mind had finally begun to align - the choir in his head would still bicker and rage on occasion, but were held in awe to a new voice, one that spoke with the wisdom of eons, as if it was older than Harkon even. It promised to guide Luthor and bring about an Undead empires to dwarf the current pretenders, especially the petty vassal-fiefdom of the von Carsteins. And when all that was achieved, the voice swore Harkon would be worthy of the greatest prize - to be at the right hand of a new Death-God… to be a Mortarch. \\n\\nLuthor Harkon will not be on the periphery when the End Times come!	false

If he were still living, he may have taken a deep breath, but those days of heartbeats and warm blood were long gone. Nevertheless, still cursed with a mortal’s desires, Noctilus could not hide his pleasure. Amanar was his; a gargantuan corpse enthused with Necromantic energy to wield against his foes.\\n\\nHe would continue to expand his network of coves and burgeoning empire outwards from the Galleon’s Graveyard, for there was still much power to be sought. Let the other fools battle for the Vortex, he would feed the skull-strewn Maelstrom with soul-power, and when it was ready, he would sail the Bloody Reaver into it. Then the Count could ply the seas of time, go anywhere or any-when; it was the ancestors of Jaego Roth who had the most to fear, for he would hunt them all down. History itself will not be safe from Nyklaus von Carstein!	false
event_feed_strings_text_wh2_event_feed_string_scripted_event_epilogue_secondary_detail_def	The Witch King looked upon the bowed form of the assassin. Behind them, Malekith's Vortex roiled.\\n\\n"Why do you linger, Shadowblade? I thought Hellebron had summoned you back to Har Ganeth. My spies tell me she is not amused by your recent exploits." The Assassin said nothing but remained head down in submission. Malekith flexed his fingers as wisps of Vortex energy played up and down his armoured form. Although it was impossible to see his face behind the golden death mask, the Witch King was clearly amused.\\n\\n"It's this you want, isn't it?" He produced Felicion's soul-casket, dangling it before Shadowblade in a taunting gesture.\\n\\n"Yes."\\n\\n"Very well." He tossed the soul-casket and Shadowblade plucked it from the air. He bowed and turned in one swift motion, but stopped when he heard the Witch King speak once more.\\n\\n"A boon, Shadowblade, for your sister served me well. But if you must resurrect her, know that I will not entertain petty plots of revenge against me." The assassin gave a curt nod and strode away. "My mother on the other hand…," said the Witch King to the rapidly disappearing Assassin. He didn't raise his voice; he didn't have to. "She always needs to be kept in check."	false
event_feed_strings_text_wh2_event_feed_string_scripted_event_epilogue_secondary_detail_hef	Teclis walked the icy path and came upon what he sought - a half-frozen, half-eaten corpse.\\n\\n"I've found her," he said. From behind him Tyrion strode; at first the prince looked longingly towards the Shrine of Khaine, and then quickly refocused on what his brother was scrutinising - the body of Galifreius... or was it?\\n\\n"You are right, that is not my squire. When did you suspect?"\\n\\n"It doesn't matter. But that's why the rat-swarm attacked her over Talarian. How typical of Skaven. They could smell the treachery," said Teclis.\\n\\n"And what of my real squire? What became of her?"\\n\\n"I'd postulate she was ambushed en route to meeting Talarian for the very first time."\\n\\n"All this while we were taking advice from Malekith's puppet, and you knew!" raged Tyrion.\\n\\n"I suspect she was Morathi's thrall actually," mused Teclis, ignoring his brother's anger. "And not ‘knew' but suspected."\\n\\n"So what now, brother? I want vengeance for this outrage, and with the Vortex stabilised we have the breathing space to take it!"\\n\\nTeclis glanced around at the harsh terrain. Even he felt the pull of Khaine - of rage and vengeance - for the God of Murder's shrine was uncomfortably close. He looked southwards.\\n\\n"I will continue my labours in Lustria, there is still much to learn there," said the High Loremaster. Tyrion gave his brother a sour look.\\n\\n"After all we've been through? When will you deign to return to Ulthuan?"\\n\\n"In time," said Teclis, "In time."	false

Lower-caste Skink attendants fanned the Slann with great fronds.\\n\\n"Revered master, we have returned!" said Yukannadoozat enthusiastically. Tar-gax growled. The Slann did not stir.\\n\\nEven so, the Skink and Kroxigor approached their sleeping master with the appropriate respect.\\n\\n"Lord Mazdamundi sends his..."\\n\\nThe Mage-Priest's eyes snapped open. Its hypnotic stare bored into Yuk's own eyes and a deep, endless hum flooded the chamber.\\n\\n"The world is in peril," spoke the Slann, the words appearing directly in Yuk's head above the endless hum.\\n\\n"Forgive me, master. But your timeline is not synched. We have just averted disaster – the Great Vortex is now in our possession."\\n\\n"NO!" boomed the voice in the Skink's head. "A greater threat to this world arises. What has just occurred is but a small meal compared to the feast the Ancient Enemy has in store for us. N'Kari comes and we must be ready."	false
event_feed_strings_text_wh2_event_feed_string_scripted_event_epilogue_secondary_detail_skv	Sneek Scratchett bit his tail until blood flowed between his teeth. It was his way of releasing the built up stress and nervous energy. He was under tremendous pressure, having risen from lowly scribe to herald of a living God. It was the highest status any mortal Skaven could possibly achieve and therefore he was the most hated. He'd already been the target of several assassination attempts.\\n\\nSneek entered his grand burrow. It was richly adorned - another status symbol, another reason all other Skaven envied and hated him. He stopped abruptly when he saw a great mirror stood against the roughly-burrowed wall. Sneek sniffed suspiciously at it. His bloody tail wafted to-and-fro in nervousness. Was this a gift? From one of the clans, to buy his favour?\\n\\nHe scuttled up to the mirror and checked behind it to make sure the void wasn't concealing an assassin. It wasn't. He looked again at the surface of the mirror, its green sheen revealing that it was made of polished Warpstone.\\n\\nThen there was a hiss. Sneek's whiskers went straight in alarm.\\n\\n"Litter-thing...," said the Screaming One from the mirror. The face of the Verminlord coalesced within it. "How quickly you-you have risen, little scribe," it said. "I see you have found my mirror. I'm glad my servants could deliver it-it." Sneek gulped. "You have enjoyed great riches thanks to the-the path I put you on. The secrets of those rituals I gave... there was always going to be a cost. Now we must talk about my price, yes-yes?"\\n\\nThe herald meekly nodded, grabbed his tail, and bit down hard...	false
event_feed_strings_text_wh2_event_feed_string_scripted_event_epilogue_secondary_detail_tmb	The Liche Priest wandered through the vaunted corridors of the pyramid - obsidian walls sparking with power over hieroglyphics even older than the desert gods. Priest Nerutep was en route to the inner sanctum where his charge waited, but he lingered.\\n\\nArcane energy rippled down the walls and across the passage to form a barrier, but the Liche stepped through easily enough, giving a rasping hiss. It was trying to laugh.\\n\\n“You don’t want me here do you?” whispered Nerutep to the pyramid. “Of course you don’t – a creation of Nagash, you know who I really am.”\\n\\nA fierce wind blew along the corridor, but the Liche Priest walked on. “You can’t get rid of me that easily. You are linked to your creator are you not? Good. Tell Nagash – wherever he is – tell him Thutep walks within his sanctum. Yes, that will rile him. The lost King of Khemri influences the Black Pyramid now.”\\n\\nA call came from down the corridor. His charge was getting impatient.\\n\\n“Coming, sire,” said the Liche Priest - the second-born son and brother to Nagash strode more swiftly along the passageway.	false
event_feed_strings_text_wh2_event_feed_string_scripted_event_epilogue_secondary_detail_tmb_arkhan	Arkhan uttered dark words - an incantation to pierce the mortal veil and reach out to his master. He was within the sanctum of Nagash, at the heart of the Black Pyramid. It hung in the sky, defying the gods and now the Liche King would use its power to resurrect his master, like any good servant.\\n\\n“Ustab-Djaf, ey Shyish…,” spoke Arkhan in ancient Nehekharan before switching to the common tongue. “I command the God of Death to unfetter his most prominent prisoner; by Shyish, I invoke N–”\\n\\n“Nagash?” said the voice of a Daemon. “No, my little Mortarch, our names are similar, but he is elsewhere. I am N'Kari, and you are playing my game,” it said with a voice both beautiful and horrific.\\n\\n“What!” demanded Arkhan, scanning the sanctum for the source of the voice.\\n\\n“Calm yourself, Liche,” it said, amused. “I care not for your schemes. Play your game, build your petty empire, but know that I am now in your world, and will soon be ready to play…”\\n\\nA cold wind blew out of the chamber leaving a sickly-sweet scent in its wake.	false

event_feed_strings_text_wh2_event_feed_string_scripted_event_final_ritual_fails_secondary_detail_def	For all their ruthless cruelty, the Dreadlords of Naggarond have met with failure. At the time of the Sundering, when the Dark Elves split from their High Elf brethren, the Witch king vented his rage in an insane attempt to destroy the Great Vortex. The magical backlash shattered Ulthuan, and the schism between the two houses became irreversible. Now once again, the Dark Elves’ plans for the Great Vortex have come to nothing, and their power to influence it is no more.	false
event_feed_strings_text_wh2_event_feed_string_scripted_event_final_ritual_fails_secondary_detail_hef	The haughty lords of Ulthuan have been humbled this day, and their designs on the Great Vortex thwarted. The Archmage Caledor, who set the vortex in motion millennia ago, and who has been trapped within it ever since, endlessly maintaining the ritual that holds it in place, will remain trapped there beyond the aid of the weaklings who are his successors. The High Elves have lost their only chance to shore up the stuttering energies of the Vortex and will play no further part in the race to decide its fate.	false
event_feed_strings_text_wh2_event_feed_string_scripted_event_final_ritual_fails_secondary_detail_lzd	On this day the world has finally thrown off the shackles of its original masters. Many ages past, the Old Ones came to this world from beyond the stars in silver ships that plied the heavens. They reformed the continents to their own designs, and moulded the native inhabitants to better serve them. When the Great Catastrophe came, they fled, leaving their servants to fend for themselves with only fragments of a Great Plan to guide them. Now the descendants of those servants have failed, the Great Plan will forever remain in fragments, never to be fulfilled. The Lizardmen have lost any chance to influence the Great Vortex.	false
event_feed_strings_text_wh2_event_feed_string_scripted_event_final_ritual_fails_secondary_detail_skv	The great bell is cracked and the Great Horned One will howl in the void beyond the world for eternity. Two centuries ago, the Skaven Grey Seers ordered all clans to gather for the Great Summoning. Through dread magics, they summoned their god, the Great Horned Rat. Unable to remain in this world for long, the Horned One gifted his children the Pillar of Thirteen on which were scratched runes commanding that the Skaven cease their endless feuding and instead work together toward a great scheme. This scheme was to disrupt the power of the Great Vortex, using it to create a hole between dimensions, through which the Great Horned Rat could enter this world. Now the scheme has failed, and the Skaven have lost any opportunity they had to influence the Great Vortex.	false

event_feed_strings_text_wh2_pro08_event_feed_string_scripted_event_gotrek_felix_reappear_brt_secondary_detail	The Dragon was the largest living thing I had ever seen. Feeling all the strength gifted to me by my blade, Karaghul, I charged, despite every fibre of me wanting to flee.\\n\\nGotrek moved to the Dragon’s rear, chopping at its tail with his axe. It was unclear whether the blows were having any effect, but they had certainly gotten the beast's attention. It turned, and it was clear what was about to happen – the creature was preparing to engulf the Slayer in its hellfire breath.\\n\\nAt that moment, something triggered within me. Karaghul’s runes blazed bright and before realising it, I was bounding up the Dragon’s mountain of treasure and had leapt onto its head. Summoning all my strength, I drove my sword downwards. The spells woven into it by its ancient creators enabled the blade to pass freely through scale and flesh. Even as it met the resistance of the Dragon’s great skull, the blade twisted autonomously in my hands. Giving one last bellow, the Dragon’s entire body spasmed reflexively as it died and I was catapulted into a pool at the far end of the creature’s lair. As the Slayer hauled me out of the water, he gave me a wry smile. "Not bad, manling. Not bad at all."\\n\\n- From ‘My Travels With Gotrek, Vol. II’ by Herr Felix Jaeger (Altdorf Press)	false

event_feed_strings_text_wh2_pro08_event_feed_string_scripted_event_gotrek_felix_reappear_dwf_secondary_detail	Deep below Karak Eight Peaks, Gotrek and I found ourselves face to face with the most grotesque Troll I’d ever seen.\\n\\n"Time to die, filth!" Gotrek exclaimed, wildly lashing out at the monstrosity with his axe. Alas, the Chaos-mutated creature kept regenerating its wounds, no matter how fatal they seemed to be. Fearing Gotrek would eventually tire – which would undoubtedly spell the end for the both of us – I had to act. Grabbing a nearby oil-flask, I shimmied round to the Troll’s blind side and doused it with flammable liquid before setting the foul creature alight. Now inflamed, its wounds no longer convalesced and the tide of the fight immediately turned in Gotrek’s favour.\\n\\nWith a pained cry, the flaming Troll torch reeled backwards in a blaze of searing mutant flesh, forced back by the terrible gashes now being inflicted by the Slayer’s axe. Finally, it fell, and Gotrek raised his axe high above his head. "In the name of my ancestors!" he howled, "Die!". He brought his axe down like a thunderbolt, severing the creature’s foul head with one swipe. Unsurprisingly, the Troll did not rise again.\\n\\n- From 'My Travels With Gotrek, Vol. II’ by Herr Felix Jaeger (Altdorf Press)	false

event_feed_strings_text_wh2_pro08_event_feed_string_scripted_event_gotrek_felix_reappear_emp_secondary_detail	Channelling the dark energy of the amulet around its neck, the Vampire called its foul servants.\\n\\nFirst came a hail of enormous flapping wings and razor-sharp fangs ready to rend and tear. They were huge bats, larger than men with hooks at their wing tips. A clang of metal announced another threat – Ghouls wrapped in suits of armour sprung into a horrid semblance of life, shuffling towards us. I drew my sword and ducked from the slashing talons of another Fell Bat. Evading its next attack, I stabbed upwards into its belly as black bile spurted forth.\\n\\nGotrek’s mighty axe smashed through the Grave Guards’ breastplates to reveal their animated skeletal constructs, the red glow of their eyes fading as they fell. The Slayer then moved with insane fury towards the Vampire controlling them, looking like an unleashed god of battle. With frightening speed, he thundered his axe at the creature of the night, smashing the powerful talisman around its neck and burying the weapon into its chest. The remaining Grave Guards lost their animus and collapsed. The Fell Bats, no longer guided by Dark Magic, fluttered upwards. The Vampire screeched with unnatural rage as its body turned to putrefying flesh.\\n\\n- From ‘My Travels With Gotrek, Vol. II’ by Herr Felix Jaeger (Altdorf Press)	false

With the Slayer occupied, I only just managed to dodge a swipe of its massive claws before turning to run. As it gave chase, the Rat Ogre’s huge fists made the very ground beneath me tremble and I momentarily stumbled. It swung its dagger-like claws at me once again, but I managed to dive forwards and opportunistically stab it between the ribs. It writhed in pain, but still managed to club me to the ground with its huge arm. Raising its fists over its head, the marauding monster prepared to deliver the death blow...\\n\\nThen, the Rat Ogre suddenly toppled sideways, its right leg falling away from its body in a shower of blood as it fell thrashing and screaming. The Slayer stood behind it, his axe dripping with gore. "Nothing but an overgrown sewer rat!" he said. Lifting his axe high, he chopped down through the beast’s bony skull with a sickening crunch.\\n\\n- From ‘My Travels With Gotrek, Vol. II’ by Herr Felix Jaeger (Altdorf Press)	false

event_feed_strings_text_wh2_pro08_event_feed_string_scripted_event_gotrek_felix_reappear_teb_secondary_detail	"Ready, manling?" Gotrek said. I tightened the grip on my blade, feeling the muscles on my forearm go as rigid as steel bands. "As I’ll ever be." I uttered.\\n\\nThe Slayer’s wild laughter rang out as he charged, and a Beastman lackey’s skull was immediately split like a melon. I was set upon by the other scimitar-wielding hench-beast, who was strong but unskilled. Within seconds I had ducked beneath a wild swing of its weapon and skewered the brute’s belly, its intestines pouring out over its hands as it fell in a morbid heap.\\n\\nGotrek was engaged in a duel with the Brayherd leader. The muscular, goat-headed beast was a frightening sight, both enormous and cycloptic. It swung its gore-covered club in a massive arc, but Gotrek skipped back out of range, catching the head of the crude weapon in the curve of his axe blade. With a swift jerk, the one-eyed beast was disarmed. He struck the creature’s leg and severed its tendons, knocking it to the ground. The Dwarf’s face was an expression of cold, merciless fury as his ancient axe descended like that of an executioner. Spitting on the decapitated corpse, the Slayer shook his head in disgust. "Too easy."\\n\\n- From ‘My Travels With Gotrek, Vol. II’ by Herr Felix Jaeger (Altdorf Press)	false

event_feed_strings_text_wh_event_feed_string_scripted_event_chaos_invasion_defeated_secondary_detail	As the last of the Chaos hordes is scoured from the face of the world, an awful silence descends. More than a silence; an absence of sound which echoes the all-consuming void without. All creation is stilled, breath held in anticipation of the final cataclysm.\\n\\nThen, tentatively, gently, life reasserts itself. Not in a grand way to echo those who sought to end everything, but in the small ways which of themselves are life. Birdsong pierces the silence, hesitant at first, then swelling; a defiant hymn to creation, borne on a soft wind that sifts dust onto the scattered corpses littering the bloody plain of battle. And the spell is broken. Bloodied veterans, survivors, refugees - all draw breath into their aching lungs and weep at the taste and smell of victory, peace, and life.\\n\\nYet what is life if not the constant striving of one against the other? After all, every hedgerow is a bloody battleground, every plant a murderer, every creature red in tooth and claw. Even as the weak raise their eyes to a golden future, the wise are glancing about to see who will make the first move in seizing it for themselves. The shield of civilisation which turned aside the deadly thrust of Chaos is now a heavy and cumbersome thing.

event_feed_strings_text_wh_event_feed_string_scripted_event_chaos_invasion_defeated_secondary_detail_vmp	As the final breath is torn shrieking from the last Warriors of Chaos, the silence of the grave descends upon the world. The broken corpses littering the battlefield lie motionless, their futile struggles over. Death is the only victor here.\\n\\nThe stillness is broken. A chill wind rises, heavy with the taint of the eternal tomb, blows upon the tatters of once-proud banners now trampled into the mud, and the feathers of the carrion birds as they gorge upon the fallen.\\n\\nSuch is the way of the world. Great Lords, arrogant in the strength of their arms, vie with each other for dominance, oblivious to the fact that death, patient and inexorable, waits for all living things. Even as many raise their eyes to a golden future, there are those who wish to make the first move and seize it for themselves. The shield of civilisation, which turned aside the deadly thrust of Chaos, is now a heavy and cumbersome thing. Those who cast it aside first will be quickest with their blades - a knife in the back being the surest of all. Comrades who stood shoulder to shoulder on the field of battle now step apart and take each other’s measure. Alliances begin to unravel and the storm clouds gather once more.	false

There are rumours that the barbarous tribes residing in the shadow of Chaos have ceased striving against each other for the attention of the Dark Gods and are instead banding together. Suckling at the teat of Chaos, the hordes grow in strength. It seems only a matter of time before the dam breaks and a tide of ruin bursts forth to engulf the Old World, corrupting or destroying all in its path.\\n\\nMarshal your strength, nurture the sinews of war, build your walls high, gather warriors to your banner and temper them in the crucible of battle, so that when the time comes you may yet weather the storm!	false

In their service, he has devoted himself to the world’s destruction, defeating all challengers and rising to a position of dominance over all in the Chaos Wastes, achieving the ultimate accolade - his dark coronation as the Everchosen; the vessel through which the Dark Gods unite their followers to turn the world into a Realm of Chaos. It is to his banner that the Warriors of Chaos have been flocking, and it is his malign will that now drives them forth in a terrible wave of destruction destined to sweep all before it.\\n\\nThe earth groans beneath the iron-shod feet of Archaon’s numberless horde, and with him comes death.

Their corrupt forces wax ever stronger, and now their agents are abroad, spreading the foul corruption of their malign Gods.\\n\\nOn their heels come bands of marauding warriors led by the most zealous of the Chaos Lords, eager to wreak destruction in the name of the Ruinous Powers. And all the while, ever more warriors flock to some focal point in the Chaos Wastes, a nexus of power which transcends their petty rivalries and impels them to join with the numberless horde.\\n\\nDoom approaches, and it is only in strength that any hope may be found!	false

Not for nothing is he known as the Great Deceiver, the Changer of Ways. Ever does he seek to guide mortals along paths destined to increase his own power, showing favour to those who use cunning or influence to manipulate and control the world, and watching in delight as his conspiracies unfold. The Master of Subtlety, his plots are infinitely complex and interwoven. He is the principal architect of secret alliances between his brother Gods, and also the Lord of the Grand Betrayal.\\n\\nThrough his servant, he has guided your advancement, watching and waiting until the moment is ripe to make his own move and sweep the board clear.
