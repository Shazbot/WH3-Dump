technologies_long_description_wh_dlc03_tech_bst_ancient_paths	The Beastmen have been traversing the deep forests for countless generations. And so the beast-paths have formed, deep ruts hidden in the undergrowth that even the huntsmen of the Empire would struggle to discover. Some beast-paths fall out of use, lost for generations, only to be discovered again by Ungor trackers many years later. These ancient ways are seen as a boon by the Bray-Shamans, their use encouraged to prevent such routes falling into ignorance once again.	false

However, when the opportunity to hunt fresh blood-grounds comes (perhaps the Bray-Shamans have negotiated with rival tribes or a previous threat has been neutralised) then the Gors will rejoice, for there is no greater joy than hunting in strange lands with fresh scents, new lairs, and greater prey! 	false
technologies_long_description_wh_dlc03_tech_bst_bountiful_herdstone	Beastmen put great stock in their herdstones, for they are physical monuments to their malefic, Chaotic masters. A herdstone inscribed in runes from the dark tongue and washed in blood from a warherd's most hated of enemies will provide a greater bounty than lesser herdstones.	false
technologies_long_description_wh_dlc03_tech_bst_defiled_honour	Beastmen prefer close combat. This comes from no place of honour, it is simply what bestial folk do best. Only for results do their raging Gods care, and if this can be achieved by slaying up close - or from a greater distance - then so be it!	false
technologies_long_description_wh_dlc03_tech_bst_drunken_fury	It is always a bit of mystery from where some Beastmen, most notably, Centigors, get their grog or acidic wine. Mostly, it is stolen from more advanced races, but there are rumours of herds stumbling across fermenting fruit and honey and even given rudimentary instructions on how to turn such bounty into liquor by the Bray-Shamans. In any case, Beastmen are full of rage and violence.	false
technologies_long_description_wh_dlc03_tech_bst_embrace_of_chaos		false
technologies_long_description_wh_dlc03_tech_bst_encircled_prey	Beastmen are expert ambushers, using the undergrowth and the secret beast-paths to their advantage, encircling their foes before striking against the enemy from several different directions. The more experienced a warherd becomes the better they ambush, being able to surround their opponents with impressive speed. 	false
technologies_long_description_wh_dlc03_tech_bst_fell_rituals	There is a reason that the darkest, most fell of rituals are rarely spoken. To utter such things is to risk more than your life - your very soul could be consumed by Daemons as a tasty morsel for the servants of the Chaos Gods if they believe the utterer not worthy enough. Yet a Bray-Shaman who speaks the dark tongue and pleases his masters may see his tribe greatly rewarded. 	false
technologies_long_description_wh_dlc03_tech_bst_gaze_of_the_dark_gods	While the Dark Gods may favour those mortals who willingly give their souls to Chaos, Beastmen are the true Children of Chaos. They are born or created to be part of Chaos, intrinsically so, rather than persuaded, tempted, or seduced. And so, when the gaze of the Ruinous Powers falls upon the Beastmen, it is as a parent looking upon their quarrelsome children. 	false
technologies_long_description_wh_dlc03_tech_bst_gore_drunk	If the Beastlord follows the tenets of Slaa - as the Dark Prince is oft-known among the Beastmen - then he will allow his Gors to rut and mewl and wallow in their own fifth, as well as bathe in and consume enemy blood. This leads many Beastmen into a state of euphoria; to become 'gore-drunk'. A generous Beastlord who grants his Gors such a boon will gather many followers.	false
technologies_long_description_wh_dlc03_tech_bst_grisly_trophies	Gors will drape themselves in gory tokens and grisly trophies to mark their triumphs. Although the Beastmen have many foes, they take particular delight in despoiling the artefacts and corpses of mankind, for that is a literal sign of their ultimate goal: to end civilisation. To wear such vile icons about its disgusting person empowers the wearer and commands respect.	false
technologies_long_description_wh_dlc03_tech_bst_heart_of_the_dark	Whether a true-born Gor, or one of the mongrel things that was once a man, a Beastman's heart is wholly owned by Chaos. Yet there are those beasts whose soul is blacker than most; they are the chieftains, Beastlords and other agents of the Dark Powers with the wherewithal or physical might to emerge dominant over the herds. 	false
technologies_long_description_wh_dlc03_tech_bst_hives_of_pestilence	The more Gors and true-horns fight for their place by the side of the Beastlord, the larger the warherds become. The strongest and meanest of these recruits are selected for the Bestigor herds, but for Gors that don't make the cut there remains plenty of opportunity to sow destruction and then - maybe - impress their chieftain in the battles to come.	false
technologies_long_description_wh_dlc03_tech_bst_man_cleavers	Large blades, scavenged from battlefields or stolen from the armouries of man, Dwarf and even Orc, are ideal for larger Gors and Minotaurs. These weapons are prized by the bulkier Beastmen, as a strike from one endowed with bestial muscles is often enough to slice right through the waist of an armoured man.	false
technologies_long_description_wh_dlc03_tech_bst_messenger_of_the_bray	The Chaos Gods always have need of willing agents - mortal, horned or otherwise. Should these agents prove useful, then they will be rewarded by the granting of boons and favour. However, to be under the scrutiny of such Dark Powers is often a double-edged blade, for the Gods do not tolerate failure. 	false

technologies_long_description_wh_dlc03_tech_bst_the_days_of_wrath	In the north, the Everchosen makes his plans, but the Cloven Ones have much say in the Old World's fate also. Such dark times - such days of wrath - will be a chance for all Beastmen to be touched by Chaos - to feel the Dark Powers'  strength ooze into their twisted souls. 	false
technologies_long_description_wh_dlc03_tech_bst_the_endless_hunt	The Beastmen have always hunted the blood-grounds for quarry. Nowadays, things are no different, but should whispers of a brayherd spread then the herds will come in force and Gors from far-afield tribes join, for their is much glory in raiding and murdering in the name of the Dark Gods.	false
technologies_long_description_wh_dlc03_tech_bst_the_kalkengard_larder	Ragush of the Bloody Horn was a monstrous Doombull that put the poor town of Kalkengard to the torch. Its defenders were rounded up and the choicest mortals eaten, but those left alive after the Minotaurs and Gors had feasted faced a far more horrible fate. They were hung from the burnt ruins, rocky spires, and trees in the area. Whenever the herds of Ragush hungered, they would return to the larder to feed. It is a brutish concept that other warherds have doubtless copied. 	false
technologies_long_description_wh_dlc03_tech_bst_the_path_to_war	It is on the path to war that the brayherds must travel. If a Beastlord is to rise in power and stature, then he must make battle with man and fellow Gor, Greenskin and rat-filth, beardling and fey tree-clinger alike. All must fall before the blades and horns of Chaos' Children - all must die by the Beastmen's bray!	false
technologies_long_description_wh_dlc03_tech_bst_the_rewards_of_ruin	The rewards of Ruin are hate, rage, fury, and a vile vigour that keeps the Gors fighting fit; it is said to be a "dark blessing". The Chaos Gods demand their servants be of rude health, so that they may despoil and destroy in their twisted, Ruinous name.	false
technologies_long_description_wh_dlc03_tech_bst_the_seed_of_hate		false
technologies_long_description_wh_dlc03_tech_bst_true_horn	The Bray-Shamans claim that only true-horns can tame a Razorgor - the fierce porcine beasts of rage and burden - for they share a common link. Both are savage and when their eyes meet there is a common bond and hatred of everything that is not of the wild. 	false
technologies_long_description_wh_dlc03_tech_bst_twisted_visions	Although Bray-Shamans receive more disturbing dreams and visions than other Gors, the Gods choose other conduits as needed to project their Ruinous will upon their minions. Such visions may be hard to interpret but other episodes are easier to understand and act upon. 	false
technologies_long_description_wh_dlc03_tech_bst_vitriolic_temperament	All Beastmen are fell-tempered beasts, but some are quicker to rage than others; considered to be touched by the Granter of Savage Hate and known as 'Khorngors' by some. A wise Beastlord will bind such creatures together in herds and send them forth into the thick of the fighting. 	false

technologies_long_description_wh_dlc05_tech_1_asuryan	Though Asuryan enjoys the title 'Creator', and is considered the highest of the Elven pantheon by the High Elves, he is just another deity to the Wood Elves of Athel Loren. In the Pantheonic Mandela of the Asrai he is banished to the outer circle, while Kurnous and Isha take pride of place at the centre.	false
technologies_long_description_wh_dlc05_tech_1_cadai	The Elven Pantheon is split into two distinct groups, the Cadai and the Cytharai. The Cadai are the gods of the heavens and are openly worshipped by all the Asrai. The Cytharai, on the other hand, are the gods of the Underworld, or Mirai, and are often appeased rather than worshipped. As the Elves of Athel Loren are free to worship as they choose, their are those who take the Cytharai to heart; rumours say that the warriors of the Pine Crags have forsaken Kurnous for his vengeful counterpart, Anaeth Raema.	false
technologies_long_description_wh_dlc05_tech_1_hoeth	Hoeth is the Lord of Wisdom and it is said that he shared the wisdom of the gods with the first Elves. Asuryan was enraged by his actions and as a punishment set Hoeth's great library ablaze. He is the deity of choice for those seeking greater understanding, those who wish to know more of the world and their place in it.	false
technologies_long_description_wh_dlc05_tech_1_isha	Isha is mother to all. The legends of Athel Loren tell that Asuryan forbade her from involving herself in the lives of her mortal children. Heart broken by this decree, she chose to take mortal form along with her consort, the God of the Hunt, Kurnous. Together they became Ariel and Orion, and Athel Loren was transformed into a realm divinely blessed.	false
technologies_long_description_wh_dlc05_tech_1_isha_mini	Isha is mother to all. The legends of Athel Loren tell that Asuryan forbade her from involving herself in the lives of her mortal children. Heart broken by this decree, she chose to take mortal form along with her consort, the God of the Hunt, Kurnous. Together they became Ariel and Orion, and Athel Loren was transformed into a realm divinely blessed.	false
technologies_long_description_wh_dlc05_tech_1_kurnous	As the God of the Hunt, Kurnous embodies much of what it means to be Asrai and as such is held in high esteem by all the Elves of Athel Loren. In his mortal form, as the god-king Orion, his life is tied to the seasons. Born anew each Spring, he walks willingly into his funeral pyre come Midwinter. This is not before he has led his people on the Wild Hunt, a call of the wild that sees even the most civilised of the Asrai abandon themselves to their primal urges for its duration, allowing peaceful coexistence for the rest of the year.	false
technologies_long_description_wh_dlc05_tech_1_ladrielle	The Lady of the Mists is the patron of those who travel the wilderness and protector of all that is lost or hidden. There are many Elves in Athel Loren who chose to live in the wilderness rather than suffer the dull life of a courtier. Waywatchers and Waystalkers feel the call of the forest coursing through their veins and find, from an early age, that they are more at home in the wild places of the Deepwood than in the halls of their kin.	false
technologies_long_description_wh_dlc05_tech_1_lileath	Like many of her fellows, Lileath seldom involves herself directly in the affairs of the Elves, choosing instead to send messages through the medium of dream. This Goddess of the Moon and patron of seers, scholars and mages is said to be able to see the true intent of one's heart. She does not judge based on what an Elf does, but on what he intends to do. 	false
technologies_long_description_wh_dlc05_tech_1_loec	Loec the Trickster is beloved of Wardancers and all those who tell the history of Athel Loren through song and dance. He is a benevolent deity who gifts his followers with cat-like grace; all he asks in return is unswerving loyalty and ritual war dances. However, Loec's love does not end when an Elf leaves the mortal realm. He has even been known to steal souls from Slaanesh, using his cunning and intellect to win their freedom from an eternity of torment.	false
technologies_long_description_wh_dlc05_tech_1_the_ancients	Older than the forest itself, the Ancients of Athel Loren are to be revered and feared. Sadly, many of them have passed into memory and those that survive to this day are not the gentle forest spirits of old, but vengeful guardians bent on protecting their home no matter the cost. When an Ancient dies, their essence is absorbed back into the forest and all their wisdom passes on to their fellows. Only two remain, possessed of the knowledge and pain of all their fallen brethren.	false
technologies_long_description_wh_dlc05_tech_1_vaul	The battles that raged between the gods in millennia past had many casualties, and Vaul was chief amongst them. Wounded by Khaine, Vaul is both blind and crippled, but this does nothing to lessen his skill. He is the God of the Forge and patron to all those who work an anvil. He toils endlessly, creating weapons of great power to pass on to the Elves, for he has seen their doom and knows they will need all the help they can get.	false
technologies_long_description_wh_dlc05_tech_2_addaioth	Addaioth is known as the Bringer of Wrath and Fire, and is one of the few Ellinilli to survive the trick played on their father by the Trickster God, Loec. Unlike his siblings, who fled and hid from their father, he met him in battle and the two fought for three days and three nights. However, Addaioth was no match for his father. Luckily for him, Ladrielle saw his predicament and blinded Ellinill, spiriting Addaioth away to the mortal realm.	false
technologies_long_description_wh_dlc05_tech_2_anath_raema	This vengeful goddess is known as the Savage Huntress. Where Kurnous teaches his followers that to take from the forest without giving back is wrong, Anath Raema encourages it. It is said that she once had feelings for Kurnous but he spurned her affections and it was rejection that turned her heart to vengeance. Though her worship is frowned upon in the high courts of Athel Loren, there are whispers that the warriors of the Pine Crags have chosen her over Kurnous.	false
technologies_long_description_wh_dlc05_tech_2_atharti	This Elven goddess has the power to turn mortal men into bowing supplicants, she is a master seductress and can see the deepest desires of any Elf's heart. This makes her a dangerous deity to follow - she encourages her followers to completely give themselves over to their desires at the cost of all else. She is also the sister of Hekarti and the two have a fierce rivalry.	false
technologies_long_description_wh_dlc05_tech_2_cytharai	The Elven Pantheon is split into two distinct groups, the Cadai and the Cytharai. The Cadai are the Gods of the Heavens and are openly worshipped by all the Asrai. The Cytharai, on the other hand, are the Gods of the Underworld, or Mirai, and are often appeased rather than worshipped. As the Elves of Athel Loren are free to worship as they choose, their are those who take the Cytharai to heart; rumours say that the warriors of the Pine Crags have forsaken Kurnous for his vengeful counterpart, Anaeth Raema.	false
technologies_long_description_wh_dlc05_tech_2_drakira	The Queen of Vengeance, Drakira, is ever ready to help an Elf seeking retribution for some slight or other. She choses to spend her time away from the other gods and as such is the favoured goddess of the Waystalkers, who prefer to spend their time deep in the forest. Though Drakira is quick to grant her gifts, they seldom come without a price and she is just as quick to claim that in payment.	false
technologies_long_description_wh_dlc05_tech_2_eldrazor	As the patron of duellists, Eldrazor is venerated by those who fight for honour. This makes him particularly popular with the Eternal Guard, who are often called upon to fight trials by combat in the name of their Lord. To fight in the Arena of Blades is the highest honour an Eternal Guard can hope to achieve. Not only because it is a mortal extension of Eldrazor's Arena of Death, but also because by sacrificing his life he could save thousands of others.	false
technologies_long_description_wh_dlc05_tech_2_ellinill	The Lord of Destruction has a complicated past and an even more complicated relationship with his children. Legend tells that he had over a hundred offspring, known as the Ellinilli, and together they brought untold destruction to the Elves. Isha pleaded with the other gods to stop the path of destruction, but her pleas fell on deaf ears - deaf except for Loec, who saw an opportunity to use his fabled wit against Ellinill. Convincing him that his children were plotting a coup, Ellinill devoured them all.	false
technologies_long_description_wh_dlc05_tech_2_ereth_khial	Also known as the Pale Queen, Ereth Khial is the Supreme Goddess of the Underworld. Unhappy with her place in the Elven Pantheon, she spent most of her time plotting ways to topple Asuryan from his throne. However, she has bigger things to worry about now, namely Slaanesh. The army of Elven souls she was attempting to build is somewhat diminished of late, as the Dark Prince claims many of the choicest specimens for himself.	false
technologies_long_description_wh_dlc05_tech_2_estreath	Estreath is one of the few Ellinilli to have survived the wrath of their father. When word reached him that Ellinill had been tricked by Loec and intended to devour his children, Estreath fled to the mortal world. There he remains to this day, refusing to return to the heavens for fear of his father's retribution.	false
technologies_long_description_wh_dlc05_tech_2_hekarti	Hekarti is a goddess of magic, but unlike Lileath she represents its darker side. A capricious deity, she pays close attention to the Elves' wants and desires, whereas other gods chose to avoid contact with them. As a result, she often finds herself in direct competition with her sister Atharti, the Goddess of Desire. 	false
technologies_long_description_wh_dlc05_tech_2_hukon	The Sunderer is the Elven God of Earthquakes and one of the five Ellinilli to survive the wrath of his father by fleeing to the mortal world. Like all good fathers, Ellinill held a deep-seated distrust for his children. Although their power emanated from him, Ellinill worried that should they unite they would have the power to overthrow him. It  was this distrust that Loec used to put an end to the Ellinilli's reign of terror.	false
technologies_long_description_wh_dlc05_tech_2_khaine	Khaine is the Bloody-handed God of Murder. Where the High Elves keep their worship of him to a level that maintains his favour without completely surrendering themselves to him, the Dark Elves give body, mind and soul to Khaine. Wood Elves however, choose their deity according to their own natures. All Wood Elves hold Kurnous and Isha above all others, but are just as happy to embrace the wildness of Khaine as they are to embody the compassion of Lileath.	false
technologies_long_description_wh_dlc05_tech_2_mathlann	As Lord of the Deeps, Mathlann is venerated by sailors and those that travel the deep blue sea. However, he is an uncaring deity, just as likely to curse his followers as he is to grant them safe passage. He is also known as King of Storm and Sea and has been known to send many a loyal Elf to their death. Worship at your peril!	false

technologies_long_description_wh_dlc05_tech_2_morai_heg	Morai Heg is the Weaver of Prophecy and Keeper of Souls - she knows and sees everything and is responsible for laying out the secrets of the future in the stars. Each and every Elven death is foretold by her. The archers of Athel Loren have a deep respect for Morai Heg; no Elven archer would shoot down a raven as they are her chosen messengers.	false
technologies_long_description_wh_dlc05_tech_2_nethu	Nethu is the gatekeeper of the Underworld and son to Ereth Khial. He is tasked with ensuring that the few souls claimed by his mother before they could be devoured by Slaanesh remain trapped until Rhana Dhandra, and that no living soul breaks into the realm of the dead to steal its secrets.  	false
technologies_long_description_wh_dlc05_tech_2_the_rephallim	These shadowy spirits prey upon the souls of the Tree Kin. Only the most powerful of Elven souls become Tree Kin, so they are prized above all others. The Rephallim were once caged within the Wildwood, contained by the Waystone markers that keep so many dark and vengeful spirits trapped. However, they were released by Ereth Khial, the Supreme Goddess of the Underworld, as she sought to reclaim some of the souls lost to the Chaos God Slaanesh.	false
technologies_long_description_wh_dlc07_tech_brt_chivalry_beastmen_1	As the sacred woodland of Athel Loren is outside Bretonnia’s official boundaries, there are no Wood Elves living within its forests. Unfortunately, this means that Beastmen, the hideous Children of Chaos, infest the glades and copses with their fell rituals and darker appetites. Ever since the Great Battles of Bretonnian history, when the dreaded brayherds swept across the land in a stampede of destruction, joining with the foul, rampaging Greenskins to compound the misery of the local people. Some say that they may even exist in far greater numbers than previously thought, but no one is really prepared to venture into the woods to find out!	false
technologies_long_description_wh_dlc07_tech_brt_chivalry_chaos_1	In Bretonnia from time to time, and with increasing regularity as the forces of Chaos strengthen their nefarious hold on the mortal world, formerly loyal and courageous dukes are tempted by promises of power and favour from the Ruinous Powers. No one, not even the brave and true Grail Knights, is immune from the outstretched tentacles of eternal madness to which such dark pacts give purchase. Yet the Lady of the Lake, through her servants the Fay Enchantress and courageous King Louen Leoncoeur, is ever-vigilant – ready to act in defence of Bretonnia wherever and whenever the Chaos Gods’ creeping, insidious influence is detected.	false

technologies_long_description_wh_dlc07_tech_brt_chivalry_greenskins_1	Greenskins are central to the Bretonnian story, having been defeated by the Grail Companions in large numbers during the Great Battles. However, many years have passed since they have dared to raid in large groups away from their mountain strongholds, and some now fear they are gathering strength to move against Bretonnia once again. Attacks on border villages by small Warbands are not uncommon these days, with the farming and mining communities on the fringes especially vulnerable in Winter when cut off from the rest of Bretonnia. When the snow melts in Spring, at least one village has been reduced to rubble, its population dead or missing, and the stench of dung piles – the calling card of these foul, green interlopers – thick in the air.	false

technologies_long_description_wh_dlc07_tech_brt_chivalry_norsca_1	The Northmen – the barbarian tribes allied to the Gods of Chaos – are ancient enemies of Bretonnia. During the Tenth Great Battle, Gilles le Breton and his Grail Companions came to the relief of the great port-city of L’Anguille, which was under attack from forces led by the formidable warrior-Lord Svengar of the Skaelings. The Companion Lord Marcus duelled with the giant Norscan warrior, defeating him and triggering a full-scale retreat of the Norse attackers, who hurriedly turned their ships around and sailed away northwards once more. A devastating victory was won that day, but nevertheless the ports of Bretonnia cast their eyes out to the ocean in constant vigilance even now.	false

technologies_long_description_wh_dlc07_tech_brt_chivalry_vampires_1	Being a superstitious lot, Bretonnians are not ones to take the threat of incursions by the Undead lightly. The idea of the dead walking is particularly abhorrent to them and a constant source of fear. Their history, especially that of the Great Battles, contains several tales of the Companions facing off against Necromancers and their reanimated hordes. More recently, Bretonnia seems to suffer more frequently from unnatural things defying nature and rising from their tombs at the bidding of Dark Magicians and Vampire Counts. This is especially true upriver from the cursed land of Mousillon, where waterlogged Undead crawl their way upstream, occasionally jumping out of the water and attacking unlucky passers-by!	false
technologies_long_description_wh_dlc07_tech_brt_chivalry_wood_elves_1	It is never wise to go against the Fey Folk of the forest, for they have long memories and their vengeance – for even the most trivial of slights – is total. In times past, men have exploited the forests, harvesting the trees for their selfish ends and have felt the Wood Elves’ wrath in return. As a result, the Bretonnians mostly stay away from Elven lands these days, so as not to tempt fate. For their part, the Elves do not consider the lives of ‘mayflies’ to be worth their time, so generally keep themselves to themselves where possible. There have, however, been instances of co-operation between the two races – for the good of the trees, of course. The Fourth Great Battle saw a horde of filthy, ravening Greenskins putting the forest to the flame and so the noble, courageous Grail Companions came to their aid, stopping the disgusting green tide dead in its tracks.	false
technologies_long_description_wh_dlc07_tech_brt_economy_farm_1	The tools and agricultural techniques used by Bretonnian peasants are considered by many to be rather backwards compared to those used by the other nations of men. Occasionally, cost-effective solutions developed by their counterparts in the Empire are adopted, while others less so. The main problem is that good tools are hard to find in Bretonnia and hence, are much more expensive. This means that less affluent Bretonnian nobles will not often see good reason to provide their peasant workers with better equipment if it can be avoided - to them, there is simply no reason to make a peasant’s job easier at a greater cost to themselves.	false
technologies_long_description_wh_dlc07_tech_brt_economy_farm_2	Ploughs are important to any agriculturally-focused economy, such as Bretonnia. Along with the pitchfork, they are a staple tool of the peasants who toil the fields, making the work slightly less back-breaking than would otherwise be the case, but not enough to make their miserable lives easier by any real degree. Increasing plough sizes does mean they spend less hours actually ploughing, freeing them up to do some other form of crippling manual labour for their noble masters. 	false
technologies_long_description_wh_dlc07_tech_brt_economy_farm_3	The ability of the Knightly class to effectively defend Bretonnia from harm rests with the peasants, who work the land to provide their nobles with the sustenance needed to fight wars in their name. The sheer amount of arable land in the region means that the waterways feeding the crops must work efficiently, lest the yields produced not be high enough. By the digging irrigation ditches, water can be directed to man-made watering holes around the foothills, where the pastoral farmers graze their animals, and to the rolling fields where maize and other crops are grown for their masters’ tables. The peasants themselves, however, rarely benefit from the abundance of high quality meat and fresh vegetables produced, and must content themselves with the gruel and scraps that are the lot of their pathetic, near-worthless lives.	false
technologies_long_description_wh_dlc07_tech_brt_economy_farm_4	Although water pumping technology could be used to bring fresh water to the Bretonnian peasants, instead of the stagnant well water they are forced to drink, that is not considered important by the nobles whose land they work. As far as they are concerned, increasing produce yields is far more important than the needs of their workers, and so they are forbidden from using them for their own purposes. When more crops are grown than are needed to sustain the population, the excess can be used to trade with merchants for those essential luxuries – wine, for instance. Any other considerations, such as the welfare of the peasant population, are irrelevant.	false

technologies_long_description_wh_dlc07_tech_brt_economy_industry_1	Weaving cloth by hand is no easy task, as any clothiers will tell you. Unlike their neighbours in the technologically-burgeoning Empire, Bretonnians must do without the new-fangled machinery that saves labour and increases production. Such things might give the peasantry ideas, and are therefore eschewed by the kingdom’s noble, ruling class. Large-scale fabric production is a necessary evil, however, and so the work must be undertaken by hand or with the simplest, hand-driven looms. One effective way of keeping output high enough to meet demand is to increase the size of the spools used; anything further advanced might just trigger an industrial revolution – something no Bretonnian ruler wants to see!	false
technologies_long_description_wh_dlc07_tech_brt_economy_industry_2	Although the majority of Bretonnian weavers use simple wooden hand-looms, the pressures of increased production quotas have caused many breakages and repairs. Although loathed to do so, nobles have taken advantage of the importation of raw materials into Bretonnia – metals from Dwarf traders, for instance – to reinforce existing equipment or build new, more robust machinery from metal that will not break so easily.	false
technologies_long_description_wh_dlc07_tech_brt_economy_industry_3	In Bretonnia, the life of anyone outside the ruling class is tough. In keeping with natural order, the nobles take the vast majority of goods produced – and the profits therein – from the peasants who live on their land and do all the physical work. Although their skills are never recognised, weavers and other cloth workers are essential to Bretonnian industry, as the fruits of their labour directly bring income into the kingdom via trade with the travelling merchants that constantly move through the land. Naturally, the nobles do not approve of any activities that take peasants away from their toil, but even they have to admit that passing on knowledge to the next generation is useful – so there is someone to take over when a peasant craftsman eventually drops, exhausted, for the final time.	false
technologies_long_description_wh_dlc07_tech_brt_economy_industry_4	Clothiers and seamstresses play an important role in Bretonnia, operating in a society which cares much about its image. For Bretonnians, chivalric virtues are not only expounded through their actions, but also through their appearance. Knights will often wear battle-damaged cloaks as a constant reminder of past glories, and some non-combatant nobles mimic this trend by having slits artificially cut into their own. Unsurprisingly, attempts to fake battle damage are frowned upon – so seamstresses are employed to adorn such cloaks with fabrics provided by the local clothier, making it clear that the battle damage is decorative.	false

technologies_long_description_wh_dlc07_tech_brt_economy_industry_start	As prolific builders of castles, improved stone masonry techniques and construction methods appeal to even the aggressively-feudalist Bretonnians. Unlike other areas of technological advancement, Bretonnian nobles are very keen on anything that speeds the process of building and maintaining the castles and strongholds from which their lands are defended from invaders. As a result, many improved construction methods have come along quickly and naturally out of necessity. It is important to remember, however, that the nobles’ preferred solution – in any situation – is always to throw more peasants at a problem until it goes away!	false

technologies_long_description_wh_dlc07_tech_brt_economy_other_1	Almshouses in Bretonnia are not happy places, but serve an important function for the peasant-class, who endlessly toil for the nobility in exchange for their ‘protection’ from evil in its various guises. Naturally, peasants only know servitude, leaving the Knights to carry out the heroic deeds so revered in Bretonnian society. Such loyalty is not reciprocated, however, for if peasants become afflicted by disease or injury to the extent that they can no longer toil the fields or work the looms, they are simply replaced by others in better physical condition. Almshouses provide a modicum of refuge to those wretched individuals who find themselves in such unfortunate predicaments. Such places are not a soft-option though – residents lives remaining hard, they are still expected to work long hours at menial tasks, with barely enough food provided and absolutely no sympathy, cures or palliative care offered.	false
technologies_long_description_wh_dlc07_tech_brt_economy_other_2	The structure of Bretonnian society is not concerned with the peasants – the vast, faceless rabble who do all the actual work, suffer and die without ever finding solace for their woes or redress for their concerns. For that reason, it’s very hard for a noble to truly know how many live and work his lands. Some landowners have thousands in order to work their sizeable estates, others just a few hundred to operate the looms which produce the cloth he trades in order to prop up his already-considerable wealth. It makes sense then, for each to survey his workers and send details of their numbers to the capital so the king knows how many can be levied to fight in his armies in the event of war.	false
technologies_long_description_wh_dlc07_tech_brt_economy_other_3	In the context of Bretonnia, it is misleading to think of the pitchfork as a symbol of peasant rebellion, since such uprisings are so rare within its dukedoms. The low-born are far more likely to use a pitchfork to defend their noble’s land than turn it against the noble himself. It also means that when war inevitably comes, he doesn’t have to spend valuable resources on weapons that he could otherwise spend on arming his Knights. Therefore, the high-born know that to give a Bretonnian peasant a pitchfork is to hand him a useful tool with which to work the fields and forearm him for the battles ahead.	false
technologies_long_description_wh_dlc07_tech_brt_economy_other_4	Naturally, in a feudal society such as Bretonnia, peasant handouts are extremely rare, so when they do occur, they have a profound effect. Knights typically never share their riches with the low-born, be it battle-loot or the profits of his peasants ceaseless labour. Bretonnian peasants are, to a man, pitifully-poor individuals, who serve their betters past the point of total exhaustion while paying taxes almost as high as their paltry wages. Even if they are fortunate enough to become Men-at-Arms and take to the battlefield alongside Knights of the Realm, they must still pay for their own rations and bring their own equipment.	false

technologies_long_description_wh_dlc07_tech_brt_economy_start	Bretonnian society looks down on progress, for such things may lead to ‘undesirable’ changes to the balance of power. This makes for a haphazard economy which does not stockpile goods when it would perhaps be sensible to do so. Generally, trade is what keeps the kingdom going, with nobles dealing with the merchant class when necessary in order to obtain the goods they need and trading wine and textiles in return. Of course, the village communities who do all of the actual production work do not benefit from this – diffusion of wealth being an alien concept in such a staunchly feudal society. Those landowners whose local industries may be suffering simply drive their peasants harder until the profits made are high enough to keep them in the manner to which they are accustomed – as is their noble birthright of course.	false
technologies_long_description_wh_dlc07_tech_brt_economy_trade_1	The sea merchants who operate off Bretonnia’s shores constantly need tougher, more manoeuvrable ships. The rapidly changing currents off the coast, extreme gales that blow in from the Great Ocean to the west, pirates, and – not to forget – the sea-monsters who infest its waters are notoriously dangerous to navigate. Even the most experienced sailors find it difficult to avoid a shipwreck if they find themselves in an unfamiliar waters. These difficulties can sometimes hamper trade, since a lot of goods flowing in and out of Bretonnian ports use the congested, land-hugging ship-routes. 	false
technologies_long_description_wh_dlc07_tech_brt_economy_trade_2	Bretonnia wears a fair mask over the not-uncommon presence of corruption. The harbourmasters who control access to all its lucrative trade ports make a decent living, but not always entirely by honest means. Often, following receipt of certain payments, they are able to direct ‘approved’ smugglers to safe moorings around Bretonnia’s perilous coast in order to avoid the tolls and duties levied at its major ports – knowledge they are often more than willing to share for the right price.	false
technologies_long_description_wh_dlc07_tech_brt_heraldry_artois	The forested realm of Artois has notable significance in Bretonnia’s history – it was the location of the first Gathering of the Companions, where the fourteen newly-united dukedoms were first legitimised. Emblazoned on the Heraldry of Artois is the head of the monstrous boar Morthanok, symbol of Lord Folgar, the first Duke of Artois. A renowned hunter and lancer, Folgar's skills made him an invaluable Companion Knight who fought in several Great Battles alongside Gilles le Breton. Morthanok’s image is a reminder of the inaugural feast of the Companions, for which Folgar hunted down and slew the dangerous beast.	false
technologies_long_description_wh_dlc07_tech_brt_heraldry_bastonne	Prior to the Lady appearing before the Uniter and his fellow Grail Knights, the young Gilles rode out to cleanse his homeland Bastonne of the foul beasts wreaking havoc there. After slaying one such beast – the ancient Dragon Smearghus – he not only adopted its image on his Heraldry, but also wore its skin as part of his armour during all his Great Battles. To this day, the beast’s image and its pelt are revered in Bastonne, with the armour still kept and worn by the duke ceremoniously as well as in warfare.	false

Those residing on the coastlines assert that the Lady’s domain ends where the water turns salt – where the domain of Manann begins. The tempestuous Sea God’s tri-forked symbol is a reminder of the bond he forged with the bloodline of the Bordelen dukes, during the Tenth Great Battle, against the sea-raiders from the North. Lord Marcus, the first Duke of Bordeleaux, was said to have fought alongside Manann himself that day, ending the battle by challenging and defeating the giant warrior in command of the Norscans that day.	false
technologies_long_description_wh_dlc07_tech_brt_heraldry_bretonnia	King Leoncoeur's homeland of Couronne currently flies the heraldry of Bretonnia. The heritage of Couronne’s dukedom has ties to the original Grail Companions of Gilles the Uniter – their first duke was the heroic Carleond, saviour of the city and older brother of the most devoted Companion of them all, Thierulf of Lyonesse. As children, the two brothers were said to have miraculously slain a great lion together, which is why the heraldries of Lyonesse and Couronne – and hence, the heraldry of Bretonnia – display a lion’s image.	false
technologies_long_description_wh_dlc07_tech_brt_heraldry_carcassonne	It was Duke Lambard of Carcassonne, one of the famed Companions of Gilles the Uniter, who first adopted the image of the sword for his nation’s Heraldry. Although Carcassonne was one of few Bretonnian provinces that did not see a Great Battle on its lands, Lambard rode out to fight victoriously in nine of them. The blade symbolises Carcassonne’s warrior-culture, attested by their centuries-old tradition of gifting every newborn son a freshly-forged sword, which they are made to touch as soon as they enter the world. It is then ornamentally placed above their cots until it can be wielded.	false

He would later be one of the two Companions blessed by the Lady alongside Gilles himself, going on to fight victoriously in all twelve of the Great Battles with him.

This Heraldry was adopted by Lord Agilgar, first Duke of Parravon and one of the famed Companions of Gilles the Uniter. It is said to be a likeness of his winged steed Glorfinial, lord and sire of all Royal pegasi, whom he befriended. It was atop his friend Glorfinial that Agilgar was carried into the Fifth Great Battle – the liberation of Parravon – paving his way to Companionhood by his actions that day.	false
technologies_long_description_wh_dlc07_tech_brt_heraldry_start	Bretonnia is renowned as a land with a code of conduct that must be followed by all those with noble blood. The code is not just about a Knight’s behaviour – although that is also important – but also about the choices he makes during his exploits. Living for the moment, a Knight should always choose the most honourable course of action. To them, what matters is what they do now, not what they may or may not do in the future. It is often as simple as seeking battle as a way of securing personal honour and pride.	false
technologies_long_description_wh_dlc07_tech_brt_heraldry_unification	When the fourteen standards of Bretonnia come together, it is one of the most majestic displays of unity in the Old World. Gilles le Breton could not have achieved the unification of the Kingdom without the divine Blessing of the Lady and the other Companions, the first dukes of Bretonnia. When the greatest Knights across the fourteen Dukedoms come together to fight as one, as they did on the day of the final Great Battle, it is truly a sight to behold. It is an inspiring show of solidarity, earning respect of both men and Dwarfs alike.	false
technologies_long_description_wh_dlc08_tech_nor_creatures_01	The wastes of the north are home to beasts that would give soft southerners bed-wetting nightmares. Only the strongest creatures survive in this harsh environment, and there is no room for weakness. Kill or be killed is the law of the north, from the greatest mammoth thundering across the tundra to the smallest blood-sucking parasite oozing across the cold ground in search of warm blood. Many creatures have been warped by proximity to the Realm of Chaos, making them more fearsome still. To hunt the fierce beasts of the north, to overcome and slay them, is both grim sport and an offering to the Dark Gods, for the Ruinous Powers revel in all slaughter, be it of man or monster.	false
technologies_long_description_wh_dlc08_tech_nor_creatures_02	The northlands exist in the shadow of terrible energies. When the world was young, mysterious beings known only as the Old Ones sited a gateway to the stars above the world's poles. Unknown to them this portal drew other, less benevolent entities, now worshipped as the Dark Gods. A cataclysm occurred, unseen by mortal eyes, and the gateway was destroyed. But not entirely. There remains, in the farthest north, a place where all reason, all life, breaks down: the Realm of Chaos. Those strong enough to serve its fickle rulers and endure the changes it carves into living flesh share a fraction of that unearthly power, and those best suited to do so are monstrous creatures who know no other Gods and have always called the northlands home.	false
technologies_long_description_wh_dlc08_tech_nor_creatures_03	For those monsters of the north who have always basked in the terrible energies emanating from the Realm of Chaos, its dark strength comes to flow through them, enlivening their flesh even as it warps and twists it, making them faster and fiercer still. Such unnaturally enhanced abominations are more than willing to join the fight to spread the domain of the Ruinous Powers across the world; they make eager recruits to an army that seeks to bring death and destruction to all who oppose it.	false
technologies_long_description_wh_dlc08_tech_nor_creatures_04	Blood is the offering the Gods crave most, blood shed in their names. For creatures that live to hunt and rend and devour, blood is an intoxicant, and if they revel in it freely they reach new heights of frenzied aggression. When the wolf and the hound smell the metallic tang of blood, few can stand in their way, and they will follow the scent with mindless frenzy until the chase is done, and they sink their fangs into the flesh of their prey.	false
technologies_long_description_wh_dlc08_tech_nor_creatures_05	When the Old Ones' northern polar gateway collapsed, and the Realm of Chaos broke through, some of the arcane structures of the gates themselves intruded into the mortal realm. Star-Metal rained down and Warpstone, the lethal substance that is magic and change made manifest, came into being. A massive accretion of Warpstone formed in the sky, and became a sickly-green, weird moon, which men have named Morrslieb. Certain creatures of the north feel drawn to this corrupted moon, and when these sharp-toothed hunters bay at it, raising their heads to give blood-curdling howls in its baleful light, they feel its energy course through their flesh and sinews, urging them to greater ferocity and destruction in the name of the Dark Gods.	false
technologies_long_description_wh_dlc08_tech_nor_creatures_06	Though the hunter's skills are not the same as the warrior's, they have much in common, and their final aim, that of spilling blood, is shared. The Gods accept the offering of bestial blood almost as eagerly as that which flows from thinking foes – especially when the beast in question is a fearsome monster such as a Manticore or Chaos Frost Dragon. To hunt a beast, it is necessary to know that beast, its environment, behaviour, diet, etc. After all, you wouldn't want to find yourself facing a most problematic target on unfamiliar, awkward terrain and be at the top of the menu to boot, would you? Therefore, the study of the vicious and twisted creatures of the northern wastes is vital for any who dare stalk them.	false
technologies_long_description_wh_dlc08_tech_nor_creatures_07	For a master hunter, knowledge of his prey is not enough. Yes, he knows its ways - where it rests, what it feeds on, what its defences are - but more than that he must learn how the creatures he would stalk and kill see the world, to come to know what they fear and how they will react to being hunted. All weaknesses are uncovered, all behaviours understood. Only then does the true hunter, who makes all the world his prey, walk though the wilds with confidence, certain that whatever monsters or wild beasts he may encounter, he can overcome and slay them, and dedicate their deaths to the Ruinous Powers.	false
technologies_long_description_wh_dlc08_tech_nor_marauders_01	With blades in their hands, the tribes of the north are unstoppable. Every sinew cleaved, every head taken, every enemy gutted, increases the glory of the Dark Gods. Yet swords do not wash ashore like driftwood, and axes are not found under stones. In order to arm the vicious warriors of the north, an army of smiths forge a mountain of weapons, their blades sharp and unbreakable and ready to be put to the bloody work required by the Ruinous Powers. The best tools forge the best weapons, and with a ready supply of well-crafted weaponry the Northmen grow ever more powerful.	false
technologies_long_description_wh_dlc08_tech_nor_marauders_02	Even among those who live for slaughter, armour has its place. A warrior who can survive the slash of an enemy's blade or the blow of their hammer lives to fight another day, and earns more chances to  offer up the lifeblood of his enemies to the Gods. Armour that does not dent or split or buckle must be well-made, and well-made armour needs solid and carefully-crafted anvils. A Marauder whose armour is fashioned with skill wades through the enemy without being distracted by his foes' attempts to wound him - for he is the one doing the wounding!	false
technologies_long_description_wh_dlc08_tech_nor_marauders_03	A warrior is only as good as his blade. The metal is heated and hammered and tempered by skilled craftsmen to form swords that slash bellies open like wineskins and axes that hack limbs from bodies with a single blow. For the bloodthirsty warriors of the north a blade exists to spill blood to honour the Dark Gods, and those unspeakably alien deities accept no excuses when it comes to killing in their names. Only the strongest hammer, solid and even-hitting each time it strikes the malleable metal, forges blades fit for Marauders whose greatest joy is the destruction of their enemies.	false
technologies_long_description_wh_dlc08_tech_nor_marauders_04	With a good throwing axe, a warrior can split an enemy's skull from two dozen paces. The more throwing axes a Marauder carries, the more lives he can take for the Dark Gods, mowing down enemies before they get close enough to strike him. A good axe has an edge that parts flesh with ease, and a good edge requires work with a sharpening stone. Using such stones, sharper axes are produced with greater speed, giving warriors an advantage from afar, and more opportunities to cut down all who stand against them, dismembering their foes in praise of the Ruinous Powers.	false
technologies_long_description_wh_dlc08_tech_nor_marauders_05	As for a warrior, so for his steed. When a Marauder lays into his foes, his armour lets him absorb their blows and strike back without distraction. When he rides into battle, his mount must have similar protection, lest the enemy cut the beast out from under him. Covering the mount's vitals with barding protects it, so the ruthless warrior riding on its back or in the chariot behind may strike deeper into enemy lines, cutting down and trampling all who stand in his way, the better to soak the land in their blood to glorify the Gods.	false
technologies_long_description_wh_dlc08_tech_nor_marauders_06	A mounted warrior has many advantages: greater speed to rush into battle, greater height to strike from, and the brute power of his mount, making him able to chase down and trample more enemies. But for the mount to be effective they must be shod, hooves hardened and protected with metal shoes that in their turn increase the steed's ability to inflict damage on those they run down. A badly-fitted shoe can be the undoing of a rider, ending their chance to bring glory and bloodshed for the Gods before the fight has even begun. A well-fitted shoe requires the right tools, wielded by experts.	false
technologies_long_description_wh_dlc08_tech_nor_marauders_07	There is more than one use for a captured foe. Though the altars of the shrines are ever thirsty for more blood to be spilled on them, those captives fit and strong enough are put to a different purpose. Crudely armed, they are then used for sparring, or target, practice. For the savage, hardened warriors who inhabit the northern wastes, this is sport and pleasure in one, and may even increase a warrior's skill, before they tire of the inferior opponents and go looking for something more ... substantial to fight. And in the unlikely event captives are not killed during the practice, they can always be sacrificed to the Gods later.	false

technologies_long_description_wh_dlc08_tech_nor_other_02	A ship is only as good as its hull. A longer, larger ship hull is more stable in the water, less liable to fall prey to the gales and currents of the open sea. And the larger the ship, the more can be carried. This means more warriors travel on each ship, eager to make landfall and get to the business of despoilment and pillage. Larger ships means more supplies can be carried too, and so the armies of the north roam farther afield to find new lands to raid and ravage in the name of the Ruinous Powers.	false
technologies_long_description_wh_dlc08_tech_nor_other_03	For the Northmen, sailing a longship is a means to an end. They take to the seas to raid, to bring death and destruction in the name of the Dark Gods and to steal as much plunder as they can carry. The northerners are in a hurry to reach new shores ripe for reiving as soon as possible and for a ship with sails that belly like the gut of an overweight Dwarf, distance is no challenge. The longship cuts through the water, speeding on to the next destination, the next chance to spill blood and bring ever greater glory to the  Gods.	false

A mere whim of the weather will not stand in the way of the Marauders' manic drive to bring devastation and bloodshed to every shore. If they must, then even hardened warriors take to the oars and bend their own strength to drive the longship forward. With oars made strong and long the lack of wind barely slows the ship - and the hulking warriors who pull on the oars grow stronger and hardier still, making them even more ready for the coming battles.	false

Northern Marauders guffaw at facing foes who would rather sing or talk or pray than fight - and then remove their heads to take as trophies.

The coin accumulated by the rich merchants and mercenary captains of Tilea buy materials for building settlements and useful equipment for battle, for not all weapons of war can be forged or pillaged. The settlements themselves, once occupied, are used to grow the armies of the north. The men of Tilea are also renowned for their ideas. Much of this pointless noodling makes little sense to one whose life is devoted to combat, bloodshed and the worship of the Dark Gods, but they also have knowledge of war and tactics of use to the north, and in turn this knowledge will further the Dark Gods' cause.	false

The armies of the north winkle them out of their holds and underground fastnesses, and the resulting battles bring fierce joy to even the most jaded Marauder.

The Necromantic secrets of the Vampire Counts of Sylvania, once revealed, are turned to serve the cause of the Dark Gods.

They claim to be great warriors but have grown soft, and become obsessed with matters the Northman have no time for, such as 'taxes' and 'elections'. They argue about which of their dead heroes should serve as a God but when the armies of the north sweep down upon them the argument ends in slaughter, as their screams and violent deaths become a sacrifice to the only powers that matter.	false

The northern tribes are used to wild magic, but the staid practices of magicians in the south can still be put to the service of the Dark Gods. The arms and armour of the Empire's warriors are turned against those who made them, and their cities and castles never hold out long against the might of the north.	false
technologies_long_description_wh_dlc08_tech_nor_other_16	The time has come for those who have lived too long to finally meet their end. The Vampire Counts are proud and arrogant, and think themselves immune to the final death, but they are learning otherwise. Mortals fear warped magic and Vampiric corruption but these Unliving abominations do not frighten warriors bathed in the currents of Chaotic magic and chosen as agents of the Dark Gods. The Vampire Counts say they want blood, and live to take it, but their own immortal blood makes a glorious and lasting offering to the Ruinous Powers.	false
technologies_long_description_wh_dlc08_tech_nor_other_17	Though the Vampire Counts have little in the way of plunder, their arcane knowledge may still serve the Ruinous Powers. They understand the ways of preserving and using the dead, and of raising armies that do not tire or falter, mindless warriors who will not stop until hacked into useless lumps of decaying flesh. Their lore also honours the Skin Wolves, and that knowledge is of use when dealing with the were creatures who lend their claws and fangs to the fight, and travel with the armies of the north. 	false
technologies_long_description_wh_dlc08_tech_nor_other_18	The Greenskin tribes embrace all forms of violence and love to ravage across the 'civilised' lands if they can stop fighting each other for long enough. It is a lifestyle the tribes of the north understand, but that does not stop the northern armies raiding deep into the south to fight the Orcs and Goblins on their own territory. The depravations of the barren 'Badlands' pose no problem for those used to the pitiless and freezing wastes of the north, and the battle is a bloody clash against cunning and vicious opponents. Though the Greenskins do not bleed as men do, their deaths still please the Ruinous Powers.	false
technologies_long_description_wh_dlc08_tech_nor_other_19	The Greenskins are foul and base creatures, but they see the world in terms the northern tribes understand: for each, the only way of life is to fight until there are no more foes left to kill. The Orcs and Goblins have gathered some useful loot, which the men and Trolls of the north are happy to claim. And the Greenskins are creatures of magic; their magic energises the northern armies, helping them feed the vile appetites of the Dark Gods by bringing ever-greater slaughter. Waaagh!	false

technologies_long_description_wh_main_tech_chs_branch_1_1	There are signs and portents that the tribes have long learned to identify. When women start weeping blood, when mutations increase and the call of the Manticore is heard over the wind - these are the signs that the Chaos Gods have cast their eyes and that eternal war is at hand. And so the Marauders gather in large numbers, awaiting a "Three-eyed King".	false
technologies_long_description_wh_main_tech_chs_branch_1_2	Within the Brass Citadel sits Khorne atop a mountain of skulls, each one cleaved from their host in the Blood God's name. This pleases him greatly, for the taller his throne, the higher the death toll, the greater the chaos unleashed. He may even reward those that collect the most with some token gesture or gift, be it a smouldering hide or even a brass collar - such are the ways of the Gods.	false
technologies_long_description_wh_main_tech_chs_branch_1_3	Once the sacking of a settlement has begun, the correct rituals will not only ensure the place is truly despoiled but also that the Dark Gods themselves see the discord and ruination, be pleased, and look fondly upon their agents. Of course, attracting the attention of the Chaos Gods is not always the best option, for they are fickle, but those who tread the Path to Ruination are clearly not averse to risk.	false
technologies_long_description_wh_main_tech_chs_branch_2_1	The Norse, amongst other Marauder tribes, daub their ragged banners with the shapes and runes of their Gods. Crows and serpents are common sigils, along with skulls and the all-consuming Chaos Star. Then there are the marks that give the true names of the Dark Gods; such runes are not meant for mortal eyes.	false
technologies_long_description_wh_main_tech_chs_branch_2_2	No Marauder Chieftain is elevated to power out of privilege alone. Should the Dark Gods be looking, he will garner the most attention, so must fight for the right to lead. This is why a weak leader will not be tolerated and quickly be challenged to bloody combat. So it has always been amongst the Northmen. 	false
technologies_long_description_wh_main_tech_chs_branch_2_3	The weak will be culled. For the Northmen, this is as much an absolute truth as the motion of the tides. If a man grows to adulthood without showing a thirst for violence he is likely to be exiled or simply killed. Even those that make it to the raiding parties will be mercilessly left to die if they stumble or fail to keep up; it is merely the act of cutting off a septic limb, lest the host be weakened.	false
technologies_long_description_wh_main_tech_chs_branch_2_4	Glorifying acts, those that praise the Chaos Gods, may lead to the granting of great favour. A tribute can be simple; a pile of victims' skulls in adulation of Khorne or the daubing of a desecrated temple with the runes of Tzeentch. Whatever the act, the monument itself does not matter as much as the sentiment intended.	false
technologies_long_description_wh_main_tech_chs_branch_3_1	Dark standards, made in the far north or taken as trophies from campaigns past, are then changed and corrupted by Chaos. What was once the grand heraldry of the southern lands is daubed with the dread symbols of Chaos; withering runes that refuse to remain still even as they are being scrawled.	false
technologies_long_description_wh_main_tech_chs_branch_3_2	There are many mortals who vie for even a flicker of the Chaos Gods' attention. Most will be ignored or simply fall by the wayside as another damned soul, but those that aspire to true greatness - they who rise above the ranks of the indeterminate to be chosen - are inexorably linked by fate to the Dark Powers for evermore.	false
technologies_long_description_wh_main_tech_chs_branch_3_3	A special gift for the Forsaken, given freely by the Chaos Gods to their most devout of children.

technologies_long_description_wh_main_tech_chs_branch_3_4	Chaos Warriors may once have been of men, but donning Chaos Armour has changed them both in body and mind. The touch of a Dark God has denoted them as Warriors for their patron, marked among his possessions. The God, in turn, may gift his chosen ones with a fighting prowess beyond that of normal men so as not to appear lacklustre on the battlefield. 	false
technologies_long_description_wh_main_tech_chs_branch_3_5	Those that shout the Blood God's infamous war cry should expect his attention, even if for the briefest of moments.

technologies_long_description_wh_main_tech_chs_branch_4_1	Whether held aloft by plodding infantry or in the arms of a Chaos Knight on hellish steed, the banners and pennants of Chaos mark the regiments that carry them as servants to the Ruinous Powers.

technologies_long_description_wh_main_tech_chs_branch_4_2	The Eye of the Gods is constantly roving to find great champions, diabolical souls or simply mass carnage to cause amusement.

technologies_long_description_wh_main_tech_chs_branch_4_3	The Slaves to Darkness are those most committed to the ruination of the mortal realm.

It is not for nothing that the Chosen are so called, as it takes a special, extremely twisted being to serve the Gods with such fervour.	false
technologies_long_description_wh_main_tech_chs_branch_4_4	Chaos Armour is a gift from the Gods, an arcane suit of full-plate that is difficult to penetrate with conventional weapons. Yet as blasphemous as it may seem, it can be further improved upon. By inscribing the litanies of hate found in the Liber Malefic, the armour is hardened even more.	false
technologies_long_description_wh_main_tech_chs_branch_4_5	Despite their immortal status, with time being a mere concept to the Chaos Gods, they still grow impatient - willing their followers on to bring about the world's destruction at a quicker pace. Frustrated with the tardiness of their armies, they see fit to gift their servants the ability to march for far longer than their foes.	false
technologies_long_description_wh_main_tech_chs_branch_5_1	The world cannot be conquered through close combat alone, despite Khorne's ceaseless demands. As mortal foes use artillery and exotic beasts, then so must the Chaos hordes. The Hellcannons must speak more often, and the Giants of Chaos have swollen muscles. That is what the Ruinous Powers demand, and so it shall be!	false
technologies_long_description_wh_main_tech_chs_branch_5_2	Daemonic Armour is forged within the Realm of Chaos and imbued with Daemon essence. Runes of a Daemon's name are inscribed, binding the magical creature to it and heightening the protective qualities of the plate.

technologies_long_description_wh_main_tech_dwf_civ_1_0	Dwarf treasuries are as famous as their beards - vaults stocked high with coin and gold collected as tribute from outposts, Clans, and Guilds in the area of the Karak's influence. Such fame has been to the race's detriment, as Greenskins and other filth have raided the deeps in search of Dwarf treasure as a result!	false
technologies_long_description_wh_main_tech_dwf_civ_1_1	There are many abandoned outposts, mines and other Khazids in the Karaz Ankor - settlements that are no longer sustainable due to raids, invasion or for simply existing during the Time of Woes. However, as the Dwarf kingdoms expand again, expeditions are sent out with large subsidies from the local king or the Guilds to make these places secure and viable again.	false
technologies_long_description_wh_main_tech_dwf_civ_1_3	The Guilds, much like the Clans, are run by highly-placed families, often of Royal blood or able to trace back their lineage back to the very first Guild Master. The hiring of siblings, sires, cousins, and lesser kin is seen as a "good thing" in Dwarf society, for a family may uphold its honour by being highly capable in its chosen field.	false
technologies_long_description_wh_main_tech_dwf_civ_1_4	Dwarfs have a grim outlook on life and rarely waste words on meaningless platitudes and empty gestures. They see these behaviours in others and detest it. Dwarfs say it as they see it, which can make already-delicate negotiations… somewhat tricky. However, there are Dwarfs that can play political games who are known as "azril-tongued", for they make the best messengers and diplomats.	false
technologies_long_description_wh_main_tech_dwf_civ_2_0	The Toolmakers' Guild is only a few centuries old, which makes it an infant organisation compared to some of the ancient, venerable Guilds, yet its rise in power and influence has been meteoric and uncomfortable according to some Longbeards. The Guild's greatest play was securing a Royal Decree stating that even if a journeyman makes his own tools, he must still pay tribute to the Guild.	false
technologies_long_description_wh_main_tech_dwf_civ_2_1	Tools - and quite a few weapons beside - can be found at the tool market. Of course, no knowledgeable customer pays the marked price, and Dwarf haggling is notoriously straightforward, being of the "I want this, I'll pay you this and not a copper more." variety, the vendor then following up with a "wazzock" grumbled underneath his beard.	false
technologies_long_description_wh_main_tech_dwf_civ_2_2	The relationship between the Guilds and the Clans, especially the Royal Clans, is complex. Most of the time they work in unity, although war between Guild and Clan is not unknown. Thorgrim takes a dim view of such things, stating there are more than enough urks out there for Dawi to be slaying. Still, when a Thane speaks he does so, in theory, with the power of his Lord and king.	false
technologies_long_description_wh_main_tech_dwf_civ_2_3	Although no Dawi would state it - as to challenge another Dwarf openly would question his honour and infer insult and cause a grudge to be recorded in a Guild's own Book of Grudges - the Clans do scrutinise Guilds and their powerful leaders. They do this not just out of rivalry, as most Clan members belong to a Guild as well, but to ensure they are competently run as the backbone of industry.	false
technologies_long_description_wh_main_tech_dwf_civ_2_4	After several hundred years of being around manlings and elgi, Dwarf diplomats can become emissaries and ambassadors, using a tolerance built up over decades to bite their tongues and match wits with the snarkiest of the beardless scum. In this way, they serve the Karaz Ankor by brokering alliances and treaties. Other Dwarfs look upon this occupation with disdain, ignorant to how many Dawi lives have been saved through carefully-brokered peace treaties.	false
technologies_long_description_wh_main_tech_dwf_civ_3_0	Dwarfs don't just store gold and gems in their vaults. Half the space will be used to store the supplies necessary for the Dawi to hold out during a siege. So, casks of ale (obviously), loaves and loaves of stone bread (which can last decades before going stale), grain, arms, armour, and even some livestock will be taken from mountain pastures and set up in rudimentary pens as the enemy approaches.	false
technologies_long_description_wh_main_tech_dwf_civ_3_1	Quernstones of Dwarf origin are the only tools that can grind the flour needed for stone bread, as the meal used is a mixture of ground stone and grain. They are also used for grinding the base minerals used in black powder and often the same pair of grinding stones will be used for both tasks on the same day, lending the next day's stone bread a peppery taste appreciated by the Longbeards.	false
technologies_long_description_wh_main_tech_dwf_civ_3_2	While much of the Underway remains in ruin or under control of the grobi, over the last few centuries Grudgebearer has spent considerable resources to make the ancient underground Dwarf roads usable again. This way, the Guilds can freely treat with each other in relative secrecy and prevent manling bandits from attacking. Sadly, it doesn't always stop the grobi and thaggoraki.	false
technologies_long_description_wh_main_tech_dwf_civ_3_3	The influence a High King has on the Holds waxes and wanes depending on the ruler in question. Thorgrim is very much a traditionalist in that he expects each Karak to pay tribute to Karaz-a-Karak, but otherwise lets them govern themselves. However, should a Hold join his call to arms in the Age of Reckoning, then all power to them! Therefore, in recognising their independence, Grudgebearer makes the Karaz Ankor all the more united.	false
technologies_long_description_wh_main_tech_dwf_civ_3_4	To Dwarfs, an oath is as unbreakable as the mountains themselves. Whether for Clan or Guild, a Dwarf's oath is his honour and that of all his Ancestors going back to the very start of his family. To break it would be to his eternal shame, for which self-expulsion or the Slayer Oath may be the only option.	false
technologies_long_description_wh_main_tech_dwf_civ_4_0	Powdermakers shun the perceived Dwarf wisdom that tradition has already created the best that could possibly be. Their Guild aligns itself more closely with the faction in the Engineers' Guild that embraces innovation. To this end, they are always refining their formulation - changing the weighting of different elements to increase charge or explosive power.	false
technologies_long_description_wh_main_tech_dwf_civ_4_1	Star-iron or Gromril, as it is known in Khazalid, is a rare metal that only the Dwarfen smiths can work. They fashion it into weapons and suits of the hardest armour. To release it from the mountain's grasp in the first place, the miners need tools of Gromril, because even the strongest steel mattocks and drill bits just break upon it.	false
technologies_long_description_wh_main_tech_dwf_civ_4_2	As well as resolving grudges between Dawi, Reckoners account for lost coin, tributes and tithes, for the Hold's king is entitle to his cut of any transaction in his realm. He, in turn, will offer tribute to the High King, and so the finances of the Karaz Ankor turn and the Dawi continue to fund their expansion and resurgence.	false
technologies_long_description_wh_main_tech_dwf_civ_4_4	The High King is rarely troubled by his own kith and kin, yet there have been times in the past when grumbles have turned from being merely sour and scathing to full-blown insurrection. Thorgrim does not tolerate such behaviour. In the throne chamber of Everpeak, a stern glance from him is enough to shut even the staunchest naysayer up.	false
technologies_long_description_wh_main_tech_dwf_civ_5_0	Boring or chipping away the rock bed at the bottom of freshly-sunk mineshafts are the steam drills, a recent arrival from the Engineers' Guild. These cacophonous contraptions have sped up digging times, but can only range as far as the thick pipes which carry the water needed to create the steam allow. This drawback hasn't stopped the Clans requesting drills for battle and investigating new ways to weaponize such technology.	false
technologies_long_description_wh_main_tech_dwf_civ_5_1	Dwarfs dig ever deeper, seeking out wealthy new seams of ore and gems. It is the prospectors they turn to when a fresh seam is needed. Many rely on their gut instinct, but others have started using Guild-supplied gadgets to filter the earth and give clues about where to sink the next shaft.	false
technologies_long_description_wh_main_tech_dwf_civ_5_2	An indolent Dwarf is a rare thing. By and large they are an industrious folk, that when contracted to do a job will get to it pronto. Dwarfs on construction duty, be they stone masons, builders, overseers et al, work in an impressive and ant-like parity; each Dwarf has a job and they will perform it to the best of their ability, as honour demands. 	false
technologies_long_description_wh_main_tech_dwf_civ_5_3	The Dwarf gods are their Ancestors, actual beings that strode the mountain chains, created the first master runes, founded Karaz-a-Karak and made war with the Chaos Gods. All Royal Clans, and even many Guilds, can trace their lineage back to the Ancestor Gods or their progeny, their remains found in sacred tombs deep within the oldest Karaks.	false
technologies_long_description_wh_main_tech_dwf_civ_5_4	The creation of Sealstones has been lost. The knowledge died with a Runelord several centuries past, yet there are a few older tombs in the lower deeps that remain sealed by the protective wards the Sealstones are laced with. Even in lost Dwarfholds there are revered tombs that remain untouched by enemy hands, as the Sealstones keep evil away.	false
technologies_long_description_wh_main_tech_dwf_civ_6_0	Even since men began fashioning their own metalwork, they have tried to copy Dawi methods using inferior materials. These things are inevitably shoddy works or 'Umgak', to use the Khazalid. To distinguish Dwarfen products made within the Karaz Ankor from manling reproductions, the Guilds have taken to attaching Guild tokens or 'Grims' to their work. Whether it's an ale cask or even Dwarf cut gems, a grim is a sign of quality.	false
technologies_long_description_wh_main_tech_dwf_civ_6_1	Certain goods spoil more easily than others, especially when water is introduced. There is no such thing as soggy stone bread - that stuff just won't get wet, which explains why manlings moan about its dryness and insist on slavering it in butter. However, even Dwarfs realise that salt and cinnabar cannot be transported when wet and so seal it in a mixture of tar and treated hides.	false
technologies_long_description_wh_main_tech_dwf_civ_6_2	The stone masons, the scaffolders, the tunnellers, the carpenters; Construction Guilds make up the majority of larger civic organisations within the Karaz Ankor. This makes them a powerful faction within inter-Guild politics and even gives them significant clout against the Clans and some kings. However, having them on-side guarantees any building project a boost.	false
technologies_long_description_wh_main_tech_dwf_civ_6_3	Dwarfs don't always like to flaunt their wealth, preferring to keep it locked up in deep vaults. However, the Kings of old learned that to impress both allies and rivals' emissaries, an impressive throne room is needed. No Hold wants to be known for its humble audience chamber, so the kings try to outdo each other with exquisitely carved stone thrones, flanked by grim statues of the Ancestor Gods.	false
technologies_long_description_wh_main_tech_dwf_civ_6_4	The iterant Runepriests are the keepers of the Ancestor Gods' bloodlines. They are able to recite the names of every generation going all the way back to the Ancestor Gods themselves. This is sacred knowledge, and powerful wisdom to boot, as from it comes the Protection of Valaya. However, like their kin, the Runesmiths, Runepriests can go years without finding a worthy apprentice, and some die without passing on their holy lore.	false
technologies_long_description_wh_main_tech_dwf_civ_7_0	A Guild's controlling council meets in the Guild hall. The location depends on where it is principally located. The Engineers' shrine and Guild halls are in Zhufbar, for example, although most of the larger Guilds have their own halls in all major Karaks. The inner workings of the Guilds remain clandestine - all manner of secret handshakes, passwords and unusual rituals are needed to gain entry!	false
technologies_long_description_wh_main_tech_dwf_civ_7_1	When led by the powerful Engineers' Guild, there is no seam, or resource that cannot be reached. In the past, all manner of platforms, steam drills, hydro-belt conveyances and alcohol-powered engines were used to excavate valuables from deep under the ground. As the Dawi saying goes: "If it's in the bloody ground, then it's ours!" Perhaps there's a bit more poetry to it when heard in the original Khazalid?	false
technologies_long_description_wh_main_tech_dwf_civ_7_2	The Runepriests, through their ancient knowledge of the Ancestor Gods - their works and gifts to the Dawi kin - are able to bless great endeavours that would please their patron ancestors. So it is that Grungni, the Great Maker, confers his favour on the Guilds, ensuring wealth for their members as the true artisans of all Dawi.	false
technologies_long_description_wh_main_tech_dwf_civ_7_4	Feeling at home – as they do – in the dark, dank tunnels beneath the surface of the Old World, it was only a matter of time before Dwarfs and Skaven clashed. Whereas the Dwarfen race, although grim and bad-tempered, are essentially a force for order, the Skaven are a thoroughly evil, scheming, nefarious bunch of ratmen, who act accordingly at every given opportunity. Once the ever-enterprising Dwarfs became aware of the Skaven presence beneath their Holds, they immediately got their heads together to come up with ways of beguiling, confounding, and – usually and ideally – killing the despicable ratmen stone dead as efficiently as possible. As such, Dwarf Engineers and Powder Masters have developed a number of substances that, although harmless if ingested by Dawi, are fast-acting and very effective when introduced to Skaven bloodstreams. The method of delivery varies between lobbing canisters of the stuff at enemy lines to carefully lacing water supplies and known feeding spots where ravenous Skaven feeling the Black Hunger gather; the results speak for themselves…	false

technologies_long_description_wh_main_tech_dwf_mil_1_0	Most Dwarfs belong to a Guild and a Clan. When war calls, a Dwarf will put down his tools, don his armour and pick up his axe, joining a Clan regiment and, if needs be, beginning practice drills. It doesn't take long for Dwarfs to lock shields and lash out with axes in a co-ordinated strike, for it is in their blood and they have no doubt been fighting since before they had whiskers.	false
technologies_long_description_wh_main_tech_dwf_mil_1_1	When the horns of war sound throughout the Dwarfhold, the throngs will gather. The Clans form up into their own groups, proudly showing their colours and runes. The Guilds are duty-bound to release their folk to defend the Hold or the king's honour, or even settle a grudge. And so they march forth or seal the gates and await the foe.	false
technologies_long_description_wh_main_tech_dwf_mil_1_3	Dwarfs are an honourable race, but have no problems with the missile combat that makes the so-called "chivalrous" Bretonnians so queasy. To the Dwarfs, this is "silly umgi thinking". If the ancestors have given you the ingenuity to create weapons that fly far and strike with lethal accuracy, then you'd be foolish not to use them, no? Thunderers and Quarrellers are particularly good at operating their chosen weapons.	false
technologies_long_description_wh_main_tech_dwf_mil_1_4	While the crossbow as a weapon design has stood the test of time, younger members of the Engineers' Guild are always on a quest for perfection, even if that gets a grumble from the traditionalists. With Grudgebearer's blessing, they developed crossbows that dropped the wooden stock in favour of one made entirely from puresteel, which increases tension and accuracy.	false
technologies_long_description_wh_main_tech_dwf_mil_2_0	When the call to Clan is invoked, every Dawi must answer. They proudly yell out their Clan's many deeds and achievements, its heritage and all grudges still to be settled. Warriors and miners alike ready their weapons, desperate to seek and kill the urks!	false
technologies_long_description_wh_main_tech_dwf_mil_2_1	Dwarfs' stoic nature - their stubborn resolve - is as much part of them as their beards. Of course, there are a few - shameful - incidents scattered throughout history where Dwarf warriors have fled the battlefield, but such indecency among 'yellow-beards' is thankfully rare.	false
technologies_long_description_wh_main_tech_dwf_mil_2_2	The planting of Oath Stones in the midst of battle is a grand gesture. It is a grim message to the foe that the Thane or Lord stands ready to take on all-comers and that he will not shirk or run from a fight. With his oath and honour on the line, it is now up to the enemy to try and take it.	false
technologies_long_description_wh_main_tech_dwf_mil_2_3	Wagons have been traditionally pulled by mules. The poor beasts heft heavy wagons full of ammunition. However, recent innovations have seen more beastless wagons, powdered by alcohol engines. The mules still have a job for the foreseeable future though, as the engines have proven temperamental, and a fair few simply drive off cliffs and dash the valuable stock upon the mountainsides.	false
technologies_long_description_wh_main_tech_dwf_mil_2_4	Thunderous and Quarrellers have good eyes above and below the ground. Those who truly excel at shooting urks dead are formed into elite regiments renowned for their accuracy, firing shots that punch through the eye slits of a Chaos Warrior's armour or coolly bring a Bretonnian lance formation to a halt, bringing down the lead charger and watching as the remaining Knightly destriers trip, stumble and break formation.	false
technologies_long_description_wh_main_tech_dwf_mil_3_1	A Dwarfen shieldwall is an intimidating thing to face. The tactic extenuates a Dwarf's stocky, squat and strong build, allowing a formation of Dawi to effectively create a mobile fastness on the battlefield. As the enemy is repelled by a curtain wall of shields, axes will snap out to lop off limbs and heads. Dwarfs shield designs complement this strategy, allowing them to be locked quickly during battle.	false
technologies_long_description_wh_main_tech_dwf_mil_3_2	To increase his fighting prowess, a Dwarf Lord may be accompanied by loyal, strong and powerful retainers. These will be some of the Clan's best fighters and have lengthy, well-kept beards as denotes their status. Long before any battle, the faithful servants will make vows to Grimnir regarding the protection of their Lord, also making bets about how many each will slay in the forthcoming encounter.	false
technologies_long_description_wh_main_tech_dwf_mil_3_3	Dwarfs like to mark their targets and kill with one shot, making each bolt or bullet count. Still, encouraged by younger beardlings, they have realised that the umgi maybe onto something by filling the air with hot lead, so have started drilling and firing in volleys. This involves taking some misses on the chin, knowing that when it averages out, there'll be more urks dead than not.	false
technologies_long_description_wh_main_tech_dwf_mil_3_4	Clans buy black powder in bulk, which makes the Powdermakers' Guild increasingly wealthy. It also gives the Clans some power, as being such heavy users they can demand a better quality product and "not that same snuff you send to the Empire". Powdermakers oblige by constantly refining the formula, making it more lethal with each successive batch.	false
technologies_long_description_wh_main_tech_dwf_mil_4_0	A Longbeard unit in a battle line is likened to a reliable anchor bolt or bulwark that stands fast and supports other formations. Woe betide any beardlings that falter under the Longbeards' stern eyes, because they will be admonished within inches of their lives. For the breaded veterans, it is a point of pride - if you're going to do something, then do it properly, including death!	false
technologies_long_description_wh_main_tech_dwf_mil_4_1	An oath is a pact - a sworn promise that when needed then the Dwarfs will come. Only death can cheat them out of their obligation, so when a Lord calls upon his Longbeards to attend the grouchy veterans will dust off their armour, sharpen their already keen axes and come to make war.	false
technologies_long_description_wh_main_tech_dwf_mil_4_2	It is no coincidence that the Warhammer known as Skull-Splitter, or Ghal Maraz in Khazalid, the most venerated of manling weapons, was made by Dwarfen hands, for the Dawi are the greatest smiths in the world bar none. And while they excel at mass-producing weapons of fine quality, the bespoke axes and hammers, those master-crafted by the finest smiths, are the greatest of their kind to be found anywhere.	false
technologies_long_description_wh_main_tech_dwf_mil_4_4	Drakeguns and the other flaming weapons in the Dwarfen armoury use a secret formulation devised by the Engineers' Guild to power them. It is a war secret that the Dwarfs do not share with their umgi allies, partly because they don't want it to ever be used against them and partly because they simply don't trust manlings to use it sensibly. Even some of their younger peers have started tampering with the formula to make it even more volatile and dangerous!	false
technologies_long_description_wh_main_tech_dwf_mil_4_5	As befits their chosen roles as scouts, Rangers rarely join the main Dwarf battle lines, preferring instead to fight as ‘irregulars’, occasionally banding together to carry out a tricky operation, but happiest when engaged in solo actions against the foe. As such, they deal in sabotage and misdirection ahead of Dwarf throngs – something many of their kin consider to be sneaky and, well, just not the Dawi way. Regardless, Rangers poison enemy water supplies, cause rock-falls, lead savage, ravenous beasts into enemy camps – the list goes on. Of course, little more than a cursory acknowledgement of Rangers’ assistance is all that can be expected from most Dwarfs - after all there’s nothing so final as a straight-up fight face-to-face - but their Lords recognise the valuable contribution these brave, independent warriors make whenever they are called to fight for Clan and Hold.	false
technologies_long_description_wh_main_tech_dwf_mil_5_0	Dwarfs don't suffer liars or fools, unless in story-form. In refectories and feasting halls across their realm, once the night is under way and with the fire roaring, a veteran will light his pipe and tell of sagas past or stories of more recent events involving the veterans of that very Hold. Some stories are tall, others ribald, but many are true - in this way the Dwarfs' chronicle an oral history of their Holds' greatest warriors.	false
technologies_long_description_wh_main_tech_dwf_mil_5_1	Dwarfs have many different types of songs; ribald ones for telling after a good few tankards of Bugman's XXXXXX, but also choruses with more practical applications. Marching songs have many verses and a repetitive meter, so stepping in time to the chant quickens the Dwarfs' pace. For enemies, the sound of singing Dwarfs - with lyrics such as "hi-ho, its off to slay we go" - is a clarion call to escape or at least raise battle lines.	false
technologies_long_description_wh_main_tech_dwf_mil_5_2	While the majority of Dwarf-forged weapons do not bear a Runesmith's mark, those that do are highly-prized and scattered throughout the Karaz Ankor and beyond. For whole regiments to have rune-bearing weapons is rare, but not unheard of. If a Clan is rich enough they may be able to contract a willing Runesmith to ensorcel an entire armoury, but such a feat can take years.	false
technologies_long_description_wh_main_tech_dwf_mil_5_3	The Dwarf industrial machine, when in full flow, is impressive. The workshops and forges of the Engineers' Guild would make any umgi die of envy. These Hold smelteries use modularity for scale, allowing firing pins, cranks, cogs, barrels or carriages to be used on various war machines, ensuring that artillery pieces are produced at a cracking rate, as well as reducing storage and repair costs.	false
technologies_long_description_wh_main_tech_dwf_mil_5_4	The newest of ammunition types are large shells. A few modified cannons were used for testing and while the initial results were disastrous, later iterations have been very promising. Larger cannons are being developed for use with shells, as Clans closely aligned to the Engineers' Guild see great potential in siege scenarios.	false
technologies_long_description_wh_main_tech_dwf_mil_6_0	Ironbreakers guard a Karak's many under-surface entrances, gates that connect to the Underway and outlying mines further out from the main halls and deeps of the Hold. For this reason, the Ironbreakers are always in a state of readiness, always on duty as an attack can happen anytime, night or day - for the sun or moons do not shine beneath the mountains.	false
technologies_long_description_wh_main_tech_dwf_mil_6_1	Ironbreakers' and Irondrakes' primary duty is the protection of the deeps and gates that lead into a Dwarfhold from the Underway. These are experienced, capable warriors whose Gromril and rune-inscribed armour makes them a necessary expense. However, the so-called "Iron Price" is not the gold for outfitting and upkeep, but the cost to the Hold when these brave warriors are away fighting on a battlefield far from the deeps they are charged to protect.	false
technologies_long_description_wh_main_tech_dwf_mil_6_2	Dwarfs often excel in areas where the Empire seems merely competent. Dwarfen armour is the envy of both its foes and allies - they can produce well fitted, highly-articulated and lobstered plate that sits well on the sturdy frames of their kin. They can also do this at scale, fitting not just their Lords and champions, but whole regiments in tough Dwarf-forged steel.	false
technologies_long_description_wh_main_tech_dwf_mil_6_3	Master Engineers are not shut away in their workshops, many need to test improvements in their designs or simply wish to be out in the field of battle to put their targeting eyes to good use. When attached to war machines, they ensure their proper and continued use in the heat of the battle and also bark orders at the gun crew to increase firing rates.	false
technologies_long_description_wh_main_tech_dwf_mil_6_4	Assembly lines are still a relatively new phenomenon in the Karaz Ankor, again an innovation championed by the younger faction within the Engineers' Guild under the auspices of the High King. The Guild itself is loath to fund such "dangerous free thinking", so it has been left to the richer Clans who desire swifter production and reparation methods to fund the venture.	false
technologies_long_description_wh_main_tech_dwf_mil_7_0	To fight in the tunnels, leagues underground in the dark, is a harrowing experience, but not for the Ironbreakers and Irondrakes. To them, it is their sworn duty. The fights are brutal, for their foes - chiefly the thaggoraki and grobi - give no quarter and fight without honour. Any veteran of such battles is a warrior to have at your back, for he has survived horror that even other Dwarfs would find truly disturbing.	false
technologies_long_description_wh_main_tech_dwf_mil_7_1	The Iron Kin - the elite Dawi brotherhood that don Gromril armour to defend a Dwarfhold's deeps are a tough band of warriors, who see it as their sacred duty to stand guard no matter what. A Dwarf is only as good as his bond, and these warriors have some of the strongest among their race within their ranks.	false
technologies_long_description_wh_main_tech_dwf_mil_7_2	Ironbreakers have always been blessed with the greatest suits of Gromril Armour a Hold can provide. With the advent of the Irondrakes, these suits have been further improved with fresh runes woven into the metal, making them tougher still and able to resist high temperatures when the Drakegun is deployed.	false
technologies_long_description_wh_main_tech_dwf_mil_7_3	The Dwarfs learned long ago that such effective artillery draws the attention of the enemy, who are always desperate to silence Dwarfen firepower due to the high death toll it causes. The Dwarfs, in turn, know that to protect their prized assets they need to entrench machines or create bulwarks - defences that make it very difficult for the urks to attack good, honest, Dwarfen artillery.	false
technologies_long_description_wh_main_tech_dwf_mil_7_4	There is a lot of expertise needed to operate the Dwarfen war machines. Crew need to know not just how to reload cannons, but set firing arcs, detonation times, fuse lengths and, most importantly of all - if operating a flame cannon - monitoring pressure gauges. Occasionally, in-battle training is needed, but a wise Thane ensures his crew have plenty of practice in the Hold's testing chambers.	false
technologies_long_description_wh_main_tech_dwf_mil_8_0	As the most elite warriors, Hammerers enjoy a high status within their Holds. When not personally shielding their thane or king, they are tasked with guarding key elements such as the throne chamber or vital gates in the upper halls and the royal chambers themselves.	false
technologies_long_description_wh_main_tech_dwf_mil_8_1	Whether it is the High King reading from the Dammaz Kron itself or a Lord reciting grudges against the Clan or Hold, nothing can bring a Dwarf to anger quicker. Should the Hold's Book of Grudges be cracked open, word will travel fast and soon, the Clans gathering, desperate to join the throng and avenge the wrongs entered in the tome.	false
technologies_long_description_wh_main_tech_dwf_mil_8_3	Gyrocopters, while still a relatively recent invention, have been active for a while - enough time for most major Holds to establish aircorps and hollow out mountain peaks to create hangers. However, they are too fragile for many Dwarfs' liking. Collaborations with Runesmiths of late may have solved this issue, allowing the use of heavier armour yet remaining air-worthy.	false
technologies_long_description_wh_main_tech_dwf_mil_8_4	Gyrocopter engines have been constantly iterated ever since their first use. Early prototypes look positively crude now compared to the craft currently used by the largest aircorps. These engines have improved not only in speed, but lift capacity, allowing larger craft to be built. Rumours persist of even larger carrier-type aircraft being developed to transport entire fleets of Gyrocopters!	false
technologies_long_description_wh_main_tech_dwf_mil_9_0	A Slayer has no petty concerns for death, so will launch himself into the enemy with savage fury. The urks rarely encounter foes who have little care for their own well-being and generally find this vexing and difficult to deal with. The Slayers are no slouches and will strike out with axe and without fear, even when facing the toughest and largest of foes.	false
technologies_long_description_wh_main_tech_dwf_mil_9_1	Dwarfs are a proud people and none of them cope well with failure or personal tragedy. The loss of family, honour or hoard makes them inconsolable. In such dire circumstances they go in self-imposed exile, forsaking family and Clan and all possessions, save their axes. They take the Slayer Oath and seek repentance by seeking out their doom, fighting the largest and most dangerous monsters the world has to offer.	false
technologies_long_description_wh_main_tech_dwf_mil_9_2	The Runepriests' numbers thin each year, as their numbers shrink further. Yet they are still a respected, if increasingly rare, sight in many Holds. When they arrive at a Dwarfhold they always visit the Shrine of Grimnir to give thanks to the Warrior God and grant his favour to any other Dawi present who wishes it.	false
technologies_long_description_wh_main_tech_dwf_mil_9_3	Another fresh innovation from Field Engineers in the employ of the Clans locked in constant battle - for nothing forces innovation like a war - are pressure-regulating valves. These ensure maximum pressure can be retained to increase performance and range in steam and flame-spewing weaponry. They also release any excess pressure to prevent misfire or explosion, much to the relief of pilots and crew!	false

technologies_long_description_wh_main_tech_emp_barracks_1	Regimental sergeants in Elector Count armies are made of stern stuff. They are veterans of many battles and have probably seen things that would turn the stomachs of the average man. Such bravery sees them rise in the ranks, leading regiments and steeling their men when wavering or barking orders in the midst of battle. The Empire needs men like these, but the very nature of their occupation means they are rare souls indeed. 	false
technologies_long_description_wh_main_tech_emp_barracks_2	Some regimental standards are hundreds of years old - physical representations of their regiments, even as members join and die in battle, or - if they are lucky - are relieved of duty and sent back to their old lives with a modest pension. The latter is rare, for there are always wars to fight for the Empire and for Sigmar!	false
technologies_long_description_wh_main_tech_emp_barracks_3	Regimental musicians play drums, horns, or maybe other, more exotic instruments. There are plenty of examples throughout history; the Wolfenburg Jaegers, for example, had a flautist who played an instrument made from the arm bone of a Catrazzian Birdman. In any case, a musician is there to play a tune to keep the men in time and boost their morale.	false
technologies_long_description_wh_main_tech_emp_barracks_4	The Empire is unique amongst the nations of men in keeping a standing army on its books. It has been so for centuries, perhaps as early as Hedrich I - although his army were tribal warriors, not the professional soldiery of the present day. Still, when fighting on many fronts the army regularly runs low on regulars. At these times, others must be drafted in, either by press-ganging or by payment of a retainer in lieu of a full salary.	false
technologies_long_description_wh_main_tech_emp_barracks_5	Wagons crammed with supplies and looked after by stern and bearded quartermasters follow in an army's wake, enabling it to range further from home and ensure that it is fed and watered. Such wagon trains also need protection, of course, for while allowing armies a longer leash, that same leash can easily be cut if exposed to the enemy.	false
technologies_long_description_wh_main_tech_emp_barracks_6	An Imperial crossbow and handgunner regiment is a formidable force. Some eagle-eyed members can pick off a noble's plume at a hundred and twenty paces with their crossbows, yet the secret of volley fire is not range nor even sight of the target, but firing as one into the sky to rain a hail of death upon the unfortunate enemy.	false
technologies_long_description_wh_main_tech_emp_forges_1	With Bretonnia the exception - as they see black powder as unchivalrous - the other nations look enviously upon the Empire and their ability to deploy massed handgunners on the battlefield. The secret of black powder is still one only shared between the Empire and the Dwarfs, and - despite diplomatic and espionage by the likes of Estalia - the formulation and the ability to mass-produce ammunition remains with Sigmar's people.	false
technologies_long_description_wh_main_tech_emp_forges_2	Siege Masters is an ad hock term given to Master Engineers and veteran gunsmiths that excel in creating larger, heavy calibre guns and cannons. This has led to some catastrophes during the testing phase and the loss of many apprentices' lives. However, some results have been successful, giving the Empire the edge in siege warfare - or so they claim, much to Dwarfen consternation!	false
technologies_long_description_wh_main_tech_emp_forges_3	Decades after the rifle came to prominence, someone discovered that spinning the shot as it left the barrel via rifling the inside increased both the weapon's distance and its accuracy. Whether this someone was a man or Dwarf is contested by both races. What is certain is that rifling techniques work, but are not the easiest to mass-produce due to the intricate machinery required.	false
technologies_long_description_wh_main_tech_emp_forges_4	Gunnery crews are trained at the Imperial Gunnery school at Nuln and then shipped, with their cannons, all across the Empire in its defence. It's these grizzled folk who can range a target with a quick glimpse, factoring in such variables as wind speed and gradients. Veterans also tend to name their artillery pieces, which is why cannons known as "Bertha Bristle Breeches" and "That Bastard, Jack" have scoured the Empire's foes for many years.	false
technologies_long_description_wh_main_tech_emp_forges_5	The eccentricities of the Empire's architects is well-known. Each is desperate to outdo the others with their opulent, grandiose and impractical designs. Yet somehow, as if in defiance of gravity, the buildings remain upright and get taller and more crooked every year. The grander structures are more than simple curios - great edifices like the Imperial palace and the Grand Temple of Sigmar are true man-made buildings of wonder. 	false
technologies_long_description_wh_main_tech_emp_forges_6	The better the firing rate of artillery pieces, the higher the chance of scoring multiple hits. The Empire pride themselves on their rapidity in this matter, honed by many firing drills. The Dwarfs, in comparison, prefer a more measured approach by ensuring that the first shot hits the target or achieving the same rates by technical means such as their Organ Gun. For the Empire though, a well-drilled crew is a successful one.	false
technologies_long_description_wh_main_tech_emp_port_1	Considering its size, the Empire has relatively little coastline and is land-locked on three sides. Therefore, fishing fleets must either venture into the Sea of Claws or trust the Old World's gargantuan rivers to provide a decent haul. Prayers to Manann or even Stromfels can help, along with the odd sacrifice of a cat thrown overboard - usually garnered from one of the port's dingy alleys. 	false
technologies_long_description_wh_main_tech_emp_port_2	The merchant fleets are another arm to the Burgomeisters' trade monopolies. The Empire's nobles have had a taste of the exotic for decades, so the merchant barons have chartered ships to appease their desires and make a rich profit off the back of such enterprises. Of course, plying the seas of this world is not without its dangers - and not just from enemy fleets either - so merchants must weigh up the risk of investing in such ventures against a potentially lucrative reward. 	false
technologies_long_description_wh_main_tech_emp_port_3	With whole landmasses still unknown to even the most educated of the Empire's scholars, it is no wonder that the seas beyond the Old World still largely remain a mystery - a conundrum that only the High Elves have solved. Yet there are, of course, sea charts such as those created by the so-called Mapwright, that show coastal areas and even trade routes used and jealously guarded by the Elves. 	false

technologies_long_description_wh_main_tech_emp_smith_1	How the local State Troops are armed and armoured is the responsibility of the province's Elector Count, and to a lesser extent, his Grafs and quartermasters, varying greatly depending on the needs and desires of the Elector. Some favour a unified approach, some do not care what their soldiers go to war in, while others simply don't fancy the expense of providing forged armour for mere commoners.	false
technologies_long_description_wh_main_tech_emp_smith_2	States Troops are not Free Company, but are expected to be armed with weapons of similar quality. This is to ensure the regiment functions as a capable unit, because only disciplined men, working as one, who can overcome the dread things they have to face in battle. Of course, the cost of such weapons comes from individual soldiers' purses. After all, no Elector is going to bankrupt himself by providing essentials out of his own pocket.	false
technologies_long_description_wh_main_tech_emp_smith_3	Fast cavalry units such as Pistoliers and Outriders have much lighter raiments than the Empire's Knights, as their function is very different. Pistoliers use their manoeuvrability to find good firing spots from which to harass the enemy, quickly moving on when they are inevitably spotted. As a result, a lighter armour is necessary to enable them to swiftly ride away and repeat the process elsewhere on the field.	false
technologies_long_description_wh_main_tech_emp_smith_4	While the Dwarfs were the first to fashion iron and turn it into steel, it can be argued that in the latter ages the innovations of the Empire have moved the technology onwards even further. Metal-workers, engineers and smiths have created much strange and exotic weaponry, although the largest orders are for heavier, larger weapons or longer, harder lances. 	false
technologies_long_description_wh_main_tech_emp_smith_5	The secrets of forging stronger steel are held exclusively by Dwarfs and men. It was the Dwarfs that were the world's first true metalworkers, but thanks to centuries of alliances they have shared some, if not all, secrets of the process with the nascent Empire. Soon human smiths were super-heating iron and adding charcoal to create stronger, more pliant steel - the perfect material for making full-plate armour. 	false
technologies_long_description_wh_main_tech_emp_smith_6	Steam tanks are known as Iron Behemoths, for they are all but indestructible. However, this isn't quite true, as twelve were originally manufactured but only eight remain. It therefore stands to reason that they can actually be damaged after all. To this end, an even thicker armour has been developed which improves defence but makes contraptions heavier - not necessarily what you want on the notoriously-muddy battlefields of the Old World!	false
technologies_long_description_wh_main_tech_emp_stables_1	Some spirited young nobles gather their friends and found Pistolier regiments of their own, but most join the ranks of the Pistolkorps, a military organisation funded by the Emperor, the Imperial Engineers School and sponsored by several Knightly Orders. Once a rally call goes out, the local Pistolkorps chapter sees frenetic activity as nobles jostle to be represented in the forthcoming war.	false
technologies_long_description_wh_main_tech_emp_stables_2	Bretonnians like to carp on about how their steeds are the best in the known world, but the liveries of the Empire can certainly compete. Empire warhorses are large, war-tested beasts, capable of charging at full force with a heavily-armoured Knight on its back without rearing in panic. This isn't by chance, of course, such steeds are hand-reared and trained to perform on battlescapes where blood and magic are flying about.	false
technologies_long_description_wh_main_tech_emp_stables_3	Those that that can beat a regular tattoo while their horse gallops or sound the horn at the Preceptor's command aid a unit's cohesion. A co-ordinated charge is always better than Knights acting individually, as they are wont to do on occasion for personal glory. However, should a Grand Master hear of such idiocy then the Knight responsible faces expulsion - told to go and join those vain, glory-hunting fools in Bretonnia.	false
technologies_long_description_wh_main_tech_emp_stables_4	The noble-born warriors of the Empire do not form part of a standing army, for to do so would mean rubbing shoulders with the common soldiery. Instead, they typically fight for one of the Knightly Orders - heroic brotherhoods of warriors. From their ranks the veterans, the Inner Circle Knights picked to fight with retinues of less-experienced, but still deadly warriors, guide them to victory.	false
technologies_long_description_wh_main_tech_emp_stables_5	Standards are key to a regiment's success on the battlefield. The bearer chosen to hold it aloft in battle knows they occupy an honoured position among their peers, for the rallying power of the standard can mean the difference between victory and defeat. Reiksguard are a different breed of warrior, brave and proficient in arms. Their standard bearers are of such calibre that the flag will be kept flying no matter who they face.	false
technologies_long_description_wh_main_tech_emp_stables_6	An Order's veteran Knights form its Inner Circle. Together they form retinues that often accompany the Grand Master, or some other commander of great import, in battle. Potential candidates are invited to attend the inner workings of the Knightly Order following a great feat in battle. However, this alone is not enough - the candidate must also epitomise the virtues of the Order. 	false
technologies_long_description_wh_main_tech_emp_worship_1	Although it is the remit of Sigmar's Templars of the Silver Hammer to seek out and destroy the cults of Chaos and Necromancy, should a Warrior Priest come across such a fell conclave it is his duty to gather a party of locals or hired swords and do the job themselves, should the Witch Hunters be absent.	false
technologies_long_description_wh_main_tech_emp_worship_2	The Grand Theogonist and his Arch Lectors are not ones for sitting behind desks in the Grand Temple's vestry. They often tour the provinces, subtly enforcing the tenets of Imperial rule, as well as confronting enemies and banishing Chaos wherever it rears its ugly heads. Following a successful visit they give their divine sanction and declare the area free from corrupting influences, although one can never truly banish evil from the world. 	false
technologies_long_description_wh_main_tech_emp_worship_3	Fighting Chaos and all the other evil that confronts the Empire is an ongoing concern, with no true victory in sight. All a Grand Theogonist can do is keep evil at bay by using his considerable resources - whether that is his battle-hardened clergy, penitent nobles and Grafs, devoted Knightly Orders or the Holy Order of Templars.   	false
technologies_long_description_wh_main_tech_grn_main_1_1	Although dismissed as "speccy gits" by their Orc cousins, without them, Greenskins would still be seen as savages. Goblin Tinkerers have a curious desire to know "how fings work". They're the ones that take apart Dwarf gear assemblies in the lost Holds and who fashion crude armour by heating it in forges - although it costs them a few teef to get some big lug of an Orc to start smashing the molten metal with 'ammers. It's also the Tinkerers that are largely responsible for Greenskin war machines. Although the basic principles of the Rock Lobbers and catapults have been shamelessly pilfered from Dwarf innovations, plagiarism has never been a concern for Goblins.	false
technologies_long_description_wh_main_tech_grn_main_1_2	War Boars that don't die in battle will most likely perish from injuries or even exhaustion in the aftermath. The few boars that survive to an older age - or those that lack the typical ferocious porcine attitude - are demoted to beasts of burden, there to pull carts laden with loot, enemy gear and loads of shiny stuff!	false
technologies_long_description_wh_main_tech_grn_main_1_3	Bullies are primarily used to crack the whip at Goblin war machine crews, making sure they stay by their tools of destruction even when the enemy gets close. Recently, Warbosses have been expanding the Bullies' role to ensure that not just war machine crews stay put and get the job done, but mobs of Goblins muster properly and not scamper off at the first sign of trouble. It's all a question of who the gobbos fear the most - is it the enemy or a veteran Big 'Un (who will happily rip off a limb of a fleeing gobbo and then smack the others with it to halt a rout)? For most Goblins, it's probably the latter.	false
technologies_long_description_wh_main_tech_grn_main_1_4	Goblins are better suited to war machine duty as they are a cowardly lot and prefer to stand back and fight things from afar. Orc crews tend to get too excited about the approaching battle and in their frustration get their choppas out and run forward to join the fray, leaving their war machines abandoned. Therefore it's Goblins - with the occasional Orc Bully overseer - that operate the lobbers and catapults, and while they're better than Orcs, they are still not ideal crew. Big levers ensure they keep firing, even when under pressure.	false
technologies_long_description_wh_main_tech_grn_main_2_1	Orcs are not subtle - they make things "betta" by adding things that are "bigga". In the case of wheelz this does actually work, as the larger diameter means more distance can be covered in a shorter time, which is especially useful when going into a charge! Not that Orcs are bothered by the physics, they just love "ta pimp up da wagonz" to show up their rivals. When not in battle they'll gather in popular spots at night, drink lots of grog and have drag races, tearing up the primitive tracks and exhausting their boars - much to the consternation of older, dourer Orcs.	false
technologies_long_description_wh_main_tech_grn_main_2_2	Covering a Boar Chariot in metal plates makes the crew more difficult to hit and generally strengthens the whole contraption. Of course, the Orcs riding the chariots have to fight over the same defences and run the risk of slicing off their own limbs as they thrust their choppas out over shards of razor-sharp metal - not that health and safety has even been a Greenskin concern...	false
technologies_long_description_wh_main_tech_grn_main_2_3	Greenskins want their war machines and vehicles to be as lethal as possible. The typical Orc answer to this dilemma is to attach a load of spiky stuff and shove some scythey things onto the wheels of chariots. As crude a solution as this is, it works for the Orcs and Goblins, and that's more than good enough!	false
technologies_long_description_wh_main_tech_grn_main_3_1	Catapults and lobbers are powered by the tension and release of animal sinews. Boar and even Goblin sinew is typically used as its readily available, but it's Troll intestine that is undoubtedly the best because it is so tough, having to contain the caustic bile in every Troll belly. To get at the sinew you obviously need a Troll's carcass, not an ideal item to have on any shopping list - especially if the only Trolls around are still alive at the time!	false
technologies_long_description_wh_main_tech_grn_main_3_2	Bat-Winged Loonies or Doom Divers, as they are also known, are as mad as they look - devoid of the usual Goblin instinct to survive by throwing their mates in the way of any peril! Instead, they actually want to be strapped into a catapult and sent skywards like a shot from a humie rifle - the nutters! The height a Doom Diver can reach is dependent on the quality of his hand-stitched wings and the aerodynamics of his coned helmet, all of which require skill and materials to create.	false
technologies_long_description_wh_main_tech_grn_main_3_3	Orcs are not known for thinking too much about armour. For them it's all about attack rather than defence. Having said that, they see the men of the Empire covered in full plate, the Dwarfs' solidly-crafted armour, and even the dreaded Chaos Warriors and realise that maybe some armour platin' is a good idea. The Orcs leave it to the gobbos to scavenge metal from battlefields and then fashion armour in their crude forges, before using buckles and Squig-leather to strap it to their heaving green chests and muscled bulks.	false
technologies_long_description_wh_main_tech_grn_main_4_1	The Spider-god demands veneration from the forest tribes if they are to ride its offspring into battle; eight-legged totems festooned with webbed skulls appear alongside the traditional idols of Gork and Mork. Before large battles, one of the weaker members of the tribe - even the occasional volunteer - is wrapped in webbing and laid before the cobweb-shrouded gloomy hollows as an offering to the Spiders and their arachnid god. Should the Feaster from Beyond be appeased, then the Spiders are more willing to fight for the Greenskins.	false
technologies_long_description_wh_main_tech_grn_main_squigs	Even by Greenskin standards, Squigs – or ‘Squiggly Beasts’ to use their full name – are nasty. And not a little bit nasty either – really nasty and pretty disgusting to boot. Having even less brain than their Greenskin masters, Squigs can just about manage to move and kill in the most hideous way imaginable. Hapless victims of a Squig can expect to be bitten clean in two just for starters, with the rest of their short, painful lives occupied by screaming and, well, dying in agony really. As you can imagine, herding a bunch of vicious, hungry Squigs into battle is a bit of a poisoned chalice – getting them vaguely into the right place without being eaten is more than most hapless gobbo handlers can hope to achieve. How utterly, irredeemably bonkers would a Goblin have to be, then, to wilfully ride a Squig into battle? Just hanging on is hard enough, let alone staying alive long enough to attack the foe once battle has been joined!	false
technologies_long_description_wh_main_tech_grn_side_1_1_1	While Savage Orcs are still happy to produce blades of flint and bone, more "kultured" Greenskins look upon their enemies with their forged metal points and want in on the action. Compared to the fine metalwork of their arch-foes, the Dwarfs, or even the humies, Goblin smithing is crude at best. Nevertheless, many gobbos have learnt to get a fine point upon their spears. Even if they can't fashion one themselves, there are always plenty of spearheads littering the battlefields to purloin, discarded by the other races.	false
technologies_long_description_wh_main_tech_grn_side_1_1_2	For Orcs, "bigga is betta" is the general mantra, but that doesn't always work - especially with flying objects. Goblins cottoned on early that the smaller the mass, the better it flies. That's why it's the gobbos that take the wings of a Doom Diver, rather than their bulkier Orc kin. While Greenskins generally like their big arrer 'eads, they realised change was needed when "those bloody pointy-eared gits" - and even the humies - could fire their arrers further than the Orcs.	false
technologies_long_description_wh_main_tech_grn_side_1_2_1	The "sty-boss" is the Orc that ends up in charge of keeping the boars housed, fed and watered when not in battle. It's his job to round up the gobbos that form part of the "cleaning krew" and to ensure a healthy ruttin' program. This is not too complicated as it usually just involves putting a male and female boar in the same sty and - assuming they don't gouge each other to shreds - letting nature take its course, hopefully producing an even stronger breed in the process.	false
technologies_long_description_wh_main_tech_grn_side_1_2_2	Goblins have close relationships with their chosen mount until the wolf gets hungry enough to throw and then eat its rider, but that's relatively rare. The Boss of the mob will usually ride the alpha wolf and gets to pick his mount's future mate - usually the next fastest wolf of the correct gender. This, in a very crude way, ensures the next generation of wolves run even fasta or so the Goblins believe - and if Greenskins believe in something enough then it usually happens!	false
technologies_long_description_wh_main_tech_grn_side_1_3_1	Giants and Trolls are even less sophisticated creatures than Orcs. A Giant's normal weapon is an upended tree trunk and Trolls tend to use bones and large boughs to maim their enemies. With a little jiggery-pokery - by adding extra spikes or discarded metal plates and shards - the gobbos can make these clubs even more deadly in the hands of such monsters.	false
technologies_long_description_wh_main_tech_grn_side_1_3_2	Black Orcs look on the other Goblinoids with sheer contempt, and have little time for the animosity and bickering rife amongst the ranks of their green-skinned relations. Such is their scorn that they refuse to accept the behaviour in their presence. With this in mind, it doesn't take Warbosses long to realise that getting a Black Orc to bellow orders and blunt threats at the lesser Orcs - and even administer physical violence - keeps the gits in line and their small minds on fightin' the enemy at hand.	false
technologies_long_description_wh_main_tech_grn_side_2_1_1	Every Orc worth his choppa knows that painting something red makes it faster. This applies mainly to chariots, but Boar Boyz and even gobbos have daubed their mounts in red to get a little more "umph" out of their beasts on occasion. Of course, if you were of a mind to challenge an Orc why painting stuff red makes it go faster, they would be at a loss other than to say "it just does" (before hitting you with their choppa for being so impertinent).	false
technologies_long_description_wh_main_tech_grn_side_2_2_1	Despite the ramshackle nature of Greenskin vehicles, Orcs will keep 'ammerin' bits of wood onto their chariots to make them tougher. The trouble is, the more you reinforce a chassis, the heavier the chariot becomes and so harder for the mounts to pull. Heavy chariots also tend to get stuck more often and even - ironically - break apart more easily when going over ruts, as they lack the flexibility of a lighter chassis. Yet if an Orc can get the balance right - mostly by fluke - he will get a stronger chassis that's able to take more of a poundin'.	false
technologies_long_description_wh_main_tech_grn_side_2_3_1	Orcs are always after a larger choppa, as it follows the Greenskin mantra of "bigga is betta". Obviously, the heavier the weapon the more of a brute an Orc has to be to wield it with any degree of success. Warbosses, Big 'Uns and Black Orcs have the largest choppas as they are the biggest Orcs. As all boyz crave to have big choppas, the Boss that can supply them will get much kudos among the mobs.	false
technologies_long_description_wh_main_tech_grn_side_3_1_1	Bows work on the tension of the bowstring and the strength of an archer's arm. Being a weedy lot, all Goblins can pull are short bows. Orcs fair better with larger ones, but are not the most accurate archers in the world by a long shot - pun intended. As well as being scared of Elves, Goblins also noticed that the pointy-eared gits fired their arrows a fair bit faster than they did. A lot of that is to do with natural talent and centuries of practice - two things Greenskins could not be bothered with - but it is also about how Elven bows are strung. They use a reverse twist to store more tension, which the Goblins can copy.	false
technologies_long_description_wh_main_tech_grn_side_3_2_1	A sane Night Goblin can't lift the great iron balls of the Fanatics, only those with longa chains, driven mad by drinking the fungus brew (the recipe of which is still a closely guarded secret, shared only with other Night Goblin Shamans) have a larger arc of death. Once imbued by the Mad Cap potion, the insanity it creates also brings great strength. The gobbo is given the chained ball and then, when the time is right, unleashed on the battlefield! While the casualties caused will be as random as the direction in which the loony swinger spins, gobbos reason that making the chains longer should increase the number of deaths caused. The downside of all this is that there's a greater chance that the Fanatic will wrap himself up in chain and ball more easily, but then who cares what happens to him in the end anyway?	false
technologies_long_description_wh_main_tech_grn_side_3_3_1	Orcs armour their War Boars, not because they particularly care about their beasts, but because they want to ensure they reach the enemy intact. A Boar Boy will get the "right 'ump" if his mount is shot from under him before he can get a charge in, so they get the gobbos to strap crude barding and even 'eavy metal plates to the beast. This is not a task any Goblin savours, for boars don't welcome being impeded by such cumbersome gear. Wolves and spiders like it even less - a Spider has it's own natural protection with a hardened carapace, and a wolf wants to run free rather than be weighed down. It doesn't stop some Goblins trying to emulate the Boar Boyz though - idiots!	false
technologies_long_description_wh_main_tech_grn_side_4_1_1	Creating a hatchery within an environment controlled by the Forest Goblins allows the gobbos to control and modify the behaviour of the maturing broodlings to create even more ferocious arachnid mounts. Setting up such a hatchery is no easy task, a Forest Goblin - usually the Shaman of the tribe - (or one of their number that has already built up an immunisation to venom through a thousand spider bites) must venture deep into a spider's web-strewn lair to steal away its eggs.	false
technologies_long_description_wh_main_tech_grn_unlock_arachnarok	The darkest forests of the world are the home to the Gigantic Spiders. These venomous creatures grow to an enormous size, sucking the life juices out of prey and leaving behind only skin-husks and bones. A full-grown Gigantic Spider is larger than a Troll, and its whole body is protected by chitinous armour plates. All Gigantic Spiders have a poisonous bite that is used to paralyse their prey. Only the most foolhardy would attempt to seek them out, and Forest Goblin Shamans, with their spectacular lack of common sense, fit well into that category. A gifted Shaman, touched by the Spider-god's blessings, will not be turned into a lifeless husk, but instead may be rewarded with a clutch of spiderlings. This foul brood - each spider already the size of a horse's head - can be reared and trained. When fully grown, these Gigantic Spiders are prized as revered mounts for a Goblin tribe's mightiest warriors.	false
technologies_long_description_wh_main_tech_grn_unlock_doomdiver	The height the Doom Diver can reach is largely dependent on the quality of his hand-stitched leather wings and, perhaps even more importantly, how far back his crew can pull him on the sinew. It has been known for over zealous types to pull the entire device from its mounts - but more often than not the Doom Diver is stretched back to the limits of the crew's strength and let go with a loud "TWANG!" Ripping skywards like a bullet, the Doom Diver reaches cloud level before beginning his dive. Using his wings, the gobbo spirals and guides himself towards the chosen target. As the downward descent gains speed, most Goblins emit a high-pitched scream that grows louder and more irritating as they plummets earthwards. With worrying rapidity, the black speck in the sky expands into the plunging Doom Diver. When the Goblin finally impacts, the Greenskin himself might splatter altogether or, if he has effectively applied his wings as brakes and is a bit lucky, he might bounce. Either way a Doom Diver is likely to cause considerable damage to any foe he lands upon.	false
technologies_long_description_wh_main_tech_grn_unlock_rocklobber	Orcs and Goblins were introduced to catapults, or “fings wot throw roks”, shortly after they encountered the Dwarfs. Greenskins are not technically minded (particularly Orcs), but they have a great appetite for destruction. Even as boulders splattered their foes, Orcs and Goblins began to wish for some catapults of their own. Since then, the Greenskins have built a plethora of what they generally refer to as “lobbers”. These are deployed either singly or in batteries to soften up enemy formations, smash defensive positions, or to toss those that offend the Warboss very, very far. A great shot, one that pulverises a large amount of the foes or sends body pieces flying particularly high, always raises a rowdy cheer. Most Rock Lobbers are counterweight devices, although some use twisted rope to generate torque. Experiments with Troll-powered devices have been tried, but such creatures tend to eat either the animation or key parts of the machine (or both). Some war engines, especially those that have launched spectacularly bloody shots, are given names, such as the legendary Skull Crusher, Fings Chucker, and Hammer of Gork. The Rock Lobber known as Da Boss’ Bane, named for its habit of landing off target and smashing the tribe’s Warboss, was burned, along with its crew, as a precautionary measure by an unusually bright new leader.	false

technologies_short_description_wh3_main_tech_cth_14	Every soul in the Celestial Empire, no matter how low-born, is deserving of the Dragon Emperor's care. It falls to Yuan Bo, the Jade Dragon, to share His purse amongst the commonfolk.	false
technologies_short_description_wh3_main_tech_cth_15	Because the Moon Empress blesses every arrow in the Celestial Empire, it is contingent upon our fletchers to construct them with the utmost care, and our archers to not waste even a single shot.	false
technologies_short_description_wh3_main_tech_cth_16	As the moon's silver light washes over us, Quai Yin shall grant Her blessing. Darkness shall hone our blades, and shadows shall form our armour.	false
technologies_short_description_wh3_main_tech_cth_17	The Dragon Emperor has seen countless species rise and fall, and can teach us much of them. The ancient Chelonian turtles possessed nigh-unbreakable shells – this, we can recreate with wood and steel.	false
technologies_short_description_wh3_main_tech_cth_18	"Strike fast, strike hard, no mercy" is a fine mantra, but futile should the enemy feel similarly. Defence is of equal import, and uncannily lightweight alchemical steel shall provide it.	false

technologies_short_description_wh3_main_tech_cth_23	Absolute discipline. Perfect alignment of purpose. Every soldier knowing their place. This is the Harmony of Stone and Steel.	false
technologies_short_description_wh3_main_tech_cth_24	It is the Jade Warriors who keep the great cities of Cathay safe, but they are too gracious to demand promotion. Thus, we must identify and raise up their finest ourselves.	false
technologies_short_description_wh3_main_tech_cth_25	It takes time for a newly-awakened Sentinel to regain its full might, as it sheds the moss and earth of years, but the correct incantations will instantly purge all such detritus.	false
technologies_short_description_wh3_main_tech_cth_26	Yang is the strength of the soul. Yang is the flame in the heart and the fire in our veins. Yang is the roar from the lungs. Yang is the iron within our bones and the stone beneath our skins.	false
technologies_short_description_wh3_main_tech_cth_27	The Dragon Emperor's Celestial fire burns hotter than all else. Bricks baked in the Burning Wind emerge strong and flawless, all the better to build great monuments to Xen Yang.	false

technologies_short_description_wh3_main_tech_cth_36	Yin-Yin rules over the Jade Sea and far beyond, and it is she who keeps Cathay's ports safe from crime and corruption. Only by the Sea Dragon's grace is fresh trade allowed or disallowed.	false

technologies_short_description_wh3_main_tech_cth_41	Our legion can learn to draw from within themselves an invisible miasma of the Moon Empress' enduring love, which as it envelops our foes shall blunt their every strike.	false
technologies_short_description_wh3_main_tech_cth_42	Previously unseen beyond the Forests of the Moon, a pitch-black tree which yields lumber as tough as fresh-forged iron has spread to the slopes of Kunlan – no doubt with Quai Yin's blessing.	false

technologies_short_description_wh3_main_tech_cth_44	The Ogre merchants of the Ivory Road charge a pretty penny to have their trained Giants stomp on our cannon wadding, but the compressed results can be loaded with incredible speed.	false
technologies_short_description_wh3_main_tech_cth_45	A criss-crossing of miniature blades within the gun barrel's interior scores hundreds of vicious edges into every piece of shot. Only Nan-Gau's most diligent artificers can achieve this feat.	false
technologies_short_description_wh3_main_tech_cth_46	A fresh edict: only those born to a family which has known no short-sightedness or blindness for five generations may wield a Jade crossbow. Even then, they must prove themselves.	false
technologies_short_description_wh3_main_tech_cth_47	The Moon Empress can take any form, and it is thanks to her time spent running with the herds, free as the wind, that we may now learn the language of horses.	false
technologies_short_description_wh3_main_tech_cth_48	Every Spirit Qilin yearns to return to the Celestial Mountains, and have been known to depart for them even in the heat of battle. Incanting a Yang rite upon their reins will ensure obedience.	false
technologies_short_description_wh3_main_tech_cth_49	The Dragon Emperor sees all, and so it is that an infusion of His Celestial magic can grant sight beyond sight to His most loyal believers.	false
technologies_short_description_wh3_main_tech_cth_5	Stillness of the mind and soul are virtues to which we all must aspire. Only with impeccable discipline and balance may we truly prevail against wickedness.	false
technologies_short_description_wh3_main_tech_cth_50	In public, all obey the Dragon Emperor without question, but in private many provinces vie for independence and power. Those who serve Him faithfully shall be rewarded.	false
technologies_short_description_wh3_main_tech_cth_51	Rare crystals litter the peaks of Kunlan, each of which absorbed a fragment of the Celestial energy unleashed by the Dragon Emperor's birth. Once socketed into an anvil, divine armour may be forged.	false

technologies_short_description_wh3_main_tech_cth_54	Retired Gate Masters – with the Dragon Emperor's tacit approval – often train underworld denizens in the ways of the Jade Warriors. In this way, even criminals are taught balance.	false
technologies_short_description_wh3_main_tech_cth_55	Some say meditation is relaxation. This is a grave misconception, for Yang meditation amplifies the will and dampens all need. Its most capable practitioners can go days without rest or fodder.	false
technologies_short_description_wh3_main_tech_cth_56	The House of Secrets skirts the edges of morality and legality, but a carefully-worded edict would further legitimise its renegade wizards. In turn, it would share its best and brightest with us.	false
technologies_short_description_wh3_main_tech_cth_57	It is on the backs of the hard-working commonfolk that every noble of Cathay stands, and it is past time they were shown gratitude. Send forth for the finest dishes in all the Celestial Empire!	false
technologies_short_description_wh3_main_tech_cth_58	Every child of Cathay is taught to fear the Great Enemy, but as adulthood descends, so too does temptation grow. Mandatory re-education and thrice-daily prayer to the Dragon Emperor is thus required.	false
technologies_short_description_wh3_main_tech_cth_59	A single brass lever activates thousands of pulleys, arranged in a dense lattice even the most brilliant of minds could not untangle, and quickly drags the Compass into shuddering arrangement.	false

technologies_short_description_wh3_main_tech_cth_63	The Moon Empress weeps for every fallen child of Cathay. For this reason, she has been known to walk amongst those who follow her creed, disguised as a peasant healer, tending to the wounded and dying.	false
technologies_short_description_wh3_main_tech_cth_64	Some mistake darkness for wickedness. Those who worship Quai Yin know that, in truth, darkness is purity, and to give themselves to the peace of night will answer their every need.	false
technologies_short_description_wh3_main_tech_cth_65	Great feats of archery, great deeds of subterfuge, great acts of charity: this is how the Moon Dragon's blessed favour is won.	false

technologies_short_description_wh3_main_tech_cth_68	Vermillion Warbird hatchlings, before they reach full and fiery maturity, may be used as spotters, scattering harmless dancing flames in the vicinity of Crane Gunners' distant targets.	false
technologies_short_description_wh3_main_tech_cth_69	When not dousing the Dragon Emperor's foes in purifying flame, the Dragon Fire Throwers mounted upon a Sky-Junk's perimeter can belch their emissions towards the craft's rear, further increasing thrust.	false
technologies_short_description_wh3_main_tech_cth_7	Harmony brings unity, and unity brings efficiency. The warriors of wind and field must be taught to trust one another implicitly, for each is an extension of the Dragon Emperor's will, fighting as one.	false
technologies_short_description_wh3_main_tech_cth_70	More space on the Ivory Road means more capacity for the Caravans leaving Shang-Yang.	false
technologies_short_description_wh3_main_tech_cth_8	Cathay's provincial troops are loyal and numberless, but they are crude and unrefined soldiers. There is such great potential in them, waiting only to be unlocked.	false
technologies_short_description_wh3_main_tech_cth_9	A system of bellows and fine brass funnels ensures that escaped heat is recaptured and reused rather than wasted, thus granting greater lift and range for our Sky Lanterns.	false

technologies_short_description_wh3_main_tech_kho_1_2	Though carnage is its own reward, if offered sufficient tribute the Skull Throne may on occasion grant unto us great tools of destruction. Our fury shall be augmented by legendary steel.	false
technologies_short_description_wh3_main_tech_kho_1_3	An ocean of hatred! A flood of fury! A spreading sea of purest rage and unbound wrath! All must hear the call to slaughter!	false
technologies_short_description_wh3_main_tech_kho_1_4	Destruction alone will not suffice. We are not animals! We are crusaders, driven by fury and fervour in equal measure, and we will exact the tribute that great Kharneth is due.	false
