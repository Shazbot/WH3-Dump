pooled_resources_description_bst_dread	Dread is the currency used to invoke the Dark Gods to strengthen your tribe via the Rewards of Dread panel. It is acquired by completing missions, razing settlements and winning battles, with more Dread received the more enemy casualties inflicted. Dread can be spent on expanding unit and [[img:icon_hero]][[/img]]Hero capacities, recruiting [[img:icon_general]][[/img]]Legendary Lords, and other upgrades.	false
pooled_resources_description_bst_herdstone_shard	Herdstone Shards are the raw materials required to raise Herdstones. Additional Shards are attained when reaching certain [[img:icon_marks_of_ruination]][[/img]]Ruination Levels as you progress through the campaign and can never be lost, only reused. Shards are regained after casting a Ritual of Ruin or if a Herdstone gets destroyed before the ritual is performed.	false
pooled_resources_description_bst_momentum	Momentum dictates how long a Rampage is sustained. As long as Momentum stays above zero, battle victories will continue to accumulate [[img:icon_rampage]][[/img]]Rampage Marks, but if all Momentum is lost a Rampage must restart. Momentum decreases every turn but also when Taurox loses battles, retreats, or when using his [[img:icon_effect_campaign_movement]][[/img]]movement range replenishment ability. Once reaching zero, Momentum can be regained simply by winning a battle.	false
pooled_resources_description_bst_rampage	Rampage Marks are collected as Taurox wins successive battles, repeatedly filling the Rampage bar to periodically offer various rewards. The rate at which the Rampage bar fills depends on the strength of opponents and the number of battles fought in a single turn. To sustain a Rampage, [[img:icon_momentum]][[/img]]Momentum must be kept above zero – once all Momentum is lost due to inactivity or other factors, all Rampage Marks are lost.	false
pooled_resources_description_bst_ruination	Ruination Level is a measure of the warherd’s progress, increasing as Marks of Ruination are collected. Once a Herdstone has been erected, razing settlements in the surrounding Blood-grounds will earn Devastation which in turn can be converted to Marks of Ruination by way of a Ritual of Ruin. The higher the level of razed settlements, the more Marks of Ruination earned for performing the ritual.	false

pooled_resources_description_def_slaves	[[img:icon_slaves]][[/img]]Slaves are the lifeblood of the Dark Elf economy, captured in battle as well as by other means to provide additional [[img:icon_income]][[/img]]income. High numbers of slaves grant construction bonuses, but can negatively affect  [[img:icon_public_order]][[/img]]control. Slaves can be sacrificed to perform rites and provincial slave diktats.	false
pooled_resources_description_dwf_oathgold	Forging items consumes [[img:icon_oathgold]][[/img]]Oathgold. [[img:icon_oathgold]][[/img]]Oathgold can be obtained from certain buildings, characters skills, recycling magic items or completing grudges and quests.	false

pooled_resources_description_emp_loyalty	[[img:emp_fealty]][[/img]]Fealty is the measure of how strongly an Elector believes in the cause of the Empire.
