--	NARRATIVE EVENT TEMPLATES
--
--	PURPOSE
--	This file defines narrative events templates. These templates can be used by any scripts that set up narrative 
--	event chains - either shared, racial, or campaign-specific.
--
--	See the script documentation for more information about the underlying narrative event system.
--
--	LOADED
--	This file is loaded by wh3_narrative_loader.lua, which in turn should be loaded by the per-campaign narrative 
--	script file. It should get loaded on start of script.

--- @desc Creates and starts a narrative event that starts an intervention with the supplied configuration and trigger callbacks. This allows the calling script to customise what happens within the intervention. It can also be used to trigger an intervention with a customised setup (e.g. must-trigger) which can be useful for starting a series of narrative events that would otherwise wait behind an event panel.
--- @p @string unique name, Unique name amongst other declared narrative events.
--- @p @string faction key, Key of the faction to which this narrative event applies, from the <code>factions</code> database table.
--- @p [opt=nil] @function configuration callback, Intervention configuration callback. If supplied, this is passed to @narrative_event:add_intervention_configuration_callback to pre-configure the @intervention associated with the narrative event prior to it being triggered. The callback will be passed the @intervention object as a single argument when called.
--- @p [opt=nil] @function trigger callback, Trigger callback to call when the @intervention is triggered. If supplied, this is passed to @narrative_event:set_trigger_callback. The callback will be passed the @string triggering message, and a callback which can be used to prevent the narrative event completing immediately. Call the callback with <code>false</code> as an argument to stop it completing, then later with <code>true</code> as an argument to complete.
--- @p @string trigger message, Script message on which the narrative event should trigger. This can also be a @table of strings if multiple trigger messages are desired.
--- @p [opt=nil] @string on-issued message, Message to trigger when the narrative event has finished issuing. This can be a @table of strings if multiple on-issued messages are desired.

--- @desc The <code>allow_issue_completed_callback</code> passed to the callback may be called with <code>false</code> supplied as an argument to prevent the narrative event from completing automatically.

--- @function gain_pooled_resource_scripted
--- @desc Creates and starts a narrative event that issues a mission for the specified faction to gain a specified amount of one or more specified pooled resources. Unlike @narrative_events:gain_pooled_resource this sets up a scripted mission, where script is responsible for the completion of the mission. This allows multiple pooled resources to be considered at the same time, either additively or not, allowing mission constructs such as "earn x of pooled resources a, b and c together", or "earn x of pooled resources a, b or c".
--- @desc As it is a scripted mission, mission objective text must be supplied. Advice may optionally be supplied to be issued with the mission.
--- @p @string unique name, Unique name amongst other declared narrative events.
--- @p @string faction key, Key of the faction to which this narrative event applies, from the <code>factions</code> database table.
--- @p [opt=nil] @string advice key, Key of advice to issue with this mission, if any, from the <code>advice_threads</code> database table.
--- @p @string mission key, Key of mission to issue, from the <code>missions</code> database table.
--- @p @string mission text, Key of mission text to display, from the mission_text database table. This must be set up for scripted missions such as this.
--- @p @string pooled resource key, Key of the pooled resource to monitor, from the <code>pooled_resources</code> database table. This may also be a @table of @string pooled resource keys if multiple pooled resources are to be monitored.
--- @p @number lower threshold, Lower threshold level of the pooled resource(s) at which the mission completes. If not supplied, then there is no lower pooled resource bound at which the mission completes.
--- @p @number upper threshold, Upper threshold level of the pooled resource(s) at which the mission completes. If not supplied, then there is no upper pooled resource bound at which the mission completes. One or both of the lower and upper thresholds must be provided.
--- @p @boolean additive, If set to <code>true</code> the value of all supplied specified pooled resources is counted towards the threshold value. If <code>false</code> is supplied, then the mission only completes when one of the pooled resources specified reaches the threshold value.
--- @p [opt="clan_elders"] @string mission issuer, Key of mission issuer, from the <code>mission_issuers</code> database table.
--- @p @table mission rewards, Rewards to add to the mission. This should be a table of strings. See the documentation for @mission_manager:add_payload for more information on the string formatting and available options.
--- @p @string trigger message, Script message on which the narrative event should trigger. This can also be a @table of strings if multiple trigger messages are desired.
--- @p [opt=nil] @string on-issued message, Message to trigger when the narrative event has finished issuing. This can be a @table of strings if multiple on-issued messages are desired.
--- @p [opt=nil] @string on-completed message, Message to trigger when the mission has completed. This can be a @table of strings if multiple on-completed messages are desired.
